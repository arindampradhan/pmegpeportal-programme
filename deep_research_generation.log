Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

2025-08-18 04:16:34,779 - ERROR - OpenAI legacy client failed: 

You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

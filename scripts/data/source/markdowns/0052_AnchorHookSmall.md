ANCHOR Introduction: An anchor is a device, normally made of metal used to hold things. Without the right anchor, no structure can be held together safely; for choosing the right anchor first the entire structure to be examined. Anchor fasteners also differ with the base material used during the construction, as if the material is drywell than the anchor fasteners are used for covering studded walls and ceilings in both commercial and residential purpose. The technological advancement in fasteners technology will further boost the demand for anchor fasteners. A hook is a tool that is used to connect, grab onto, or attach itself to another object or thing. Generally, one end of a hook is pointed and sharp so that it can penetrate another substance such as a wall, and the other end is generally curved or indented so that the hook is connected to another object. Anchor are an essential part of daily life. In a household it is used for multiple purposes, such as hanging hand towels, coats, dog leads, mirrors, wall pieces, pictures, and various other household items or lightweight fixtures. Utility hooks can be made of metal, wood, or plastic and are also coated with zinc or metal to increase its life.

Uses & Application of Anchor: Anchors are required to resist forces in two directions. Pull-out forces are those that act in the direction of the axis of the fastener. Shear forces are those forces that act at right angles to the axis of the fastener. A hook is a tool consisting of a length of material, typically metal, that contains a portion that is curved or indented, such that it can be used to grab onto, connect, or otherwise attach itself onto another object. A hook is a hand tool used for securing and moving loads. It consists of a round wooden handle with a strong metal hook about 8" long projecting at a right angle from the center of the handle. The appliance is held in a closed fist with the hook projecting between two fingers. Anchor (Hook) Market Analysis: Across the world, rise in population is increasing the number of households, consequently driving the demand for hooks. Although hooks are a very small household tool, they are highly essential to decorate the walls of a home. Rise in aesthetic sense of people is increasing the demand for utility hooks. By material type, the global hooks market can be segmented into metal, plastic, and wood. By type of mounting, the market can be segmented into ceiling mounted hooks and wall mounted hooks. By distribution channel, the global hooks market is segmented into online and offline. In India, with rise in population, the number of households are also increasing. Rise in number of households are increasing the demand for hooks in India. Description of Machinery & Equipment: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Heavy Hydraulic Press(6 Lac per set) 2 1200000 2.

Raw material requirement: Major raw materials are as follows: S No. Description Amount 1 Mild metal sheet Rs 60-65 per Kg 2 Steel Wire Rs 60-70 per Kg 3 Lubricant Oil Rs 100-110 per Ltr. 4 Bolt Rs 55 per Kg 5 Chemicals(zinc) Rs 20-30 per Kg Average raw material cost per Kg of anchor is Rs. 70-75. Manufacturing Process: Manufacturing process is defined below:  Procurement of raw material  Cutting of metal sheet with the help of Hydraulic Press  After cutting it is converted into leaf structure and coating of zinc is done  Weight measurement & sent to assembly section  In assembly section leaf, anchor and bolt are joined together and product is ready for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of buil ding is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1200Sqft. Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 0hp Manpower Requirement– There a2re requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required

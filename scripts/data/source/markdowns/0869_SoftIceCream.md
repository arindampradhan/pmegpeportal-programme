SOFTY ICE-CREAM INTRODUCTION Softy Ice cream is also known as Soft Serve. Soft serve is a type of ice cream that is softer and less dense than regular ice creams as a result of air being introduced during freezing. Soft serve ice cream has been sold commercially since the late 1930s. Soft serve ice cream is not sold pre-packaged in supermarkets, but is common at fairs, carnivals, amusement parks, restaurants (especially fast food and buffet), and specialty shops. This dessert gives the perfect taste to the consumers. Characteristics Soft serve is generally lower in milk-fat (3% to 6%) than Frozen ice cream (10% to 18%) and is produced at a temperature of about −4 °C (25 °F) compared to ice cream, which is stored at −15 °C (5 °F). Soft serve contains air, introduced at the time of freezing. The amount of air alters the taste of the finished product. Product with low quantities of air has a heavy, icy taste and appears more yellow. Ice cream with higher air content tastes creamier, smoother, and lighter and appears whiter. The optimum quantity of air is determined by other ingredients, if any, and individual taste.

Ingredients Softy ice cream is made from Milk, ice-cream powder, softy cone. Also, it contains flavour (natural and nature identical flavouring substances). Flavours Softy Ice cream have come a long way from the standard vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate. By the 1970s, the International Association of Ice Cream Manufacturers had recorded over 400 different flavours of ice cream. In an ever-expanding array of combinations, fruit purees and extracts, cocoa powder, nuts, cookie pieces, and cookie dough are blended into the ice cream mixture. This dessert comes in many flavours & was developed entirely in India. Vanilla  Chocolate  Mango  Orange  Strawberry  Butter Scotch  Besides these, softy Ice cream is also made in other varieties of flavours in various states. Description of Softy Ice-cream Machine Softy ice-cream Machines are used to make softy from the milk & ice- cream powder. All ice cream must be frozen quickly to avoid crystallization. With soft serve, this is accomplished by a special machine at the point of sale. Pre-mixed product is introduced to the storage chamber of the machine. When product is drawn from the draw valve, fresh mix combined with the targeted quantity of air is introduced to the freezing chamber either by gravity or pump. It is then churned and quick frozen and stored until required.

While some machines only dispense one flavour of mix at a time, certain models of soft serve machines have an additional nozzle that dispenses a mixture of two separate flavours simultaneously. This mixture emerges in a distinct swirl pattern. It is classified as its own separate flavour on menus as swirl or twist. Soft serve Current Market Analysis Ice cream today represents one of the fastest growing food segments in India. A recently released report by IMARC Group, titled “Ice Cream Market in India: Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2019-2024”, critically examines the Indian ice cream market. The report finds that the market exhibiting a CAGR of 16.9% during 2011-2018. The healthy growth of the market can be attributed to numerous forces. Population growth, rising disposable incomes, urbanisation rates, changing consumer preferences are some of the factors that are broadening the growth aspects of the market. According to the report, the market is further expected to reach a value of INR 375.8 Billion during 2019-2024. Softy Ice-cream Process The production process begins with the procurement of raw material: Milk & Ice-cream powder. The procurement of raw material depends on the quality parameters set by the producer. Production begins by mixing & bleeding of raw material. After that material is pour into the hopper and mixture freeze at -40C for 10-15 minutes (to harden the material) Machinery required: Types of Machinery: 1. Table top model Softy ice cream 2. Floor Model Softy ice cream

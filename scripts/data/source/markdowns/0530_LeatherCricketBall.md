LEATHER CRICKET BALL MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Cricket is the most popular game in our country but it is also played all over the world; cricket is mainly played in commonwealth countries. After partition of the country in 1947, large number of workers migrated to India. They have subsequently settled down in Meerut (U. P.) and Jalandhar (Punjab), where they started manufacturing cricket balls. India is the leading manufacturer of Cricket balls and have been in practise in England for centuries. But the undue increase in labour cost and rising demand for the product, the balls prices got unreasonable in Great Britain and the centre of ball manufacturing shifted to India. As per survey conducted in 2014, over 90 percent of leather cricket balls are made in India. Meerut and Ludhiana contribute maximum to the above percentage, as maximum number of leather cricket ball manufacturing units are based in these two cities of India.

Uses & Market Potential: Cricket balls are traditionally red, and red balls are used in Test cricket and First- class cricket but proposals to introduce other colours date back at least as early as 1937. Red balls are more durable than white balls. Due to this reason, the red cricket balls can be used for 80 overs or more. The production is about 180 thousand dozens per year valued more than Rupees 300 lakhs. The demand for quality goods is increasing hence there is a scope for another 10 to 15 new units every year. The important raw materials required for the manufacturing of cricket balls is leather, thread, cork, polishes and wool. Fortunately, all the items mentioned above except cork are indigenously available. Cork will have to be imported. Product: Leather Cricket Ball Raw Material: The raw materials are mentioned below:  Cork-rubber  Leather  Packing Material Manufacturing Process: The steps are:  Raw material procurement  Leather seasoning and cutting of leather to length

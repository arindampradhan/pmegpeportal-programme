PP BOX STRAPPING Strap is commonly used in the packaging industry to secure or fasten items. It may be made from a wide range of materials, such as plastic, steel, paper, or fabric. Usually the strap is secured to itself through various means, but it may also be secured to other items, such as pallets. PP Strap (polypropylene strapping) is currently the most common used plastic strapping. The later developed Strap PET is of a better quality but this is also noticeable in the price. PP Strap meets the required properties, such as tensile strength, elasticity and tension loss for many applications without failure. Recognition: Polypropylene is often dull and usually has a checkered profile and is available in a few standard colours, black, bleu, white and yellow. PP Strap in the longitudinal direction is easy to tear, and the specific gravity is lower than that of PET strap. PP strap stays afloat on water. The strap is secured by a heat weld, but also by making use of a buckle, depending on the application and the volume, with a hand-held device, strapping tool (semi-automatic) or a strapping machine (fully automatic). Polypropylene strap (oriented or tensilized) is an economical material designed for light to medium duty unitizing, palletizing and bundling. It is available in various widths, thicknesses, and polymer variations (e.g., copolymers). Most polypropylene is embossed, some of which is also printed. This product offers higher elongation at break but tends to have irrecoverable dead stretch with constant stress. What is not generally known to end users is that polypropylene strapping will lose about 50% of the applied tension within one hour, and that this tension loss is accelerated with increases in ambient temperature, consequently

although suitable for packs with a degree of stored energy that will take up any relaxation that occurs in the strap, unacceptable strap slackness may occur after time if used on product that is 'Solid' such as bricks or concrete. Furthermore polypropylene strapping is susceptible to UV degradation and can quickly degrade if left outside exposed to the elements. The sensible choice of colour will retard the process, such as specifying black strap. Similarly, a UV inhibitor can be specified. Polypropylene strapping may be printed, either during production and pre- embossing for the highest quality and precision, or post production over the embossing for a reduced quality. Both offer security and marketing advantages to the strapped product. Strapping, also known as bundling and banding, is the process of applying a strap to an item to combine, stabilize, hold, reinforce, or fasten it. The strap may also be referred to as strapping. Strapping is most commonly used in the packaging industry. Features: 1. Durability 2. Abrasion resistance 3. Moisture-proof Application for Quality Products PET straps are primarily used in transportation of different materials from one place to another. They prevent these materials from getting damaged. PET straps are light in weight and cost effective vis-à-vis steel straps. There are factors driving the PET strap market. PET straps are primarily made from recycled PET. Thus, they provide environment-friendly strapping solution. Manufacturing process of PP Box Strapping The various additives like plasticizer, stabilizers etc are added along with PP resin to the mixer of extrusion unit after measuring the weight of each individual raw material; the mixer mixes all raw material into a homogenous blend which is then feed to extruder via a hopper and feeder arrangement.

The Extruder heats the blend above its glass transition temperature so as to obtain a semi-solid PP, which is forced through a die to form four PP Straps simultaneously which are continuously extruded. These straps are plunged in a quenching tank in order to quickly cool them to prevent any deformation, followed by which these straps are pulled in by a Power Take-Off Unit. The power take-off unit utilizes appropriate gearbox and motor set to generate required speed and torque at roller, which ultimately transfer this power to PP Straps; therefore the PP Straps are pulled out of quenching tank feed to Hot Air Tunnel Oven. The Hot Air Tunnel Oven is a hot air circulation system within an enclosed space that is utilized to heat these straps and as an another take-off unit is placed across the oven the PP straps are under constant tension and along with thermal effect due to oven heating the straps experience elongation thus their thickness is further reduced. Another take-off unit across the oven pulls the straps out of oven and feeds it to embossing unit, which generates pattern over these straps which allows better grip during box strapping at users end. The printer unit is next to embossing unit which simply prints certain information on to straps as per customer or manufacturers requirement, if printed PP straps are to be produced. These straps are then feed to Annealing Oven with Quenching Tank which has its own feed mechanism to move the straps through quenching tank. It essentially heats the PP straps so as to relive work stresses, thus enhances life and strength of straps followed by which they are cooled in its quenching tank to room temperature. Another take-off unit is placed across the annealing oven which pulls the PP straps from oven and feeds them to 6-Station strap winder, which winds the 4 straps simultaneously over their respective cardboard cores. These straps rolls are packed in cartons and sent for sale.

PP Box Strapping Market analysis PET straps are largely used by the cotton industry, which accounts for a 45% share, followed by automotive, appliance, and others. India has about 30 manufacturers, with the western region being the principal supplier. The market is expected to record a high CAGR of 14% from 2015 to 2020. There has been a rise in demand for consumer electronics, household appliances, pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and textile goods, which is projected to result in an increase in demand for strapping material as a suitable packaging material. Growth in mail orders and the logistics business, along with expansion of the e-commerce industry, is projected to further boost the demand for strapping materials. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for manufacturing process of PP Box Strapping.  Extruder  Quenching Tank  First Stretching Unit  Orientation Unit  Second Stretching Unit  Printing Unit  Embossing Unit  Air Annealing Oven with water chilling unit  Third Stretching Unit  Three Station PLC Winder Unit

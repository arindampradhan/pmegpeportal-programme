1. INTRODUCTION Biogas is the mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen (anaerobically), primarily consisting of methane and carbon dioxide. Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, manure, municipal waste, plant material, sewage, green waste or food waste. Biogas is a renewable energy source. In India, it is also known as "Gobar Gas". Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with methanogen or anaerobic organisms, which digest material inside a closed system, or fermentation of biodegradable materials. This closed system is called an anaerobic digester, biodigester or a bioreactor. Biogas is primarily methane (CH ) and carbon dioxide (CO ) and may have small amounts of 4 2 hydrogen sulfide (H S), moisture and siloxanes. The gases methane, hydrogen, and carbon 2 monoxide (CO) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel; it can be used for any heating purpose, such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat. Biogas can be compressed after removal of Carbon dioxide, the same way as natural gas is compressed to CNG, and used to power motor vehicles. In the United Kingdom, for example, biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel. It qualifies for renewable energy subsidies in some parts of the world. Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards, when it becomes bio-methane. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production-and-use cycle is continuous, and it generates no net carbon dioxide. As the organic material grows, it is converted and used. It then regrows in a continually repeating cycle. From a carbon perspective, as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio-resource as is released, when the material is ultimately converted to energy.

Bio-CNG is produced from biogas, through a simple and convenient processinvolving desulphurisation, upgradation and compression. First, biogas isde-sulphurated if the hydrogen sulphide content is over 1,500 ppm. Then, thede-sulphurated biogas is upgraded to make its composition similar to CNG,followed by the compression and bottling of the resulting bio- CNG. Composition of Biogas: Component Content [%] Methane, CH 4 50-75 Carbon Dioxide, CO 2 25-50 Hydrogen Sulphide, H 2 S 0-3 Other Gases 0-13 Composition of Bio-CNG: Component Content [%] Methane, CH 4 92-98 Carbon Dioxide, CO 2-8 2 Nitrogen, N 0-3 2 Calorific Value: Gaseous Fuel Calorific Value (MJ/Kg) Biogas 31 CNG 50 Bio-CNG 52 LNG 54 LPG 55 Physical Properties of Bio-CNG:  It is hydrocarbon component with methane as a major component.  It is colorless and odorless.

 For security during, transportation or processing, a commercial odorant is added to allow users to detect the gas for safety.  It is lighter than air with a specific gravity of about 0.6-0.8. If leaks, it disperses upward and dissipates into the air quickly.  It is inflamed during a range of 5-15% by volume of gas in air.  The self-ignition temperature of natural gas is 537-540 degrees celsius.  As it is a clean fuel with cleaner burning nature, natural gas has lower environmental impact when compared with other types of fuel. Types of Biogas Plant: Classification of biogas plants depends upon the plants design and mode of working.  Batch Type Biogas Plant  Continuous Type Plant  Movable Type Drums Plant Batch Type Biogas Plant- Salient Features-  Gas production in batch type is uneven.  Batch type plants may use several digesters for continuous supply of gas.  This type of plants requires large volume of digester; therefore, initial cost becomes high.  This plant needs addition of fermented slurry to start the digestion process. Continuous Type Biogas Plant- Salient features  Gas production is continuous  Retention period is less  Less problems as compared to batch type  Small digestion chambers are required Movable drum type Plants  Constant Gas pressure  No problem of gas leakage  Higher gas production

 Scum problem is less. Application of Biogas  Automotive  Locomotives  IC Engine Power Generators 2. PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Bio-CNG is being utilised to replace CNG as an automobile fuel (for CNG buses and tractors) and LPG as a cooking fuel at Mahindra World City, as well as to power street lighting. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT  Crop waste  Animal waste  Municipal waste  Agro-Industry Waste  Forestry Waste Consumables:  Membranes of Multi-Stage Membrane Purification System  Media used in Scrubber for Absorption (Caustic Solution in most cases) 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process of Bio-CNG is a two-stage process, first stage is generation of Biogas, while second stage is processing of Biogas into Bio-CNG. The details of same are mentioned below; Biogas Production:

 The various food waste is procured form agro-industry & municipal bodies, while the Cow-dung is obtained from dairy farms & farmer groups. All these raw materials are stored in appropriate storage facilities composed of bins and appropriate enclosing structure.  The food waste is sent to crusher which essentially crushes the various sizes food waste into an appropriate size & form to be used for making slurry. This crushed food waste, along with Cow-dung is added to slurry tank with water.  The slurry tank has its own agitator to form a uniform slurry. The Slurry is then pumped into digester of biogas plant which essentially decomposes the organic waste, releasing mostly methane and other gases, which are collectively called as biogas.  The gas deposits in dome or floating cover, from where it’s extracted via flow control valve periodically.  The used slurry or sludge is pumped out of digester into a sludge tank which can be used as manure.  The biogas is collected in a large gas receiver from, where it’s sucked in by compressor and collected in its receiver, which acts as a temporary holding tank. This gas is then either filled in large pressure vessels from where the supply is provided to Bio-CNG Processing Plant. Bio-CNG Production from Biogas:  The biogas is received from a storage vessel from biogas production plant, which is then fed to a dehumidifier which essential removes water vapours from gas and the required refrigeration effect is generated by a refrigeration plant.  The dehumidified biogas is then fed to a repeater which essentially raises the temperature of biogas slightly for Hydrogen sulphide absorption, for which the biogas after reheating is fed to a hydrogen sulphide scrubber, while in case of bigger plants nitrogen scrubbers are also installed which further purify the biogas.  This partially purified biogas is then fed to a compressor, which compresses the biogas to necessary pressure for membrane purification system, this compressed biogas is collected in its receiver which also acts as a holding tank for membrane purification system.  Three stage membrane purification system is most widely used in which, first stage of membrane purification system separates gas into carbon dioxide rich gas and methane

rich gas, the carbon dioxide rich gas is supplied to second stage of membrane purification system which further extracts most possible methane out of carbon dioxide rich gas and supplies it back to methane rich gas.  The methane rich gas is then supplied to third stage of membrane purification system, which essentially extracts most possible carbon dioxide out of methane rich gas, the methane rich gas at this point is called as Bio-NG which is supplied to THT Gas injector system.  On the other hand, carbon dioxide form Three Stage Membrane Purification System is fed to a compressor which compresses the carbon dioxide and collects it, in its receiver, from where it’s supplied to a storage pressure vessel.  Appropriate gas pressure regulator & connectors are used to fill this stored carbon dioxide into gas cylinder which are then sold as by-product. The Bio-NG which is fed to THT Gas Injector is injected with THT (Tetrahydrothiophene) Gas and due to injection of THT Gas into stream of Bio-NG they get mixed properly.  THT Gas is basically an odorant used in LPG and CNG to detect leakage by smell. The Bio-NG is then fed to a High-Pressure Compressor which simply compresses the Bio- NG in order to obtain Bio-CNG, this Bio-CNG is then collected in a receiver vessel of the compressor, from where the Bio-CNG is supplied to a high-pressure storage vessel.  Appropriate gas pressure regulator, hoses, connectors, control valves etc, are used to fill this stored Bio-CNG into large gas cylinders or cylinder cascades which are then sold in market or in many plants this stored Bio-CNG is directly filled into pressure vessel mounted on the truck which carry it to gas stations.

KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON HURRAICHI CHAPPALS & SANDALS Introduction : Hurraichi Chappals and Sandal are mainly used as casual sleeper during summer. This item is solely manufactured in India and not likely to have competition from other countries. Its production and productivity have to be increased in relation to increasing demand. The process of manufacture is on craft basis and fully hand made. Standardization should be effected to ensure uniformity in quality and increase in production at minimum cost. This industry should be broad based to enable trade to earn more and more foreign exchange and continue to maintain its grip on the expost market. Raw materials for the manufacture of these chappals and sandal are indigenously available and there is no dearth of raw materials as well as labour for manufacture of this item.

TANK TRUCK Introduction Tank truck, gas truck, fuel truck, or tanker truck or tanker, is a motor vehicle designed to carry liquefied loads, dry bulk cargo or gases on roads. The largest such vehicles are similar to railroad tank cars which are also designed to carry liquefied loads. Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids that can be transported. Tank trucks tend to be large; they may be insulated or non-insulated; pressurized or non- pressurized; and designed for single or multiple loads (often by means of internal divisions in their tank). Some are semi-trailer trucks. They are difficult to drive due to their high centre of gravity. General Description A tank truck is distinguished by its shape, usually a cylindrical tank upon the vehicle lying horizontally. Some less visible distinctions amongst tank trucks have to do with their intended use: compliance with human food regulations, refrigeration capability, acid resistance, pressurization capability, and more. The tanks themselves will almost always contain multiple compartments or baffles to prevent load movement destabilizing the vehicle. Oil tankers are transport vehicle that move bulk volumes of oil from the oil extraction facility to the refinery. A truck is a oil tanker that is built specifically for transporting oil (as opposed to refined oil). The firm that owns the truck hires the tanker under a complicated contract to oil marketers, oil refiners, chemical companies, or other users like contractors representing governments. Contract terms vary based on the length of the contract, the quantity of oil to be transported and the route of transport. The contract also includes details of who will bear operational expenses like fuel costs, crew payments and insurance.

Factors Impacting the Oil Tanker Business An oversupply in crude oil production results in high demand and mass movement of crude oil which is good for the crude tanker business. Along with oil supply, geopolitical developments also play an important role in the Oil tanker business. Asian economies like China, India, Japan and South Korea are currently importing a significant portion of crude oil from the Atlantic Basin. Once Iranian oil is available, Asian economies will likely ship from the geographically closer Iran. Crude oil tankers will see greater transportation volume once Iran begins exporting more oil (and higher revenues. Additionally, competition among different fuelling centres located across the globe also impacts truck fuel prices and hence the crude tanker revenues. For instance, because of increasing competition from Crude tankers benefit from price declines. Different types of oil will often be routed to refineries in countries where there is also a demand for the by product or end product. For instance, kerosene is used extensively in India as a fuel. Crude oil from the Middle East is especially suited for creating kerosene. An increase in the demand for kerosene in India will result in more demand for transportation of Middle Eastern crude oil to Indian refineries. Plant & Machinery required: Description Quantity Value Tanker (6 tyres) 2 50,00,000 Total Cost 2 50,00,000 * Machine Value is inclusive of GST & other transportation cost. Manpower Requirement: 4 Manpower are required for running & operation of two trucks.

BAMBOO PELLETS MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Pelletizing is the process of compressing material into solid waste. The most common products of pelletizing are wood pellets. The is because wood pellets are easily available and are made from different types of agro-forestry waste including soybean husks, tea waste, palm husks, wheat straw, and bamboo dust. Bamboo pellets are small and look like enlarged capsules, they are often shiny and appear as furnished wood pieces. Bamboo pellets are created of bamboo trunks, bamboo leaves, and recycling bamboo powders after the creation of other bamboo products, by mashing the bamboo into powder and clasping them concurrently into pellets of 5 to 11mm size. Bamboos are a subfamily of perennial evergreen flowering plants in the family of Poaceae. The largest members of the family are referred to as giant bamboos, the intermodal parts of the stem are hollow while vascular bundles are scattered throughout the stem rather than a cylindrical arrangement. The lack of secondary growth has prompted the bamboos to have a columnar shape rather than tapers. Bamboos are known to be some of the fastest-growing grass because of the special rhizome- dependent system. Some species can grow 0.89 meters within a day. Bamboos are widely known for their cultural and economic significance in the southeast and eastern parts of the Asian continent. They are used as a source of food, building materials among others in Asia.

Uses & Market Potential: Bamboo pellets are used as a source of biomass energy production. They can be used in industrial steam furnaces, heating, and cooking. They can also be used for Medicinal extracts. Bamboo pellets are used in animal feed. They have a crisp nature, lightly sweet flavor as well as exceptional nutritional value. The global bamboo pellets market size is predicted to extend US$ 110.5 million by 2025, at a CAGR of 4.2% during 2021-2025. The wood pellet market is growing at a faster pace with substantial growth rates over the last few years and is estimated that the market will grow significantly in the forecasted period. The market for bamboo pellets has grown unexpectedly in the last few years. Previously large- scale production, Europe, Asia, and America grabbed the largest market share of biomass pellets. Between them, the preceding stays further substantia l, reaching more than 9 million in 2011. When the factories realized their economic and environmental advantages, production and transaction in Latin America and Asia started to emerge. In 2018, the Asia Pacific bamboos pellets demand calculated for over 30% of the profit share and are predicted to glimpse the increased expansion over the forecast time. Presently, various govt programs focus on promoting bamboo products and rattan cultivation to navigate endurable earnings for farmers. These govt strategies are predicted to relate new

avenues for the market growth of bamboo pellets. The bamboo pellet has been gaining attention and awareness over the recent 2 eras for its financial and environmental importance. Product: Bamboo Pellets Raw Material: The raw material that is required for bamboo pellets is: Wood: Bamboo trunks or stalks, leaves, and powders, or other bamboo products. The entire bamboo plant, including the stem, branch, and rhizome, can be used to produce bamboo pellets, making it highly resource-efficient, with limited wastage. Residues produced from bamboo products or furniture manufacturing such as sawdust and shavings also serve as an important raw material source. Manufacturing Process: The steps are:  Raw material procurement  Production Process  Testing  Packaging Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is

PROJECT REPORT ON ARECA NUT PALM LEAF CROCKERY INTRODUCTION : This Enterprise is a proposed micro enterprise for the manufacture of Palm plates Now a day the importance of biodegradable materials is very high since polyethylene wastes poses severe threat to the universe. The disposable plates and food packing materials manufactured from easily available areca nut palm leaves is a better substitute for disposable polythene and paper plates. The Govt. is restricting the use of plastic materials and hence eco-friendly products are preferred to plastic products. There is an ever increasing demand for these items. Keeping this in mind, the promoter has ventured this unit. The raw material Areca nut palm Belongs to the Catechu Family of palm tree species. India leads the production followed by China and Bangladesh. In India it is grown in Karnataka, Kerala, Assam, Maharashtra, West Bengal and parts of Tripura. In India 4 lack hectors of areca crop has been cultivated. Near about 5400 million areca leaves are shredded and treated as Agro Waste. It is Perfect Alternate to Plastics/Polymer/ Thermocol/ Styrofoam based products and crockery A 100% natural mechanism is followed for manufacturing these plates. Areca Leaves are collected from grounds by farmers. The thick sheaths of the areca leaf are cleaned and soaked in water for approximately 15 minutes and dried for 30 minutes. They are then compressed to different shapes using the correspondingly shaped dies in different machines. They are then packed as per the customer requirement. Advantages of Areca Crockery

• Eco-friendly, Bio-degradable and Compostable • No chopping down of trees, fallen leaves are collected and turned to VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS. ‘Waste to Wealth’ Concept. • No Chemicals, Bleaching, PE (Poly Ethylene) Coating, Wax Coating at any stage • Light weight, Sturdy and Non-crushable. • Microwave & Refrigerator Safe. • Holds liquid items for 4 hours without leakage. Good for hot, wet and cold food items. • Food plates thrown after eating will be naturally degraded within 60 days of time like any plant matter. • Manufacturing waste of Areca sheaths will be used for vermin compost, dry fodder for animals, bio-fuel bricks. • Will increase work efficiency and resource optimization: Using Areca ware will save water and human efforts to wash utensils. MARKETING: The product has a supply constraint in the market and the demand is very high. The market is expected to have a sustained higher growth for the coming years. The Govt. policies, changing trend and sustainable development concept will increase the importance of the product and its marketability. Areca nut leaf crockery are targeted towards the high end of the market. First quality products are targeted for International market Willingness to buy ecofriendly products is highest in Vietnam and Indonesia, while New Zealand, Thailand and Malaysia prioritize purchase based on value for money and promotions.

GAURA STONE HANDICRAFT UNIT Introduction: India a country with tremendous workmanship and writing is a land wealthy in different societies, plans, identity, sacred texts, engineer and some more. The stone art holds a unique spot in the realm of workmanship and art. Gaura stone has a delicate surface. It is cut into a few pieces which are then utilized for making different specialty things that are utilized for fancy reason. Craftsmen from Mahoba are known worldwide for their remarkable works of art of unequaled examples of Gaura stone handiwork. The craftsmen in Gaurahari town of Mahoba District rehearsed once a flourishing and famous specialty of Gaurahari Stonework, wherein they made a wide scope of painstaking work, out of a specific hued stone called 'Gaura Patthar', known for its delicate surface. In any case, because of the disappointment of any supported mediation, absence of interest roads, and inflexible government standards on mining of Gaura Stone, they have almost lost any desire for any future for their specialty. The public authority is attempting to patch up the item and make it a significant item back in the area. In this undertaking we have examined Gaura Stone items like Gaura workmanship and specialty marble flower vase & decorative showpieces. In India Handicrafts not only represent an industry but also mirror the way of life, ethos, and customs of a billion people. Notwithstanding, because of an absence of Innovation and Creativity in its strategies, the handiwork business has lost its substance and the craftsmen of the nation are helpless before a couple of individuals. Gaurahari Stonework includes handcrafting items like sculptures, home stylistic theme, and utility things out of an uncommon stone called 'Gaura Stone' known for its interesting brilliance and rich surface. All the items are made by the craftsmen utilizing instruments and gear which are created by them as it were. At a certain point as expected, the craftsmen were broadly perceived for their ability and greatness. In any case, absence of interest roads, shutting down of Gaurahari Mines and unavailability to innovation has pushed the craftsmen of Gaurahari to obscurity.

Uses & Market Potential: Gaura stone art is made of brilliant white shaded stone that is dominatingly found in this district. The stone specialty holds an exceptional spot in the realm of workmanship and art. Gaura stone has a delicate surface. It is cut into a few pieces which are then utilized for making different specialty things that are utilized for ornamental reason. The karigars of Gaurahari are the guardians of the well-established novel stone art rehearsed since the nineteenth century. Because of conclusion of the town stone mines by the public authority and absence of mindfulness about the art, the local area of 200 craftsmen diminished to a simple 10. There was once a flourishing and prestigious art of Gaurahari stonework, wherein they made a wide scope of crafted works, sculptures and decorative utensils out of a specific hued stone called gaura patthar. The delicate surface and brilliance of the stone made it appropriate for such work. More than 70% of Gaurahari's craftsmen were subject to the exchange. Be that as it may, Stones from Gaura Hill were once utilized by experts to create perfect. Red sculptures of Buddha made of Gaura stone have been in enormous interest in China. The town is lined by a few slopes made of this stone, which they dug for crude material and offered to a few urban communities outside the state. It was among the numerous famous workmanship things of Uttar Pradesh. As indicated by state government gauges, UP alone contributes 44% of the all-out craftsmanship sends

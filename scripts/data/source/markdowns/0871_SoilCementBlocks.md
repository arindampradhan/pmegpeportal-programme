PROJECT PROFILE ON SOIL CEMENT BLOCKS INTRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCT Soil cement blocks are cost effective and energy efficient alternative materials to the normal burnt clay bricks used for construction of buildings. Soil cement blocks are also known as stabilized mud blocks (SMB) or stabilized compressed earth block (SCEB). Ordinary Portland cement is the most usual stabiliser added 5 to 10% by weight to the soil. Other stabilisers like lime, puzzolana or a combination of cement and lime are also used. Soil cement blocks being usually 2 ½ times larger in size the normal burnt clay bricks, the construction is faster and the joints are consequently reduced. The less number of joints also result in cutting down the amount of mortar required. From the environmental considerations also, use of soil cement blocks in construction work result a substantial saving of energy as no fuel is required for its manufacture. While in general building construction, soil cement blocks may be used as a substitute for normal burnt clay bricks, their use should be avoided in the case of isolated load bearing columns, piers and such heavily loaded structures. 2

MARKET & DEMAND ASPECTS Housing is one of the three basic necessities of human life. Demand for housing is always far exceeds the supply. There is bound to be good scope for projects of this nature. Traditionally, the burnt clay brick has been the common form of building construction material. There are other alternative construction materials like natural stone, cement concrete hollow blocks, etc. Soil cement blocks are the ideal construction materials for low cost housing projects undertaken by the government under various housing schemes for upbringing of the common man. A number of government agencies are promoting the usage of this alternative building material in the construction activities. Public awareness about the low cost housing using alternative building materials is more pronounced in urban areas rather than in rural areas where it is more required to be promoted. There is a need for suitable mechanism by which more and more rural housing schemes using low cost building materials are encouraged.

(3) Efficiency: 60% utilisation of machinery and manpower has been considered. (4) Labour wages: Minimum wages applicable for semi-skilled and unskilled workers were taken into consideration. (5) Working shifts per day: It is envisaged that the enterprise will be in operation on single shift of 8 hours per day basis for 300 working days in year. (6) Implementation period: Project implementation period of 6 months is envisaged RAW MATERIALS Soil or raw earth is the principal raw material. Ordinary Portland cement and water are other two constituents required for manufacture of soil cement blocks. Sand and crushed stone dust may also be added to the soil depending on the type of soil. Lime and puzzolana cement are the alternative soil stabilizing materials may also be used. A combination of cement and lime is also used as a soil stabilizer. MANUFACTURING PROCESS The process of manufacture of soil cement blocks involves the following five steps:; (1) Analysis of the soil (2) Sifting of the soil (3) Preparation of the mix (4) Compaction of the blocks (5) Curing of the blocks (1) Analysis of the soil Soil composition and analysis through comprehensive tests in a laboratory is very important. This will be required to estimate amount of cement, and other missing native constituents that must be added to the final mix. All soils are made up of three components: sand, silt, and clay. These components are defined on the basis of particle size, sand being the coarsest of the three and clay the finest. Optimum composition of soil for soil cement blocks is made up of approximately 75% sand and only 25% of silt and clay. The clay content should never comprise less than 10% or more than 50% of the soil. Most soils , when reasonably free from vegetable matter, can be satisfactorily with cement, lime or cement and lime. We can get a rough idea of the composition of the soil by simply picking up a handful and feeling it. Sand naturally has a coarse and gritty texture, while silt has the consistency of flour. Moist clay is smooth to the touch, is somewhat sticky, and will form a ribbon as you compress it between your thumb and forefinger. We can estimate the percentages of each of the three components in the soil: (1) Fill a straight-sided glass jar about one-full of soil. (2) Add an equal amount of water. (3) Cover the jar and shake vigorously to suspend all the dirt. (4) Finally, allow the slurry to sit undisturbed about 30 minutes or until the soil has settled into three separate layers with the sand at the bottom. 4

(2) Sifting of soil Soil should be dried and sieved (to remove large lumps, stones, leaves, and other impurities) before it can be used properly mixed with cement and compressed into blocks. Sturdy frames with metallic meshes can be used for sifting of soil. The soil has the proper moisture content for sifting when (1) a handful can be squeezed without water appearing on its surface, and (2) the ball of soil disintegrates without lumps as it is released. (3) Preparation of the mix Once soil has been dried and sifted, we can begin to prepare the mix from which blocks will be pressed. The amount of Portland cement to be used will depend on the composition of the soil. Sandy soils require 5 to 9% cement by volume. Silty soils need 8 to 12%, and clay soils require 12 to 15% cement as stabiliser. More than 15% by volume is not recommended. Mix thoroughly all the ingredients: cement, soil, and special additions such as sand or clay that may be needed. After drying mixing of all the ingredients, water is added a little at a time until the damp soil-cement reaches the right consistency. We can use a garden hose with te nozzle adjusted to produce a fine spray. A concrete mixer machine is suitable for preparing the mix. Do the simple test to know the right consistency of the mix. Take a small amount of mix and form it into a ball in your hand, the resulting clod should both hold its shape and not stain your palm.. (4) Compaction of the blocks Hydraulic operated machine is proposed in the project for compacting soil- cement into blocks of desired size. Hand-operated machines may also be used in place of power operated machines. The prepared mix can placed into the mould of the machine and pressure is applied and after compaction, the block formed is ejected from the mould and stacked. Delicate touch is needed for removing the fresh blocks from the mould and stacking, as blocks are plastic and fragile when newly formed. (5) Curing of the blocks Place the blocks as soon as possible on a flat, non-absorbent surface in a shady environment to cure. Set each block on edges and space the blocks far enough apart so that they do not touch each other. After 24 hours of moulding blocks must be thoroughly sprinkled three times a day with the fine water spray. The slower the block dry, the stronger they will be. So, during the first four days of curing, blocks be covered 5

with plastic. Blocks may be stacked after four days, but the sprinkling should be continued for another eight days. Finally, three weeks after leaving the mould, the blocks can be used in construction. QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS IS 1725 – 1982: Indian Standard Specification for Soil based Blocks used in General Building Construction (First Revision) (Reaffirmed 1997) The above standard specifies requirements for soil cement blocks on the following parameters: sizes of blocks, compressive strength, water absorption, and weathering. PRODUCTION CAPACITY The plant and machinery proposed in the project has a production capacity of 900000 Nos. of soil cement blocks of size 29 x 9 x 9 cm. At 75% utilization of the capacity, productions of 720000 Nos. of blocks have been taken into consideration. The above mentioned Indian Standard specification IS 1725 – 1982 specifies the following three sizes for soil cement blocks: 29 x 19 x 9 cm, 19 x 9 x 9 cm and 19 x 9 x 4 cm. Although soil cement blocks of all the three sizes could be made using the same machinery and equipment proposed in the project, for computation purpose only one size, viz 29 x 19 x 9 cm is considered in the sales turnover. UTILITIES Electrical Power requirement: 25 HP power for industrial purpose is required. Water: water used should be free from acids, alkalis, oil, dissolved carbon dioxide and decayed vegetable matter. Generally, water suitable for human consumption is considered adequate for using with soil-cement mix.

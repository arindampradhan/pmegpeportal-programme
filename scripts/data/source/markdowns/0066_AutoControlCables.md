1. INTRODUCTION Auto Control cables are parts of the two & three wheelers which come into play in controlling the movement of the vehicle. These are actually flexible link motions and assist in the starting, accelerating and stopping of the Vehicle. The auto control cables connect the clutch and gear controls in the handles / hand grips of the vehicle to the clutch housing, wheel brakes and the gear box. The control cable consists of a closed spiral spring coated with plastic with an inner core of standard steel wire. The cable is provided at either end, with suitable lugs or ferrule to fit into the specific part to which it is to be connected. The auto control cables are used very frequently, while the vehicle is in motion, as these are in action whenever clutch is engaged, gears are changed and brakes applied. Due to the frequent use, these are also replaced often due to wear or breakage. 2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Automotive control cables are the most imperative parts of the automotive industry. These cables are used for control of mechanical movements in variety of machines/ systems including aerospace and vehicles. But maximum quantity is consumed by two-wheeler segment in automobile sector. These products are essential for almost all two-wheeler and other automobile systems. The range of this product are Two-Wheeler Cables for Motorcycles, Scooters, Electric Bikes and Mopeds, Three-Wheeler Cables for Load Carriers and Passenger Carriers, Passenger Car Cables, Tractor Cables, Commercial Vehicle Cables for Light Commercial Vehicles, Buses and Trucks, Snowmobile Cables, Cables for Construction, Earth Moving and Material Handling Equipment.

The automotive control cable market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5% during the forecast period of 2019-2029. The global automotive control cable market size in 2018 was valued at US$ 2.1 Bn. The global automotive control cable market is an extremely fragmented market. Tier-1 players hold approximately 35-45% share in the market. Most of the key players sustain strategic focus on the development of new products and expansion of business in new regions and setup of the distribution network. Significant investments in developing new and durable products by companies are expected to exploit the automotive control cable market growth prospects. PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL The major raw material required for manufacturing of Auto Control Cable are: ➢ Spring steel wire-carbon ➢ Medium carbon steel wire ➢ Zinc alloy/type metal for lugs ➢ PVC Granules ➢ Tin Solder / Ferrules etc ➢ Packing materials MANUFACTURING PROCESS The Auto Control Cable consists of two main parts. ➢ One is the inner core, made of fine stranded steel wires twisted as a single rope with suitable lugs / ferrules (if required) at either ends for fixing the same into the particular components of the vehicle between which the linkage is to be effected. ➢ The other is the outer casing which is a long spiral spring coated with a layer of plastic material with suitable ends for fitting into the appropriate parts. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building

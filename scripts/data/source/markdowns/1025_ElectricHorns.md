1. INTRODUCTION A electric horn is a sound-making device that can be equipped to motor vehicles, buses, bicycles, trains, trams (otherwise known as streetcars in North America), and other types of vehicles. The sound made usually resembles a "honk" (older vehicles) or a "beep" (modern vehicles). The driver uses the horn to warn others of the vehicle's approach or presence, or to call attention to some hazard. Motor vehicles, ships and trains are required by law in some countries to have horns. Like trams, trolley cars and streetcars, bicycles are also legally required to have an audible warning device in many areas, but not universally, and not always a horn. Oliver Lucas of Birmingham, England, developed a standard electric horn in 1910. Car horns are usually electric, driven by a flat circular steel diaphragm that has an electromagnet acting on it in one direction and a spring pulling in the opposite direction. The diaphragm is attached to contact points that repeatedly interrupt the current to that electromagnet causing the diaphragm to spring back the other way, which completes the circuit again. This arrangement opens and closes the circuit hundreds of times per second, which creates a loud noise like a buzzer or electric bell, which sound enters a horn to be amplified. There is usually a screw to adjust the distance/tension of the electrical contacts for best operation. A spiral exponential horn shape (sometimes called the "snail") is cast into the body of the horn, to better match the acoustical impedance of the diaphragm with open air, and thus more effectively transfer the sound energy. Sound levels of typical car horns are approximately 107–109 decibels, and they typically draw 5-6 amperes of current.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Electronic horns are used on vehicles to give out warning signals generated by an electronic circuit. A solenoid is magnetized and demagnetized to produce the fundamental frequency and cause the diaphragm to vibrate. This generates high pressure that passes through the trumpet horn to generate a sound. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS A typical electric horn consists of a flexible metal diaphragm (usually made of spring steel), a coil of wire that forms an electromagnet, a switch and a housing that functions somewhat like a megaphone. The entire apparatus functions according to Hooke’s Law, which states, “The extension of a spring is directly proportional to the load applied, provided the limit of proportionality is not exceeded.” This manufacturing process can be broken down into the following steps  Press Shop The raw material as sheet metal strips is loaded into the press machines. In the press shop, components like housing, diaphragm, tone disc and bracket are manufactured in different press machines. The entire operation is made in a single press and comes ready for painting. Diaphragm and tone disc should be manufactured at high levels of accuracy; Roots Industries does this – manufacturing with high precision.  Painting Once the components are manufactured in the press shop, they are sent to the paint shop, where they go through several stages before painting. The company uses powder coating to avoid rust and other external damage; therefore, it is treated in a sequence of operations to remove rust, oil and water. The paint shop is a single line process, where the components are fed in at one end and painted at the end of the line. In this line, the components first enter the degreasing line, where the oil present in them is removed, and then washed with water. They then enter

the zinc phosphating chamber where a thin layer of zinc is formed that acts as a bonding and additive material. When the components are dried, they enter the powder coating facility. Here the components are powder coated with the help of electrostatic charge coating and finally sent to the oven for curing, where the paint is dried at 220 ºC. After curing the components are tested and sent to the assembly line.  Coil Winding & Horn Assembly Coil winding is said to be the critical aspect of horn manufacturing, for which the company has created a dedicated coil winding line where all the different kinds of coils are manufactured very precisely. Once the coil winding is done and the other components are painted, they travel to the assembly line, where these components are assembled according to the assembly sequence. In order to avoid mistakes, Roots Industries has made several poke yokes (mistake proofing) so that the operator is guided through sensors about which component has to go in next. If the operator misses to assemble a component, the machine stops and indicates that there is a mistake in the assembly process. To curtail rejections, the sensors even check critical components before they are assembled. If the machine senses any mistake in the component, it is placed in the non-confirmation box where it will be verified by the quality department. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.20,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1000 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 500 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.

WET WIPES MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Wet wipes, also known as wet towels, disinfecting wipes, or moist towelettes, are small, pre- moistened pieces of paper or fabric that often come folded and individually wrapped for convenience. They are mainly used for cleaning or disinfecting. Wipes can be a paper, tissue or nonwoven; they are subjected to light rubbing or friction, in order to remove dirt or liquid from the surface. Consumers want wipes to absorb, retain or release dust or liquid on demand. One of the main benefits that wipes provide is convenience – using a wipe is quicker and easier than the alternative of dispensing a liquid and using another cloth/paper towel to clean or remove the liquid. Most wipes are made of non-woven fabric similar to those used in dryer sheets. The need for these handy, cleaning wipes started when people began traveling a lot. During these trips, they realized a necessity to clean up quickly and easily without stopping at a hotel or motel.

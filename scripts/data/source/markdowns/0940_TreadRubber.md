TREAD RUBBER Introduction: The tread of a tire or track refers to the rubber on its circumference that makes contact with the road or the ground. As tires are used, the tread is worn off, limiting its effectiveness in providing traction. A worn tire can often be retreated. The tread is a thick extruded profile that surrounds the tire carcass. Tread compounds include additives to impart wear resistance and traction in addition to environmental resistance. Tread compound development is an exercise in compromise, as hard compounds have long wear characteristics but poor traction whereas soft compounds have good traction but poor wear characteristics. Advantages of Retreading of Tyres: There are several advantages of retreading such as:  Retreads are quite safe and are being used in all kind of vehicles nowadays. May it be taxis or trucks, school buses or military vehicles, retreading is being used in all of them.

 Retreading is highly environment friendly. When the existing tyres are made ready for further use, the manufactures save landfill space. Also, it reduces carbon dioxide emission and saves millions of gallons of oil which is required to manufacture new tyres. Therefore, when you get your old tyre retreaded instead of buying a new one, you play a major role in saving the precious natural resources.  Retread process is not responsible for spreading large chunks of rubber on the roads and highways. According to recent studies, it happens due to abuses like tyre failure, caused by road hazards, tyre blasts and overloading to both new tyres and retread ones.  Retreading allows tyre to perform same as a new tyre adding extra mile to your tyre life. The casing can be reused, and new treads can be added twice or thrice depending on the condition of the tyre. Tread Rubber Market Analysis & Potential: Retreading tires is the process of restoring old tires so that they can be used in automobiles. The process is technology-driven where the wornout and damaged threads are replaced with new treads. Tyre retreading can be done using 2 methods – cold process and hot process. Currently in India retreading is done 50% by the organized sector and the remaining 50% by the unorganized sector. India’s retreading industry is estimated to be worth more than US$ 1 billion (INR 5,000 crore annually) with roughly 20,000 retreaders scattered in the organised and unorganised sector.

Machinery & Equipment’s required: Name Cost Mixing Mill 6 Lac Kneader Machine 9 Lac Extruder Machine( 6 Inch) 5 Lac PCTR (Pre Cured treated rubber press) 10 Lac Machine cost will be Rs 30 Lac exclusive of GST. Value of the machine varies with the change in production capacity. Raw material requirement: The raw materials required for Tread Rubber are as follow: S No. Name Unit Price 1 Rejected rubber Kg Rs 40-60 2 Reclaim rubber Kg Rs 30 3 Chemicals Kg/Ltr. Rs 50-200 4 China Clay Kg Rs 5 On an average raw material cost per Kg for tread rubber manufactured from procured process is approx. 75-85 per Kg. Value of raw material changes as per the quality and type of Rubber. Manufacturing Process: The tyre coming from the customers is cleaned dully. Dust and mud are removed. The casing is inspected for cuts, ply section, condition of beads etc., and based on the condition of the casing, the tyre is selected or rejected. Under inflated conditions the selected tyre’s crown area is buffed to the required texture and contour. This is for better bonding of procured rubber to the casing. The buffed casing is mounted on the tread building machine. Cushion compound is applied on the buffed tread area over

which the procured tread rubber is applied and stickled using rollers. The joint portion of the procured tread rubber is stepped to avoid possible opening during curing of the tyre. The build-up of the tyre is covered by a rubber envelope and placed in the “bonder” and the bonder steam is passed at specific temperature, which cures the cushion compound to complete the bonding of the tread on the casing. Tread utilizes fresh rubber and rubber reclaimed from various rubber products; the reclaimed rubber is generally used upto 1.5% of total mass of rubber used in order to lower the overall cost as reclaimed rubber is readily vulcanized and will require none of the processes required till vulcanization & Doping, it will also add to CSR as the use of reclaimed rubber also contributes in saving environment but it cannot be used in excess as it will increase the entropy of the rubber reducing its material properties which are essential to be maintained in case of tread of tyre. The Fresh Rubber is obtained by processing Natural or Synthetic Latex (Polyisoprene + Water) which is extracted from tree or made in plant in a reactor vessel respectively; which is used as raw material in any rubber product manufacturing, the fresh latex is feed to cleansing reactor vessel in which various impurities like starch and cellulose in latex are absorbed in chemical solvents leaving behind Rubber Latex. This Rubber Latex is feed to vulcanization reactor vessel in which vulcanization is carried out. Vulcanization is process of heating rubber latex in presence of Sulphur and desired impurities in order to obtain disulphide bonding and cross-linking in elastomer which provides rubber its strength and durability. The vulcanization is performed as per application of the rubber that is being produced i.e. the impurities that are being added other than sulphur; which in this case are carbon black, accelerators, antioxidants, antiozonants, retarders, and peptizers generally. The rubber is obtained from the vulcanization reactor vessel which is a thick semi-solid material and is mixed with reclaimed rubber obtained from rubber reclamation machine, using a mixer; the rubber obtained is feed to the extruder which draws this rubber into sheets of required size by forcing it

through appropriately sized die utilizing pressure and temperature which are generated by the extruder systems as per requirement. These sheets of rubber are feed to Pre-Cured Tread Rubber Press which utilizing power press arrangement and mould, sets the rubber into the shape of treads of tyre, thus tyre treads are obtained which are checked for quality and sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

mass is then passed through rotary Kneading machine to ensure uniform distribution of ingredients in a hygienic way. Once candy mass is mixed and cooled properly it is then transferred to the batch former which rolls mixed mass into roll of appropriate size, which is then fed to the rope sizer to form a uniform rope of the required size. This rope is fed into the candy moulding machines where candies are formed in required size, shape and weight. The formed candies are discharged on the cooling conveyor, which cools them so that they may be wrapped and packed further. The formed product is wrapped by Candy Wrapping Machine and thus candies are ready to be distributed in market. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

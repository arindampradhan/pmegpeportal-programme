CAPSICUM (SWEET PEPPER / BELL PEPPER) PROCESSING INTRODUCTION Capsicum, also known as sweet pepper, bell pepper or Shimla Mirch is one of the popular vegetables grown throughout India. It is rich in Vitamin A (8493 IU), Vitamin C (283 mg) and minerals like Calcium (13.4 mg), Magnesium (14.9 mg) Phosphorus (28.3 mg) Potassium, (263.7 mg) per 100 g fresh weight. Capsicum is a cool season crop, but it can be grown round the year using protected structures where temperature and relative humidity (RH) can be manipulated. This crop requires day temperature of 25-300C and night temperature of 18-200C with relative humidity of 50-60%. If temperature exceeds 350C or falls below 120C, fruit setting is affected. King Chilli (Capsicum) is traditionally cultivated in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur and other North Eastern states of India. The chilli is called by different names in different states. In Nagaland, it is called as Naga jolokia, Naga Morish, Raja Mirchi, King Chilli. In Assam, it is mostly known as Bhutjolokia / Ghost Chilli or Bihjolokia. In Manipur the Chilli is called Umorok or Go-morok. The Bhutjolokia plant is a wondelful gift of nature as its fruit is one of the hottest chilli in the world and at the same time it possesses a pleasant and palatable aroma. Besides, King chilli possess medicinal properties which are used in the treatment of various diseases. In the recent years this king chilli is gaining importance because it has been reported as one of the hottest chilli in the world. After harvesting the chillies are to be processed immediately to avoid fungal growth. Unlike other chillies, the Bhut jolokia has a moisture level of above 85% with a very soft texture which ultimately reduces significantly the shelf life. Therefore, value added item like king chilli pickle has good prospect.

This project profile is for setting up of a King Chilli processing unit based on 300 working days per annum and 8 working hours per day. The installed production capacity of the unit per annum is as follows; King Chilli Pickle - 10 Ton Dried King Chilli - 5 Ton MARKET POTENTIAL Pickles are important part of the Indian cuisine and are consumed along with main course as well as many food preparations and snacks. They are used as taste enrichers. King Chilly pickles are popular and are consumed round the year in North East region. The Naga King Chilli is widely cultivated in north-eastern states of India predominantly in Nagaland, Assam and Manipur. There is no doubt that the Naga King Chilli, being one of the hottest chilli in the world, has enormous potential for commercialization. Even though commercialization of this particular crop has been started, it is still at a nascent stage. TECHNOLOGY & PROCESS DETAILS King Chilli Pickle: King Chillies are washed in water and would be dried in solar cabinets under the sun-light. After cutting the top and bottom portion, they are cured in brine solution for 2½ to 3 days. After that, oil, turmeric powder and other suitable ingredients (depending upon local palate) are added and mixed thoroughly and then pickle is packed in bottles and plastic pouches. The flow diagram of the process is as follows: WASHING DRYING CURING IN BRINE SOLUTION MIXING WITH INGREDIENTS PACKING/LOADING/SUPPLY Dried King Chilli: King Chillies will be dried in Solar Cabinet Dryer. Dried Chilli’s may be sold in Packets of various sizes.

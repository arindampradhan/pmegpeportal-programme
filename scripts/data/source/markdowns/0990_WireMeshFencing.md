WIRE MESH FENCING Introduction: Welded wire mesh is the latest development in land wire product industry. The welded wire, generally called reinforcing wire, is mostly used in cement concrete work for construction of buildings, National Highway pavements, runways, dams, airports etc. It is also used for fencing purposes and for partition walls and as a safety guard in engineering workshops. Market Potential: Welded wire mesh is used extensively in constructional work and fencing purposes. The wire mesh is made by automatic welding process, thus saving a lot of human labour and achieving uniformity in distance and quality. Raw Material: The only material that is used is M. S. Wire coil. Idle size of coil can be between 2mm to 5.6mm dia.

between these wires is as per design. From the machine, a cross wire over tapping the parallel wires is fed and all the joints are electrically welded. The rollers move the parallel wires further and another cross wire comes in at specified distance. The process goes on, to give a wire mesh of desired specification. The welded wire mesh is pulled out for making rolls. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 50 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 11 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

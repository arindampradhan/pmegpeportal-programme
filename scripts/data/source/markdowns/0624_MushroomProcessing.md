PROJECT PROFILE ON ‘MUSHROOM CULTIVATION & PROCESSING’ PRODUCT AND APPLICATIONS Mushroom is a nutritious vegetarian delicacy and has many varieties. It contains many vitamins and minerals but is low on sugar and fat. It can be grown in artificially created and controlled environment. It needs a temperature between 20 and 30 C and a relative humidity of 55 to 75%. It can be ideally grown in hilly areas or in in artificially controlled sheds in plains. Fresh mushrooms can be readily sold in market or processed and dried. There are two main varieties of mushroom Button type or the oysters' variety. Oyster mushrooms are easy to cultivate and process and do not require huge investment. Mushroom is and exotic and nutritious source of vegetarian diet. It is a major horticulture product all over the world. It is also becoming popular in our country. Fresh mushroom has very limited shelf life, but processed and dried mushrooms properly packed can be stored over a long period. Under the present conditions and with know‐ how developed by CFTRI it is possible to cultivate in any part of the country. The technology is available with CFTRI. Compliance with PFA Act for such a unit is essential. INDUSTRY PROFILE AND MARKET ASSESSMENT Mushroom is a vegetarian delicacy and a suitable substitute for meat and eggs. It is easily digestible. It is very popular in most of the developed countries and is being accepted in many developing countries. Market for mushroom is growing rapidly because of ots rich nutritional value and special taste aroma, flavor etc. Many exotic preparations are made from them like soup, pickles, it can be cooked in traditional

way as standard vegetable. It is also used as stuffing for various food preparations and for garnishing. Its consumption is basically confined to the urban region. It has a very short life after being harvested and are sold in fresh form. Their shelf life is enhanced by processing and properly packing in good quality polythene or proper canning. This can then be stored and transported for selling in far of markets. It is mainly consumed in hilly areas but as the nutritional awareness is increasing people from other regions are also taking it up. It is a very popular item in most of the star hotels and in urban households. Thus, there is a good market for the product in metropolitan cities and centre for tourists. The rural rich with changing lifestyle are also catching up with the urban tastes and eating habits. Processed and preserved mushrooms will ensure the availability throughout the year. It is a good substitute for standard vegetables and a good replacement for meat or eggs. The major limitation with the bulk of Green vegetables is that they are grown in a limited period only lasting for 3‐4 months and thus their availability is restricted to this period. Properly preserved packed and canned mushrooms results in it being easier to handle. This also helps in exporting the product to other countries where ever Indian cuisine is popular. It has a good demand in urban areas and metropolitan cities. Once the product establishes its Brand, export opportunities can also be explored. Middle East countries and other western countries with Indian population are places where it has demand. MANUFACTURING PROCESS & KNOW HOW PROCESS OF CULTIVATION Three aspects are to be taken care off for a successful cultivation of mushroom. These are good compost, reliable spawn and right temperature during growing period. Natural compost is prepared from horse dung and wheat or barley straw. Some quantity of chicken manure may be added. Compost preparation is very crucial. Mushrooms are grown in wooden trays or boxes. They are filled with compost and pressed firmly leaving a small space on top of the tray. The spawn is

scattered on the surface which is covered with a thin layer of compost. The trays are then covered with old newspaper and water is sprayed to provide humidity. The trays are then stacked vertically. At a temperature 24‐25 C white cottony mycelium spreads and permeate through the compost. It takes around 12 to 15 days for the complete spawn running. Ultimately the surface of the compost is covered with half to one‐inch level of casing soil. It is sterilized to kill insects. The casing soil is spread over plastic sheet and treated with formalin and stirred frequently for a week to remove formation of fumes. After casing the temperature has to be maintained at 24‐25 C for three days after which it must be lowered to 18 C. Thus, batches of trays must be arranged in such a way that there is a regular daily production. The process chart is as follows: MUSHROOM PROCESSING Fresh mushrooms have very limited life hence processing is recommended to enhance the shelf life. Initially mushrooms are washed in cold water then blanched in boiling water for 3‐4 minutes. They are then dehydrated in drier and packed. It is advisable to pre‐treat mushroom in brine solution to prevent discoloration. Packing is very crucial as formation of moisture contaminates mushroom very quickly. The yield depends on many factors as moisture content in fresh mushroom, type of drier, process employed, moisture content requires in the finished product etc. Average yield is 25%. Plain cans and brine of 2% salt and 0.2% citric acid are used for packing. The cans are vacuumed before sealing at 19 Cfor 7‐8 minutes, sealed and processed under pressure for 20‐25 minutes. The process flow chart is as under:

Know how is available with Central Government research Laboratories. The machinery is all indigenously available. The production capacity envisaged is 90 tonnes per year. It is assumed that the proportion of fresh mushrooms will be twice that of canned mushrooms. LAND AND BUILDING Land admeasuring to around 200 sq. mtrs. with built up area of 100 sq. mtrs. is adequate. (Land may cost Rs.10 lacs whereas cost of building could be Rs.12 lacs.) The cost of land and building is indicative For the sake of the project; it is presumed that the land and building is owned. PLANT & MACHINERY /CAPACITY It is advisable to undertake thorough market survey before finalizing actual capacity. Assuming capacity of 300 kgs. Per day, the annual capacity would be 90 tonnes considering 300 working days.

Packing materials like cans for processed mushrooms and plastic bags for fresh mushrooms and corrugated boxes, lables, box strappings etc. shall be required. SELLING EXPENSES Selling prices are taken on lower side as it is envisaged that the promoters would directly cater to some bulk consumers like star hotels, restaurants, clubs, caterers etc. Retailing, to some extent, will be undertaken of canned mushrooms only. Hence, selling expenses are taken at 5% of total sales value.

The canned mushrooms should conform to the specifications laid down in F. P. O 1955. The ISO 9000‐2000, HACCP, ISO‐14000 Series and European norms series standards promise a frame work which may guide the entrepreneurs towards fulfilment of a commitment of quality of products. ISO series standards are available with the Bureau of Indian Standards from their headquarters office 9 Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, N. Delhi ‐2 LABELLING AND STORAGE The cooled cans are stored in a cool dry place and smeared with grease to remove any adhering moisture from the can body to avoid rusting. Cans are kept at ambient temperature for 8‐10 days to check any swell, leakage, puffing and other disorders before labelling. Before the cans are exposed for sale, proper labelling is done to meet statutory requirements of fruit products order, 1955 Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and packed commodities (Regulation) Act 1975.

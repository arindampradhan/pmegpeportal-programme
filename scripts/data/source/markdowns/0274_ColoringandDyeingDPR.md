DUPATTA COLORING AND DYEING UNIT Introduction: Dyeing, printing, and coating are the coloration processes to produce beautiful motif and color effect on textile. Printing and coating are limited to surface coloration and may be applied to most of the fiber types, natural fabrics, and synthetics. Approximately 10,000 different dyes and pigments are used industrially around the world. Dyeing is the coloring effect throughout the cross section of fiber, and this effect can be produced on any form of textile substrate including fiber/yarn, fabric, garment, and clothing articles. However, any dyestuff is suitable for a particular type of fiber for dyeing. In the recent years, the garment dyeing has been slowly emerging as a process to meet the ephemeral fashion trends adopted by the consumers and new machines and methods have made this process to wear a brighter future for it. However, the garment dyeing is not coming without any strings attached to it; the cautions are often pronounced in terms of fabrics and their preparation, accessories used in the garments for safe operation. Along with raw stock dyeing, yarn dyeing and piece dyeing, garment dyeing has also taken its place as another form of dyeing textiles. In the case of garment dyeing, the volume of popular and unpopular colors can be increased or decreased as envisaged from the market requirements. Uses & Market Potential: Dyeing can be done during any stage in the manufacture of textile product. Textiles may be dyed as fiber, as yarn, as fabric or as garments, depending on the type of fabric or garment produced. Dyeing will occur in the most efficient stage which will meet the requirements of the intended end uses.

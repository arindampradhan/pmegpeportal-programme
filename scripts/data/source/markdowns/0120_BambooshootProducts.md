BAMBOO SHOOT PICKLE AND CANNED BAMBOO SHOOT INTRODUCTION One extensive use of bamboo is the usage of young shoots as food. Bamboo shoots are the young, edible bamboo plants that have just emerged from the ground. Bamboo shoots are low in fat and calories but rich in fibre with about 90% water. Fresh shoots have a crisp and sweet flavour with limited shelf life and have to be sold immediately. The peak availability period is June to October. The shoots are usually harvested when they attain the height of 15- 16 cm. Bamboo shoot is consumed either raw or processed because of its exotic taste and flavour. Many nutritious and active materials-such as vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants such as flavones, phenols and steroids are present in the bamboo shoots. They are valuable in pharmaceutical and food processing industries and can be processed into beverages, medicines, additives or health foods. Being a lesser-known food product, bamboo shoot processing has potential to be developed as an innovative and promising enterprise. Considering the potential market opportunity of such units, the present detail project report has been developed. The main objective of such initiative is to productively utilize the abundantly available resources of the local area and to enable uninterrupted supply of the products to market throughout the year. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The proposed project is that of setting up of a Bamboo Shoot Processing unit at suitable location. The key products of the proposed project are as follows;  Bamboo Shoot Pickle  Canned Bamboo Shoot Bamboo shoots are gaining popularity among the people all over the world.

Despite huge scope of value addition, the preparation of various bamboo shoot based products is traditional, local and unorganized. This calls for development of appropriate technologies and enterprises for preservation of bamboo shoots in different forms. It will not only address the economic and ecological aspects related to bamboo but also the food security and nutritional concerns of the region. The proposed project would procure the raw materials locally. After processing, the products would be supplied to the market through distributors/ wholesalers/retailers. MARKET PROSPECT Bamboo shoots either processed or raw, have a high demand in the markets. There is a ready market as there are very few processing units whereas demand is increasing. Apart from individual households, processed bamboo shoots have very good demand from restaurants, caterers, other caterers etc. Product can be sold through provisional stores and super markets in consumer packs and to bulk buyers in large packing. The NE region being the largest producer of bamboos in India has a bright prospect for bamboo shoot industry but presently bamboo shoot production is predominantly for fulfilling the local needs only. The local bamboo shoot industry if properly established will not only help in socioeconomic upliftment of the region but also generate huge income for the country. But effective marketing strategies should be formulated to extract maximum profits by making bamboo shoot products available to many potential customers within and outside the country. The proposed business may utilise media such as broadcast, newspapers and also social network platforms at certain interval of time to introduce the products and also attract more customers. Placement of the product at strategic outlets and publicity in local media would boost sales. It may also carry door to door services in the initial years to introduce the product and attract more customers. Marketing plan of the proposed project may include good quality maintenance, promotional campaign like offering special discounts, referrals, advertisement and tying up with buying houses.

TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS The process flow diagram is as follows: BAMBOO SHOOT PICKLE CANNING OF BAMBOO SHOOT PEELING/WASHING/SLICING PEELING/WASHING/SLICING DRYING GRADING CURING IN SALT BRINING AND DRAINING ADDING SPICES STERILIZATION MIXING WITH OIL AND VINEGAR COOLING SEALING/LABELING/PACKING SEALING/LABELING/PACKING Bamboo Shoot Pickle: Bamboo shoots Pickle processing starts with thorough washing followed by peeling off the skin, shredding, slicing and cutting into small pieces. Next, they are boiled for about 10 min to remove bitterness and unwanted matter. This is followed by storing in brine solution with 5% salt and 1% citric acid. After that, necessary ingredients and oil are added and mixed thoroughly before packaging in suitable jars. The process flow diagram is as follows: Canning of Bamboo Shoot: High moisture content of bamboo shoots makes them prone to growth of undesirable micro-organisms. Process of canning is effective in abating rancidity and preventing the growth of micro-organisms in bamboo shoots, thus preventing the products for a longer period of time. Fresh bamboo shoots are cut from head and tail. After chopping, slicing and grading, the bamboo shoots are boiled, drained and canned. Salt solution is added to the cans and is kept to evaporate. Cans are sealed and are processed through retort at a temperature of 100-21230-degree C. After cooling of cans, labelling and packing is done.

QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS The Containers made of plastic materials should conform to the following Indian Standards Specification, used as appliances or receptacles for packing or storing whether partly or wholly, food articles namely; (i) IS : 10146 (Specification for Polyethylene in contact with foodstuffs); (ii) IS : 10142 (Specification for Styrene Polymers in contact with foodstuffs); (iii) IS : 10151 (Specification for Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), in contact with foodstuffs); (iv) IS : 10910 (Specification for Polypropylene in contact with foodstuffs); (v) IS : 11434 (Specification for Ionomer Resins in contact with foodstuffs); General packaging requirements for canned products; (i) All containers shall be securely packed and sealed. (ii) The exterior of the cans shall be free from major dents, rust, perforations and seam distortions and (iii) Cans shall be free from leaks. FSSAI LICENSE: FSSAI License is issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of Family Health & Welfare, Government of India. Application to commence a food business must be made to the FSSAI in the prescribed format. Based on the application and supporting documents, FSSAI will accord approval. The Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations 2011 introduced to improve the hygiene and quality of food has brought about tremendous changes in the food industry.

However, waste water resulting from washing of ginger & lime treated ginger water may be safely dispersed over a large area of land for irrigation purpose. The promoter is advised to take "No Objection Certificate" from the State Pollution Control Board. EFFLUENT DISPOSAL: Disposal of any effluent out of the project unit should be treated with recycling facility or dumped in such a way that these does not cause hazard in the vicinity of the site. ENERGY CONSERVATION: Proper care should be taken in running the machineries and equipment to avoid over run and high electricity consumption. The machineries selected for the plant should be most energy efficient for economical production.

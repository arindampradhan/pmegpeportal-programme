PEN INDUSTRY Introduction: A pen is a tool used for writing or drawing. The ink of the pen is pressed onto paper and dries very fast. Reed pens are the oldest known type of pen. They were made from reeds growing in the delta of the Nile. The ancient Egyptians invented them, and also invented black ink, using soot and gum Arabic. Their pens had split nibs to regulate the flow of ink to the writing tip. This simple design is still used in calligraphy today. A pen is a writing instrument used to apply ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapido-graph are more commonly used. Modern types include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain and felt or ceramic tip pens. Uses & Market Potential: A pen can be used for pointing and also for gestures, simple text entry, and capturing free-form thoughts in digital ink. The pen used for input has a fine, smooth tip that supports precise pointing, writing, or drawing in ink. Pen is physically a writing instrument which

scribbles ink onto surfaces such as paper, cloth or canvas to produce a shape. It has a mechanism by which ink is made to flow through the tip of the writing instrument in the way it is scribbled onto the surface. Pen is the most important thing which a literate person possesses. The market for writing instruments in India is estimated at 1600 to 2400 million pieces a year. Out of the all instruments, ball pen market in India is very high. The total market for writing instruments is estimated at Rs 22 billion in value and is growing at around 8 to 10% annually. Major Indian players in the ballpoint pen market are Cello, Lexi, Reynolds, Luxor, Flair and so on. Out of these, Cello, Lexi and Reynolds have a major share of the market. Pen is a commodity product. Hence, price becomes an important differentiator. Price is an important attribute that influences buying decision. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Ball Pen Ink 2. Ball Pen Tip 3. Pen Caps 4. Pen Barrel 5. Front & Back cover 6. Refill Tube 7. Packing material Assuming 1 Batch of pen consists of 100 pens and the raw material cost per batch is Rs. 120-150 Machinery Requirements: Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1.

Manufacturing Process: Pen is a fundamental library instrument composed of 3 basic components Pen, Refill and Cap. Refill manufacturing is being performed and Extruder and Centrifugal Ink Filling Machine are required. The raw material for pen refill is polymer plastic which is feed to extruder via Hooper & Feeder arrangement where these granules are converted to their semi-solid state by utilizing appropriate temperature developed by the extruder followed by which this semi-solid polymer is forced through a die by extruder utilizing its plunger or screw arrangement. Die has section of refill thus a continuous refill tube is obtained from extruder die which is simply cut using a high speed cutter, followed by which ball point nibs are attached to refill, then these refills are plunged into the heads of Centrifugal Ink Filling Machine which fills these refills with ink utilizing centrifugal force. The refills are then collected and kept in their separate bins, all these part’s bins are taken to assembly area where the pen is assembled and packaged followed by their filling in cartons and sending the same for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work will cost Rs 3 Lac. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the

material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require. Implementation Schedule: S No. Activity Time required 1. Acquisition of premises 1-2 Months 2. Procurement & installation of Plant & Machinery 1-2 Months 3. Arrangement of Finance 1.5-2 Months 4.

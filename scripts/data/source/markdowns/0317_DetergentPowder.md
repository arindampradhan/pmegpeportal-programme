Introduction Synthetic detergents occupy a vital place in the present age particularly when the modern society is constantly looking for quick, effective and economic cleaning agents. Synthetic detergents emerged as a regular industry after Second World War only. The development of this industry is closely linked with Petro-chemical industry which forms the basic for its raw materials. Detergents when dissolved in water acquire better cleaning properties and hence facilitate easy removal of dirt & dust and grease etc. Apart from their use in clothes washing, detergents also have applications in the following industries. 1. In industry, in laundry and dry cleaning. 2. In textile processing, grain milling, metal plating and foods canning. 3. In dairy foods and beverages processing and in restaurants. 4. In plant maintenance and industrial house-keeping. 2

Major Application of Detergents Synthetic detergents are preferred to soaps on account of economy and efficiency. Unlike soaps synthetic detergents remain un effected by the presence of natural lime and magnesium salts in water and maintain cleaning properties in hard water with practically no wastage. Therefore these are more economical. Synthetic detergents available in the market are used for washing cloth cotton linen and other fabrics. Liquid detergents are also sold for the purpose of dish washing and cleaning floors industrial use in textiles, and commercial buildings, hospitals, and hotels, similarly railway coaches, road vehicles, aircrafts, milk bottling plants and food preservation equipment are washed with the help of detergents. Textile industry is one of the largest consumers of synthetic detergents. In the processing stage the cotton, rayon and synthetic fibers are scoured wetted with chemical detergents. They are used as dyeing and finishing operations and also in the printing trade in woolen textile industry. Detergents are used in the scouring operations of raw material, yarn and woven fabrics. In paper industry detergents are used as wetting agents to facilitate the pulp making operations. Detergents are used in degreasing of rags, in pretreatment in the electroplating and galvanizing process, for wetting of ores, and mineral extraction. In scouring of leather, detergents are employed to impart softening and penetrating properties to the leathers. In rubber industry, detergents are used as wetting and dispersing agents and as lubricants. Synthetic detergents are regularly used for cleaning equipment, packing containers employed in the food processing industry, in brewing and wine making industry. In brewing and wine making industry, the process cleaning and sterilization of vats, still and bottles is facilitated by detergents. 3

Market Potential. According to India Detergent Market Outlook, 2021, the overall market for detergent is growing with a CAGR of 13.06% from the last five years. Detergents are available in three forms, namely powder detergent, bar detergent and liquid detergent. Powder detergents are widely accepted by Indian consumers and dominate the industry. Even though detergent bars are still used in rural areas, they are fast disappearing from the market because of ineffectiveness. The detergent industry in India is mostly captured by organized players, but unorganized regional players have a significant hold on the rural areas. HUL, Rohit Surfactants, P&G, Nirma and Jyothy Laboratories are the major players in the organized market. They have popular brands like Ghari, Surf Excel, Active Wheel, Rin, Tide, Nirma, Ariel, Mr. White and Henko in their product portfolio. On the basis of pricing, the organized detergent market can be further divided into three categories, such as popular (economy), mid-range and premium. The popular category consists of brands like Ghari, Nirma and Wheel; the mid-range category consists of Tide, Rin and Mr. White; and the premium category includes Surf Excel, Henko and Ariel. Hindustan Unilever dominates the high- priced premium and mid-range category, whereas Ghari dominates the low-priced popular category. Detergent Powder Making Formula Different companies have their own customized formula. In addition, you have to craft the formula according to your target market demographic. However, a basic formula with the ingredients in percentage for ready reference is. Ingredients Premium grade (Wt, %) Popular grade (Wt, %) 85% active LAB acid slurry 18 15 Sodium carbonate (soda ash) 35 32 Sodium metasilicate 2 No Alkaline sodium silicate No 7 4

Although there are three ways of manufacturing dry detergent, only two are commonly used today. In the blender process favored by smaller companies, the ingredients are mixed in large vats before being packaged. The second commonly used method of production is called the agglomeration process. Unlike the blender process, it is continuous, which makes it the choice of very large detergent manufacturers. In the third method, dry ingredients are blended in water before being dried with hot air. Although the resulting product is of high quality, the fuel costs and engineering problems associated with venting, reheating, and reusing the air have led to this method being largely replaced by agglomeration. The blender process First, ingredients are loaded into one of two machines: a tumbling blender or a ribbon blender. The tumbling blender, shaped like a rectangular box, is turned and shaken from outside by a machine, while the ribbon blender is a cylinder fitted with blades to scrape and mix the ingredients. After the ingredients inside the blender have been mixed, a doorway at the bottom of the bowl is opened. With the blender still agitating the ingredients, the mix is allowed to run out onto a conveyor belt or other channeling device. The belt then moves the detergent to another area of the factory where it can be dropped into boxes or cartons for delivery to wholesalers or distributors. 5

The agglomeration process Shuggi agglomerator In this method, dry ingredients for a detergent are first fed into a large machine known as a (Shuggi is the manufacturer). Inside the agglomerator, sharp, whirling blades mix the material to a fine consistency; the process resembles food being textured inside a food processor. After the dry ingredients have been blended, liquid ingredients are sprayed on the dry mix through nozzles fitted into the agglomerator's walls. The blending continues, causing an exothermic (heat- producing) reaction to occur. The resulting mixture is a hot, viscous liquid similar to gelatin that hasn't hardened. Next, the liquid is allowed to flow out of the agglomerator. As it leaves the machine, it collects on a drying belt where its own heat, exposure to air, and hot air blowers render it friable—easy to crush or crumble. The newly made detergent is then pulverized and pushed through sizing screens that ensure that no large lumps of unmixed product go out to the market. The result of this process is a dry detergent made up of granules of the mixed detergent. The slurry method In this process, ingredients are dissolved in water to create a slurry. With a pump, the slurry is blown through nozzles inside the top of a cone shaped container as hot, dry air is simultaneously forced into the bottom of the cone. As the slurry dries, "beads" of dry detergent fall to the bottom of the cone, where they can be collected for packaging. Liquid detergent If the detergent is to be liquid rather than powder, it is simply mixed back in—after all ingredients are blended—with a solution consisting of water and various chemicals known as solubilizers. The solubilizers help the water and detergent blend together more fully and evenly. 6

Detail of raw material used in manufacturing of detergents. Major raw materials used in the making of detergent powder are :- Soda ash, Carboxy methyl chloride, sodium perborate, lather forming chemical, colours and perfume. Following is the utility of the given ingredients. Soda ash (Sodium c arborate ) Soda ash depresses acid bleary and makes the washing process alkaline. moreover, soda ash is a low priced salt to break the dirt. Carboxy methyl chloride (cellulose) This prevents the dirt from resettling on the surface of the cloth and is particularly useful for cotton clothes. Sodium perborate This acts as a high bleach and also retains the colours of the clothes. In addition it also breaks up the dirt particles. Perfume Perfumes and aromatic mixture are used in detergent to subside the intense smell of detergent ingredients. Major perfumes used in detergent powders are P Methoxy, P Methyle, Di-Oxide, Musk Ketone etc. Colour. Instead of white, coloured detergents are the preferred ones. Majorly, copper phthalocyamine is used for this purpose because it also blocks light and temperature. Lather producing chemical This chemical is required to produce lather and also enhances the cleaning capacity of the detergent. 7

BAJRA CLEANING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.; Poaceae) is an annual crop grown extensively in India and Africa for its grain, which is used to make flour and other foods. Millets are a group of small-seeded grasses that are commonly grown for fodder and human food as cereal crops or grains all over the world. Pearl millet is the most common crop among the millets. Cumbu is another name for pearl millet. It has the same amount of protein as wheat. A high proportion of globulin and albumin- followed prolamine can be found in the protein. The nutritional value of Bajra is unaffected by pearling since the majority of the germs are left intact to about 8% polish. Pearling improves the appearance and flavour of the food. It's usually ground into flour and used to make chapatti. It's even made into a thin porridge. There are many millet types, including the Bajra pearl millet. Other common millet varieties include fonio, finger millet (ragi), Job's tears, foxtail, and Kodo millet. 2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL The edible seeds of pearl millet plants are referred to as Bajra. They come in a range of colours, including white, yellow, grey, brown, and bluish-purple. Usually, the seeds are cooked as a cereal grain or finely ground and used as flour. Bajra is usually ground into a fine flour that is used to make roti and other flatbreads. It can also be used to make cakes and noodles, as well as a substitute for other flours in a variety of recipes. Bajra can also be eaten as a puffed millet snack, similar to popcorn. The global production of millet has been estimated at 27.8 million tons. With a 41.0 percent global market share, India is the largest global producer. The importance of millet as a food staple, particularly in India, has declined over the last two decades due to various factors, including growing incomes, increasing urbanization, and government policies. More than 50 percent of millet production, as opposed to its use only as a staple, is currently finding its way into alternative uses. Demands for food and beverage products are further driven by the increasing population, which in turn contributes to growth in the millet market in India.

RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT ➢ For Bajra processing plant the required raw material is harvested Bajra seed which is obtained after harvesting and threshing. ➢ Woven sacs are required as packaging materials. MANUFACTURING PROCESS 1. Grain delivery 2. Magnetic separator 3. Vibrating Separation 4. Aspiration 5. De-stoning 6. Disc separation 7. Colour Separator 8. Weighing Packaging YIELD OF PRODUCT/PRODUCTION RATIO The basis for calculation of production capacity is on single shift basis, with 80-90% efficiency. If 10 labours will be working for single shift basis then the total production capacity will be approx. 500 KG per hour. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities, cutting & filling area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small-scale factory setup is 1500-2000 Sq. ft. approximately.

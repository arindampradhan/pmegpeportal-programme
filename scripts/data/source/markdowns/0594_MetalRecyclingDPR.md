METAL RECYCLING UNIT Introduction: Scrap metal recycling is a process as well as being the basis for a powerful industry. Scrap metal recycling involves the recovery and processing of scrap metal from end-of-life products or structures, as well as from manufacturing scrap, so that it can be introduced as a raw material in the production of new goods. It can be recycled repeatedly with no degradation of its properties. It provides the raw material for new products, while offering a much lower carbon footprint and more efficient utilization of resources than new material. Aside from environmental benefits, metal recycling is an extremely powerful economic activity. Metal recycling has a long tradition, since people realized that it is more resource- and cost-efficient than throwing the resources away with the waste and starting all over again with mining and primary metals production. Until recently, recycling concentrated on few specific metals, mainly base metals like steel, copper or aluminum, as most products were relatively simple. Due to increasingly complex, multi- material products metal recycling in the 21st century is becoming a more challenging business. Scrap metal recycling is the process of recovering metals from products which have reached the end of the product life cycle. Scrap metal which is recovered is then introduced as raw material in the production of new goods. Scrap metals are bifurcated into ferrous and nonferrous categories. Nonferrous metals are better valued as compared to ferrous metals. Ferrous scrap has some degree of iron while nonferrous scrap does not contain iron. Nonferrous scrap contains aluminum, lead, zinc, copper etc. The recycled scrap metal finds application in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Recycling reduces rare earth metal mining activities, besides reducing waste and saving energy. Considering these factors, the scrap metal recycling market is expected to grow during the forecast period.

Uses & Market Potential: Scrap metals can be recycled repeatedly without any characteristic loss. The reuse of metals reduces the carbon footprint and helps in betterment of the environment. Scrap metal recycling and reusing helps to create a sustainable future. Scrap metal recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions. As per Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), scrap metal recycling may cut 300 to 500 million tons of greenhouse gas emission. Based on end-user industry, the market is segmented into building & construction, packaging, automotive, shipbuilding, electronics & electrical equipment and others. Building & construction was the highest revenue generating end-user industry as the sector generates high metal waste owing to increased demolition rate. However, electronics contain heavy and high valued metals, such as lead, copper, gold, and aluminum and its recycling ensures natural resources conversation. Therefore, electronics & electrical equipment industry is the fastest growing sector during the forecast period. The market has been analyzed based on four regions, namely, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA. Asia-Pacific contributed the highest revenue to the global market in 2014, and is expected to maintain it’s dominated during the forecast period. Product: METAL BARS Raw Material: Scrap Metals like aluminum, copper, steel, brass, and iron.

Manufacturing Process: Collection & Transportation Sorting Crushing and Cooling & Shredding Solidifying Melting & Separation Purification Fig. 1 – Process Flowchart Area: A closed place where your machines will operate. Place where you will put your recycled goods, place where you will segregate metals, and clean them and so on. You also need a ventilated space that matches the standard of a normal factory. Construct the infrastructure to the standards of a factory for safety issues. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small scale factory setup is 2000-2500Sq. ft. approximately.

PROJECT REPORT ON MAGNESIUM SULPHATE INTRODUCTION: Magnesium sulphate is a chemical compound containing Magnesium Sulphur & Oxygen with the formula Mg SO4. It has a tendency to absorb water from the atmosphere, so it is often found in hydrated form i.e. Mg SO4. 7H2O. Magnesium Heptahydrate, also known as Epsom Salt is the most commonly available form of Magnesium sulphate. It is an important raw material used in Pharmaceuticals. MARKET POTENTIAL: Magnesium Sulphate has a variety of uses, both in anhydrous (powder / flakes) form as well as hydrated form. The product is used in pharmaceutical industries as a purgative and has a wide market in pharmaceutical industries in different parts of the country. Some of the key medicinal values of Magnesium sulphate or Epsom salt are as under :  When used orally, it acts as a laxative. It helps the removal of undigested food present in the large intestine and by stimulating bowel movement, it acts as a remedy for constipation.  Magnesium Sulphate when administered in the veins or muscles of pregnant women, helps to delay premature labor and thereby prevent a premature birth.  Magnesium Sulphate is also used to treat severe attacks of Asthma.  Epsom salts dissolved in water and applied on the joints can give relief to joint pains of arthritic patients.  It acts as a cosmetic agent and is easily absorbed in to the skin. Thus it helps in cleanings, soothing inflammations like boils and preventing wrinkling of the skin.  Epsom salt is also good for many hair – related problems. When applied with shampoo, it absorbs the excess oil from oily hair, and adds glow and bounce to the hair. A warm mixture of Hair conditioner and Epsom salt, when used on hair is said to give it a shine.

In Agriculture & gardening, it is used to correct Magnesium deficiency. Magnesium Sulphate is used in bath salts, particularly in flotation therapy, where high concentrations raise the bath water’s specific gravity, effectively making the body more buoyant. Anhydrous Magnesium Sulphate is commonly used as a desiccant in organic synthesis due to it’s affinity to water. It may also be used as coagulant for making tofu. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: a. The estimates are drawn for a production capacity generally considered techno economically viable for model type of manufacturing activity. b. The production is based on single shift of eight hours and 300 working days per annum. c. The cost in respect of Plan & Machinery has been taken at the time of preparation of Project Profile, which may vary from place to place and time to time. d. The project is based on standard type of manufacturing activity utilizing conventional techniques of production at optimum levels of performance. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: It will take about eight months to start commercial production as under: Sr. Activity Estimated Period No. 1. Registration under MSME Act 0-1 Month 2. Preparation of scheme 0-1 Month 3. Sanction of loan 1-5 Month 4. Placement of Order for Plant & Machinery 5-6 Month 5. Power & Water Connection 5-6 Month 6. Installation of Plant & Machinery 6-7 Month 7. Procurement of Raw material & Trial Run 7-8 Month 8. Commercial Production 8th Month onwards TECHNICAL ASPECTS: a. Production Capacity :450 M. T. Per Annum b. Quality Control & Standards :As per IP Standards Physical & Chemical Properties: Appearance : Transparent Crystals or White Powder. Odor : Odorless Solubility : Soluble in water. p H : Aqueous solution is neutral or slightly acidic. Melting Point : 11240C Stability : Stable under ordinary conditions of use & storage.

MANUFACTURING METHOD : Calcined Magnetite Powder is purified mainly from iron impurities by passing it through magnetic separator. Magnesite powder is then reacted with dilute Sulphuric Acid solution. After completion of the reaction the solution is transferred to evaporator, where it is concentrated. The hot concentrated solution is then fed to Crystallizer. The crystals are then centrifuged, dried and packed. HANDLING AND STORAGE : Keep in tightly closed containers, stored in a cool, dry, ventilated area. Protect against physical damage. Isolate from incompatible substances. Containers of this material may be hazardous, when empty since they retain product residues (Dust, solids etc.). FINANCIAL ASPECTS:

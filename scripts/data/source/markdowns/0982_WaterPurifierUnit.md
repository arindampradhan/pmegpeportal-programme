WATER PURIFICATION & DISTRIBUTION UNIT Water purification is the process of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids, and gases from water. The goal is to produce water fit for specific purposes. Most water is purified and disinfected for human consumption (drinking water), but water purification may also be carried out for a variety of other purposes, including medical, pharmacological, chemical, and industrial applications. The methods used include physical processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and distillation; biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically active carbon; chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination; and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light. Water purification may reduce the concentration of particulate including suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, and fungi as well as reduce the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter. The standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments or by international standards. These standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants, depending on the intended use of the water. PH Adjustment Pure water has a p H close to 7(neither alkaline nor acidic). Sea water can have p H values that range from 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging p H

values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer and the influence of contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the p H during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifies can be an effective way to raise the p H, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Franchisee This unit is established after taking franchisee from Piramal water Pvt. Ltd. (Sarvajal). Piramal Sarvajal, seeded by the Piramal Foundation in 2008, is a mission driven social enterprise which designs and deploys innovative solutions for creating affordable access to safe drinking water in underserved areas. Sarvajal is at the forefront of developing technologies and business practices in the safe drinking water sector that are designed to make a purely market-based model sustainable in both rural and urban deployment conditions. Types of water Units 1. RO Unit 2. Water ATM: Water ATMs are automated water dispensing units, which provide communities with 24/7 safe water access. They are solar powered and cloud connected, thus enabling remote tracking of the water quality and of each pay per use transaction.

Process of water Purification 1. Aeration: Raw water is first collected in large aeration tank and the  water is aerated by bubbling compressed air through perforated pipes. Aeration removes bad odors and CO2. It also removes  metal such as iron, manganese by precipitating then as their respective hydroxides. 2. Storage or settling: Aerated water is then placed in settling tank and stored for  10-14 days. During storage about 90% of suspended solids settle down  within 24 hrs and the water becomes clear. Certain heavier toxic chemicals also settle down during  storage. Similarly pathogenic bacteria gradually die and bacterial  count decreases by 90% in first in first 5-7 days of storage.

During storage organic matter present in water is oxidized  by microorganisms. Similarly NH3 present is oxidized into nitrate by microorganisms during storage. 3. Coagulation: Water from storage tank is then placed in coagulation tank  and then some precipitating agents such as alum, lime etc are added in water and mixed. These precipitating agents form precipitate of Al(OH)3  when dissolved in water. Suspended solids absorbs on the surface of precipitate, so  gradually mass of precipitate becomes heavier and finally settle down. This technique is used to remove very light suspended  solids that do not settle by themselves during storage. Furthermore, if negatively charged colloidal impurities are present, they are neutralized by Al+++ ions and settle down. 4. Filtration: Partially clarified water is then passed through sand gravity  filter which removes 98-99% of microorganisms and other impurities. Sand gravity water filter:  Sand filter is a rectangular tank in which filter bed is  made up to 3 layers. Top layer: fine layer of 1 meter thick  Middle layer: 0.3-0.5 meter thick layer of coarse sand  Bottom layer: 0.3-0.5 meter thick layer of gravel  There is a collection tank at the bottom of the filter bed to  collect filtered water. During filtration filter bed soon gets covered with a slimy layer called vital layer. Vital layer consists of thread like algae, diatoms and  bacteria.

During filtration microorganisms presents in vital layer  oxidize organic and other matter present in water. For example if NH3 is present, it is oxidized into nitrate. Vital layer also helps in filtration of microbial cells.  If water contains unpleasant odor, activated carbon may be  placed in filter bed that removes bad odors. 5.

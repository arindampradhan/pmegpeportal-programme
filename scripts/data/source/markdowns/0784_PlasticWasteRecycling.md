PLASTIC WASTE RECYCLING INTRODUCTION Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution and water pollution. Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" hierarchy. Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, batteries, and electronics. In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material - for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used polystyrene foam into new polystyrene. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so "recycling" of many products or materials involve their reuse in producing different instead. Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value, or due to their hazardous nature.

Benefits of Plastic Waste Recycling Conservation of Energy and Natural Resources: The recycling  of plastic helps save a lot of energy and natural resources. Saving petroleum, water, and other natural resources help conserve the balance in nature. Clears Landfill Space: Waste is accumulated on land that should  be used for other purposes. The only way this waste can be removed from these areas is by recycling it. Also, various experiments have proven that when plastic waste material is thrown on the ground, it decomposes faster and emits hazardous toxic fumes after a certain period. These fumes are extremely harmful to the surrounding area as they can cause different types of lung and skin diseases. Description of plastic Waste Recycling Machine Waste recycling Machines are used to produce new materials from the waste products. With the help of this machine the work of Grinding, Dust cleaning, washing and extruding completes in a very short span. This machine is mostly used in the waste recycling industries to make different types of new raw material from plastic waste material. Plastic Waste Recycling Current Market Analysis Innovative business models such as deposit return scheme, secondary storage of EV batteries and the retail take-back for hazardous waste management, followed by disruptive applications like composite plastic separation, etc., will drive the waste recycling market in 2019. This global waste recycling and recovery market outlook study provides an overall update on the global waste recycling market in 2019, covering plastic waste. This research predicts that the global market revenue is set to increase from $354.7 billion in 2018 to $376.9 billion in 2019. There are some ISO standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste.

Process of Plastic Waste Recycling Before any plastic waste is recycled, it needs to go through five different stages so that it can be further used for making various types of products. Sorting: It is necessary that every item is separated according to  its make and type so that it can be processed accordingly in the machine. Shredding: After sorting, the plastic waste is loaded into different  conveyer belts that run the waste through the different shredders. These shredders tear up the plastic into small pellets, preparing them for recycling into other products. Grinding: Next step in the waste recycling process is grinding.  Grinder is used to remove waste material from the small pellets plastic. Dust Cleaning: After grinding, the plastic waste is cleaned to  remove the dust from the poly bags. This process is not required for hard plastic. Conveyer washing: In this process, the material is washed in  clean water for few minutes. Drum Washing: Now the material is washed after conveyer  washing. For this a round shape drum is used for washing the material in the plant. Dryer: In this process dryer/ Hydro is used to dry the material  came from the washing drum. Agglomeration process: In this step mixing of the material is  done for few minutes. For Hard plastic agglo-process machine is used (For example: Bucket, Mugs etc.) & for soft plastic normal machine is used (For example: Poly Bags etc.) Extruding/Recycling Machine: This involves melting the washed  plastic so that it can be extruded into small pellets, which can be used as a raw material for different types of plastic products. Production depends on material. If the material is hard then production is more and vice-versa (Range = 90-125 KG). Now the product is ready to sell in the market.

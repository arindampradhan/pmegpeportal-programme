PROJECT REPORT ON ‘ICE CREAM’ INTRODUCTION: Ice Cream is a popular food product. It was considered as a luxury food for summer season only. However, with the development of Dairy and Milk processing industry it has also found use as a Dessert. The Bureau of Indian Standards have formulated IS2802:1964 for performed Ice Cream and IS5839:1970 for hygienic conditions for manufacture, storage and sale of Perfumed Ice Cream. Average Ice Cream and Premium Ice Cream differ in solid content as below: Sl. No. Ingredient Content as percent in Average Ice Cream Premium Ice Cream 1. Milk Fat 10.5% 16.0% 2. Non Fat Milk solids 11.0% 9,0% 3. Sucrose 12.5% 16.0% 4. Corn syrup 5.5% - 5. Stabilizers 0.3% 0.1% 6. Emulsifier 0.1% - Total solids 39.9% 41.1% One hundred grams of Ice Cream contain more than 200 calories and 4% protein, besides Minerals and Vitamins.

MARKET: Ice Cream is consumed as Dessert as well as anytime snacks. Its demand peak in Summer months. Railways are the most important bulk consumer of Ice Cream. Hotels, Restaurants, Resorts and flight kitchens are other bulk consumers. Sales through vendors and shops attract other consumers the most. Street vendors find good market for Ice Creams among school children. Ice cream is consumed both as Dessert and as anytime snacks, street vendors find excellent market for Ice Cream among school children. Brand consciousness in rural and semi urban areas is comparatively less and hence local Brands sells well. Bulk consumption of Ice Cream in hotels, Restaurants, etc. is by far less than national average. CAPACITY: The Unit shall single shift of eight hours per day for three hundred working days per annum. Accordingly it will have an annual installed capacity to produce 75,000 kgs of Ice Cream per annum. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE: the process suggested here is the one tested and practiced all over India. Milk shall be pasteurized in Steam- Jacketed SS Vessel. Milk, Cream, Butter and Sugar in exact quantities shall be mixed in a SS Homogenizer. The Mix shall be Pasteurized again. Emulsifiers and Stabilizers shall be added to the mix and blended. This mix is further homogenized so that the globule sizes are 4 microns or less. The mixture is cooled again and kept cool for at least 24 hours at 4degree C to 0degree C. Flavors and colours are added prior to cooling. The mixture is cooled again below 0degree C for hardening in a Batch Freezer. Ice Cream is packed in small cups and as cones with Wooden/Bamboo handles. For cups and cubes the above process suffice. For cones the Ice Cream is placed inside moulds with the handle for deep freezing. Such cones are packed in Plastic/Paper packets. Ice Cream in Cups and Cones shall be vended in Cooled Hand Carts by authorized vendors in and around towns. Vendors are given 35% of sales realization as Commission and they work for the Commission only. Basic steps in the manufacturing of ice cream are generally as follows:  Blending of the mix ingredients  Pasteurization  Homogenization  Aging the mix  Freezing  Packaging  Hardening PROCESS FLOW:

Printed Ice Cream cups, paper cover and sticks shall be bulk purchased from outside the state and these packing materials shall be stored for 3 months. Milk shall be stored for one day only. Other raw-materials shall be stored for a week. FSSAI LICENSE: FSSAI License is issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of Family Health & Welfare, Government of India. Application to commence a food business must be made to the FSSAI in the prescribed format. Based on the application and supporting documents, FSSAI will accord approval.

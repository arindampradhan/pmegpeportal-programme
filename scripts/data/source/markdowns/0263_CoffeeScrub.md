1. INTRODUCTION Coffee scrub is an outstanding way to improve the health and appearance of your skin, not only of the face, but of the body as well. Coffee scrub contains coarse coffee grounds, which slough away dead skin cells and dirt while unclogging the pores. The caffeine present in coffee beans stimulates blood flow to the skin. Increased blood flow to the skin helps to speed up the skin’s natural process of renewal, allowing for quicker delivery of nutrients to the cells. Coffee Scrub can slow the ageing process of your skin and this is extremely useful especially for the body, which tends to be overlooked in our skincare routines. Coffee scrubs exfoliate the skin, remove dead skin cells, and may even help reduce cellulite. Caffeine may help reduce cellulite and dimples on the skin. Another benefit of using coffee on your skin is that coffee is high in antioxidants, which are amazing for your skin. Scrubbing the face with coffee grounds can help to clear away dead skin cells and unclog the pores. The chlorogenic acids in coffee may also reduce inflammation and protect against some strains of bacteria. The sand-like texture of coffee grounds makes a great exfoliant in homemade scrubs. The grounds work to gently remove dead skin cells, which helps to rejuvenate and boost circulation.

general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses.  Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Coffee scrub  Grinding of Coffee ingredient: The proper grinding of the coffee needed to obtained the required input scrub unit. Small changes in grind size can drastically affect the smoothness of the final product.  Mixing of coffee scrub with coconut oil: The coffee fine grain and coconut should be mixing and ramming properly so that the property of scrub can be achieved.  Mixing of sugar with coffee compound: When sugar is added to coffee, the distribution of the caffeine molecules change. The sugar molecules bind to the water molecules. The caffeine molecules react by clustering together and prepare a scrub component. The sugar becomes evenly distributed throughout the solution, so that one portion is not sweeter than another. The dissolved portion of the solution is called the solute (sugar) and the dissolving portion is the solvent. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 3000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 to 40,000 per month. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project.

3.2 Plant & Machinery This is a semi-automatic type of plant and the production capacity is set to be 80 Kg Coffee Scrub per day. Machines-  Coffee Grinder: This machine is a grinder machine by using coffee partially coffee grain can be formed. The size of the coffee grain can be partially moderate so that a good coffee material is obtained after Grinder Machine.

 Mixing Jar (Coffee grain, Coconut oil &Sugar): The three-ingredients, used in making of coffee scrub pour in the mixing jar for proper mixing. The ratio can partially change according to the manufacturer as per the prescribed standards. The coconut oil is used as per its fatty acids profile. Uniform mixing of the three ingredients increases the product quality.  Automatic packaging machine: Packaging machines are used to package the coffee scrub. This product area includes equipment that forms, fills, seals, wraps, cleans, and packages at different levels of automation. Packaging machines also include related machinery for sorting, counting, and accumulating.

R. C. C. Spun Pipe INTRODUCTION Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) Spun / Hume Pipes are generally used for water drainage,sewerage,culverts and irrigation. RCC Pipes are very much preferred for such usage because they are leak proof, are easily repairable and are non‐reactive to sewerage toxins. Concrete Pipes has been estimated to easily last around 100 years and as such they are fit and forget solution which is why they are preferred over other materials for such usage. Reinforced cement concrete spun pipes upto 1000 mm dia are exclusively reserved for manufacture in the MSME sector. RCC Spun Pipes are classified as pressure and non‐pressure pipes. viz NP1, NP2, NP3, P1, P2, P3 for use in specific conditions. RCC Hume Pipes are made from cement, coarse and fine aggregate, sand, mild steel and HT Rods and bars. RCC Spun/Hume Pipes have been used around the world since 1926. RCC Hume Pipe,so called because it was developed by Sir Walter Hume from Australia in 1910. RCC Hume Pipes (Also known as Spun Pipes) are used for sewerage, drainage, culverts, irrigation, water supply / transportation, service lines etc. MARKET POTENTIAL Public Health Engineering Department, Public Works Departments, Agriculture and Forest Department, National Highways, Environment Engineering Department, Panchayats Municipal Corporations are the bulk consumers of RCC spun pipes. Most of the customers are approved civil contractors who are executing the works of the Government Department and Public Sector Undertakings. Presently government is giving stress on rural irrigation and improving methods of water supply scheme, so the demand for pipes is increasing. TECHNICAL ASPECTS PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE Mixture: According to mix design and regular checking aggregates, water and Cement are used by weight. Instructions are written on boards for proper mixtures. Instructions are given to consume mixture within 30 minutes for its proper strength. IS 456 is followed for this. The concrete mixture for the RCC spun pipe is prepared in proportion of 1:2:5:2:5 of cement stone, metal and sand respectively Molding: All moulds are properly cleaned from Hand Grinder after opening. Proper supports are given for centering of cages. (If it is higher dia 2 cages are made as per IS:

## Page 4

458 and upper cage is always 75% of inner cage) Proper oiling is done on moulds as well as on bushes and rings. These are properly packed with tie rods and nut‐bolts. Manufacturing: The reinforced cage is first prepared on the cage‐winding machine by hand process. The cage is then placed inside the pipe mould which is then hoisted up and mounted horizontally on the turn unions. After molding, moulds are properly kept on runners with the help of Chain Pulleys. Initially while pouring the mixture RPM of machine is very slow for proper pouring and then RPM are up to 1500 as per the requirement of IS: 458. When the proper spinning is done it leaves extra water which gives the strength to the pipe. It is rotated by driving shaft with variable speed arrangement, the rotation is kept slow in the beginning and then the speed is increased. The cement concrete is fed into the moulds during rotation which spreads inside evenly. The time required for completion of this operation depends upon the diameter and class of the pipe. The pipes are kept in the mould for 24 hours. On the following day the pipes are removed from the moulds and submersed in water in the curing tank for about 15‐20 days depending upon the class of the pipe. The specimens of the pipes are subject to the following tests viz: (1) Hydrostatic pressure test (2) Three edge bearing test (3) Absorption test. After it, finishing of pipes is done by cutting from rods and brushes. Demolding: While demolding, with the help of Chain pulleys moulds are separated. Moulds are demoulded after 24 hours for proper quality of pipes. Marking: After manufacturing process, all pipes are marked and dated from permanent marker. Supervisor record all these marked numbers in front of tagged numbers and afterwards these are stored in Computer by date and marked number wise with the weight of cages. Curing: After Demoulding with the help of Trolleys, Hydra and ceilings pipes are kept in curing tanks for proper curing. Rotation of pipes is done daily and 24 hours Sprinklers are on. After 28 days curing pipes are taken out from tanks and storage is done. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS The Bureau of Indian Standards has formulated IS 458:1971, for maintaining Quality of the product. PRODUCTION CAPACITY (PER YEAR) Quantity 20,000 Running meter Motive Power 20k W.

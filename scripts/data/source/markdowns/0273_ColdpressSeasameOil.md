COLD WOOD PRESSED SESAME OIL PLANT Introduction Sesame oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from sesame seeds. Besides being used as a cooking oil, it is used as a flavor enhancer in many cuisines, having a distinctive nutty aroma and taste. The oil is one of the earliest-known crop-based oils. Worldwide mass modern production is limited due to the inefficient manual harvesting process required to extract the oil. It is also known as ‘TIL’ oil. It’s commonly used in cooking, just like vegetable oil and olive oil. Benefits of Cold pressed Sesame Oil  Sesame oil contains sesamol and sesaminol, two antioxidants that may have powerful effects on your health.  Sesame oil comprises 82% unsaturated fatty acids, which is good fro health.  Sesame oil may even play a role in long-term blood sugar regulation.  sesame oil to improvements in arthritis  Sesame oil reduced burn and wound healing time in mice.  May improve sleep quality  Massage with sesame oil may help reduce arm and leg pain

Product & its application There are many variations in the colour of sesame oil: cold-pressed sesame oil is pale yellow, while Indian sesame oil (gingelly or til oil) is golden, and East Asian sesame oils are commonly a dark brown colour. Cold-pressed sesame oil has a different flavour than the toasted oil, since it is produced directly from raw, rather than toasted, seeds. Uses of Sesame Cake (By-product) Sesame oil meal (or sesame oil cake) is the protein-rich by-product obtained after oil extraction. Depending on the way oil has been extracted, sesame oil meal can be food grade (from dehulled sesame seeds), or used as a feed for livestock, especially ruminants and poultry. Raw Material Sesame seeds is used as basic raw material for Cold Pressed Sesame Oil plant & jiggery is added in the sesame seeds to extract the sesame oil. Traditionally, jaggery is added to extracted gingelly oil to maintain the balance in taste. Cold Pressed Sesame Oil Market Analysis Based on the distribution channel, global sesame oil market is segmented as direct sales, online retail, supermarkets/hypermarkets, and specialty stores including natural food and cosmetic stores. Among which, sales through the Internet is expected to grow which is due to the increasing popularity of the seed oils such as sesame, argan and flaxseed oil on social media. Due to its nutritional value, people often pick sesame seed oil rather than any other oil for consumption and application. The Sesame oil industry in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% during the forecasted period of 2017-2022.

Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for manufacturing of Cold Pressed Sesame Oil:  Wood press Ghani Machine  5 HP Motor  Filter Machine  Other equipment’s: Storage tank Processing Sesame oil is extracted from sesame seeds. The oil contains polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, and is low in saturated fats. Sesame oil is rich in magnesium, zinc, calcium, thiamin, iron, manganese, vitamin E and is loaded with B-complex vitamins. These nutrients provide immense health benefits. The yellow coloured oil extracted from the seeds of sesame has been extensively used as a healing oil since many years. The oil has a nutty flavor and is rich in nutrients, hence it serves a good cooking oil for many dishes Apart from cooking, it are also used for cosmetic purposes, especially on skin. Manufacturing Process  Take the raw material (Sesame seeds and Jaggery) & put it into the Ghani machine hopper.  After that start the machine & process of crushing the material will start. It requires manual manpower to operate the machine as well as for the crushing process.  It takes time to manually crush the material through cold press and the generation of oil from it.  Next step is to collect the oil from the machine kept it open for some time to cool & after that put it into the filter machine for the filtering process.  After filtering of oil, product is ready for packaging. One round of Sesame Oil production takes 45 minutes for completion of production process. Maximum 10 completed Rounds of Sesame Oil production can be done in a shift of 8 hours a day. Normally Sesame oil is generated at 45-50% of raw material.

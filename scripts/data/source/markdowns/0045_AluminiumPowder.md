ALUMINIUM POWDER Introduction: Aluminium powder is a fine granular powder made from Aluminium. In form of powders, Aluminium is used for several applications such as manufacture of slurry, explosive and detonators, thermit process used for manufacture of ferro alloys and for specialised welding applications such as rails, pyrotechnic to manufacture crackers, sparkles and other pyrotechnic products; manufacture of aluminium paste, paints and several powder components used in automobiles. The most important property of aluminium powder to undergo a vigorous exothermic reaction when it gets oxidised finds application in pyrotechnic process. In foundry, aluminium powder is used as a deoxidant and exothermic tapping compounds to increase the yield of casting. Market Potential: The aluminium powder is a consumable product. Presently there are four major organised manufacturers of aluminium powder. They are Metal Powder Company, Thirumangalam,INDAL, Mumbai, Khosla Metal Powder Company, Pune and Arasan Aluminium Industries, Sivakasi. In addition, there are a number of small scale industries located in Karnataka, M. P., Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi with an installed capacity of 1 tonne per day. In a recent report of DSIR, the total production of aluminium powder in the country has been estimated at more than 10,000 MT per year. DGTD has estimated the growth of demand between 8 to 10% per annum. In

conclusion, it can be said that production of aluminium powders of various grades and products such as aluminium paste is well established in the country. The aluminium powder industry is of a remarkable size. There is a growing market for export of aluminium powder and paste. Good opportunities exist in the field of setting up new units in small scale sectors with proven technology and appropriate quality orientation. Raw material: The only raw material that is used to manufacture aluminium powder is Aluminium Ingots. Machinery Requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Description Qty. Amount 1. Oil Fired Furnace-250 Kg 1 300000 2. Ball Mill Capacity- 50 Ltr 1 200000 3. Compressor 1 75000 4. Hot Air chamber 1 175000 5. Powder collecting duct complete 1 150000 with suction arrangements etc. 6. Oil Tanker 1 50000 7. Water Cooling Tank, pumps Ls 50000 8. Weighing Platform- 500 Kg Cap. 1 150000 9. Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 1200000 Manufacturing Process: The aluminium powder is manufactured in several forms such as flake-like particles, granular powder (atomised aluminium) etc. For the production of aluminium powder, there are several processes, one can use any of them. The metal is melted in furnaces and the temperature maintained is around 720°C to 760°C. Atomised Aluminium is produced by blasting the stream of molten Aluminium into small particles by air jet. For this purpose, an atomiser is used which consists of a straight tube

with lower end dipped in molten metal and upper end terminating as a small orifice. A jet of hot air under pressure is passed through armular opening near the top which impinges on a stream of molten Aluminium drawn by suction through the orifice. This leads to the formation of small particles of Aluminium. These particles are drawn by suction, through a collecting duct placed above the nozzle and finally into a cyclone collecting system. The particle size can be controlled to some extent by varying nozzle opening air pressure etc. The different sizes of Aluminium powders are segregated by sieving. Then packing is done as per market requirement for specific quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

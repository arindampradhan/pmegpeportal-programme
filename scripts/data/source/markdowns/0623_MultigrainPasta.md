MULTIGRAIN PASTA MAKING UNIT Introduction: Pasta is a generally loved delicacy, with a variety of noodle dishes available in almost every country. Pasta is a popular cuisine that found in most households, restaurants, and institutional settings. Wheat flour, semolina, starch, vegetable oils, various spices, Sodium Bicarbonate, and other basic raw materials are required. Whole-grain wheat flour contains both anatomic components of the grain, including endosperm, bran, and germ, in the same proportions as intact shape. The use of pasta products, particularly noodles, is continuously expanding in India. Pasta products are becoming more popular since they are easy to create, inexpensive, and can be stored after drying for longer periods of time without losing quality. Pasta has the advantage of slowly releasing glucose, which the body requires as it progresses. Even though individuals are concerned about their health, they do not have the time to ingest each grain one by one. As a result, there is a greater demand for multigrain products that provide nutritious benefits from all of the grains utilized in their formulation. People can profit from the manufacture of designed foods with high protein and fiber content, such as pasta. Even if people are worried about their health, they do not have time to eat each grain individually.

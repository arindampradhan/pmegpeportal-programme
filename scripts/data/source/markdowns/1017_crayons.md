1. INTRODUCTION Crayola brand crayons were the first kids' crayons ever made, invented by cousins, Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith. The brand's first box of eight Crayola crayons made its debut in 1903. A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing. Wax crayons differ from pastels in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic, and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil. Crayons are available in a range of prices, and are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists. The crayon changed the way children grow. Crayon not only used for coloring but the crayon has also sparked the creation of new and alternative forms of art and promoted early development in children. The crayon has drastically evolved color and has helped enable psychological analysis. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  Crayons are used by professional artist to create colourful, vibrant, realistic, and whimsical pieces of art.  Crayon colour are used for the manufacturing of colourful candle by melting in a candle mould.

 Crayon colour are used to get the impressed design on the cotton/fabric clothes.  Crayon colour are used by kid children for drawing & writing purpose. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- Raw material procurement Production Process Raw Material Procurement Procurement is the connection process of purchasing and arranging in bound movement of all items, supplies, materials, parts, finished inventory and general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses. Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Crayons  Storage of hot paraffin (Wax): The storage of the hot paraffin (Wax) is the initial step of manufacturing of Crayons in crayon making plant.  Preparation of colour pigment: The process either use individual colours or mix the pigments to produce the many colours of Crayola Crayons.  Mixing of wax and colour pigment: The liquid wax mixed properly with the powder form of colour pigment along with some white additive to improve the crayons quality.  Hot, waxy liquid is poured into crayon moulding tables: The mixing of wax and pigment injected into crayon mould and solidification take place.  Cooling of the moulding table: Cold water travels through tubes in the molds to cool the wax down.

 Removal of extra metal: The extra metal inserted on the surface during cooling process can be removed by scraper.  Labelling and packaging of finished product: The labelling & packaging process required to maintain the quality of Crayons colour. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 600 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.10,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.200 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 200 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 100 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Mixing chamber machine, the mixing chamber machine are used for proper mixing of liquid wax with powder colour pigment to get the required input raw material for colour moulding process.

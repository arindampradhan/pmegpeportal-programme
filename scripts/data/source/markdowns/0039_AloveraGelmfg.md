Manufacturing Process: Fig. 1 – Process Flowchart The fresh harvested aloe Vera leaves are procured from the local farmer. The timing of the process is important part as leaves show losses of biological activity;beginning at six hours following harvest whenthe leaves are stored at ambient temperature. In the first step, the leaves are fed into washing unit to

remove dirt, farm yard waste, aloin content from the leaves. This is a 4 stage washing process. At first stage, water is filled inside steel tanks from pump and leaves are allowed to soak the water for 90 minutes. Along with the soaking in water dirt is removed by brush from the surface of leaves manually by hand or brush. In second stage, the leaves are fed into wash tank filled with mineral water. The mineral water used for cleaning is UV filtered and ozone treated. Calcium hypochlorite is also added in the water of about 0.1 % w/v for disinfection. All the leaves were carefully observed and any infected or damaged leaves were immediately discarded at thisstage. In third stage the aloe vera leaves were again cut at about 1½ inch from the apex. The leaves were then cut in to two or more parts longitudinally, which were easy to handle are cleaned in agitated water. After this, in fourth stage the leaves are cleaned in hot water at 50 ℃ temperature for 30 minutes. At this stage the total aloin content is removed from leaves. Water heater is used to heat the water. After this, the sides of the leaves are cut by ½ inch manually using knives. In the next step, Aloe vera leaves are fed into Aloe Vera leaf extractor to remove the upper and lower layer of the leaves to produce fresh gel. After this, the fresh gel is fed into juicer to that grinds the gel to produce juice. The juice obtained is fed into storage tanks through pumps. In the next step, the juice is heated to 50 -70 ℃ temperature and pectolytic enzyme is added into the juice in an amount of 0.06 % w/v. Second class preservatives are also added at this stage. Heating is done for 20 – 25 minutes. After this, the Aloe Vera juice is stored in tank for 12 hours to reduce the viscosity of the juice. After this, juice is filtered to remove foreign materials. In the next step, the aloe vera juice is filled inside storage tanks. From the storage tanks the juice is transferred into homogenizer with the help of pump. Caropol (2% by wt.) and Aristroflex (1% by wt.) are added inside the aloe vera

juice and rotated uniformly at high rpm. The mixture is thoroughly stirred for 45 to 60 minutes till fine emulsion of gel is not formed. In the next step, bottles are washed using heated mineral water and dried properly. The gel is filled inside the bottle using filling machine in desired quantity. After this, the bottles are packed and dispatched as per required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1200Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 2 Lac Rs.(Approx.) Machines: 1. Aloe Vera Washing Unit – This unit is contains tanks filled with cold and hot water to thoroughly wash the harvested leaves of Aloe Vera.

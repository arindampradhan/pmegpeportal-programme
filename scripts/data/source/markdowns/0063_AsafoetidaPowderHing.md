ASAFOETIDA POWDER MANUFACTURING Introduction: Asafoetida, also spelled asafetida, gets its name from the Persian aza, for mastic or resin, and the Latin foetidus, for stinking. It is a gum that is from the sap of the roots and stem of the ferula species, a giant fennel that exudes a vile odour. In its pure form, it is sold in the form of chunks of resin. The odor of the pure resin is so strong that the pungent smell will be absorbed by other spices and substances stored nearby. Hence, Asafetida has to be stores in an airtight container. Many commercial preparations of Asafetida use the resin ground up and mixed with a larger volume of other neutral edible ingredients, such as wheat flour, rice flour and turmeric. The mixture is sold in sealed plastic containers with a hole that allows direct dusting of the powder. Uses & Market Potential: This spice is used as a digestive aid, in food as a condiment, and in pickling. It plays a critical flavoring role in Indian vegetarian cuisine by acting as a savory enhancer. Used along with turmeric, it is a standard component of lentil curries, such as dal, curries, and vegetable dishes, especially those based on potato and cauliflower. Asafoetida is used in vegetarian Punjabi and South Indian cuisine where it enhances the flavor of numerous dishes, where it is quickly heated in hot oil before sprinkling on the food. The spice is added to the food at the time of tempering. Sometimes dried

The bottles are filled manually by opening the knob of the tank with asafoetida powder blend followed by their capping, each bottle is weighed to ensure required weight; passed through a metal detector to ensure no metal burs or chips are present in powder as grinding and blending process is involved. The bottles are then simply packed in cartons and sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1400Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs.(Approx.)

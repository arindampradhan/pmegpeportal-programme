CHOCOLATE MILK MAKING UNIT Introduction: Chocolate milk is a milk typically flavored with cocoa and sugar. Milk is considered a complete protein — meaning it provides all nine essential amino acids your body needs. Milk naturally contains a type of sugar called lactose. Chocolate milk also contains added sugar in the form of sucrose. Chocolate milk, whether served hot or cold, is more than just a favorite drink that many people have loved since childhood. It’s also a great source of several important nutrients. Nutrient-rich chocolate milk can help you refuel and rehydrate within the critical 30-minute recovery window after exercise. It contains a combination of carbohydrates and protein to refuel and repair muscles, fluids to rehydrate, and electrolytes to replenish what is lost in sweat. It has the added bonus of bone-building nutrients, like calcium, to help maintain strong bones and prevent stress fractures. The essential nutrients in chocolate milk: Promote normal blood pressure (calcium)  Help convert food into energy (riboflavin and niacin)   Help build and maintain lean muscle (protein)

Uses & Market Potential: Chocolate milk is rich in protein, which helps build muscle mass. Several studies have also found that drinking chocolate milk significantly increases endurance, which helps you keep exercising longer. Chocolate Milk can also replace regular milk in any dessert-inspired drink, featuring other sweet ingredients like bananas and peanut butter. The global chocolate milk market was valued at USD 7,784.41 million in 2020, and it is projected to register a CAGR of 4.67% during the forecast period (2021-2026). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the generation of opportunities for many dairy snack food and beverage private players to emerge in the markets to cater to the inflated demand. The demand for innovative dairy products, including chocolate milk products, is consistently high in the developed countries, as these beverage snacks are a quick and convenient source of nutrition and energy. The global chocolate milk market is segmented by type into dairy-based chocolate milk and non-dairy-based chocolate milk. With some good benefits of chocolate milk for all age groups the demand is increasing for the product in urban as well as in rural areas. Product: Chocolate Milk

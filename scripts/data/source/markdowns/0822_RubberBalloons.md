PROJECT REPORT ON RUBBER BALLOONS Introduction: Rubber balloons are thin gauge rubber products produced from suitable latex compound. It is considered as cheapest of all toys and hence it is extremely popular in all segments of population. Toy balloons have no formal specification. Toy Rubber Balloons are perhaps the most popular toy of children. As it is made primarily with Natural Rubber latex it is a resource-based industry Market: Toy Rubber balloons are not only the most popular toy of children; it is also used in Birth-day celebrations, decoration of shops & restaurants. It is also used for target –practice and decorations to show festivities. Thus from demand aspect also Toy Rubber Balloons have good scope. Installed Capacity: Operating single shift of 8 hours per day for 300 working days per annum the unit shall have an installed capacity to produce 1,80,000 packets of 100 balloons each per annum. Suggested Capacity: The minimum economic capacity of a unit manufacturing balloons is 1 million pcs. Per annum based on 30 days working schedule in a year. Raw Materials: 97.32 percent of Rubber balloon comprise of Ammonia reduced Latex. Casein, Potasium hydroxide, Sulphur, Zinc oxide, colour pigments and chemicals like vulcanax SP, Vulkacit LDA forms the remaining 2.68 percent of raw materials. Rubber- chemicals are available from ICI (India) Pvt. Ltd. Gesent House, Bollard Estate, Mumbai-1 and Munsanto chemicals of Indian (P)Ltd; Vakefield House, Sprott Road, Mumbai Latex is available locally.

Process of Manufacture: Although rubber can be made synthetically, natural latex is preferred for its great elasticity. It can be stretched to seven or eight times its original length and still return to its former shape. Synthetic rubber has not proven to be as elastic and resilient as natural latex. Raw, natural latex is a white or yellowish opaque liquid, similar in appearance to milk. Latex must be mixed with additives before it can be used in industrial processes. Certain chemicals are mixed in to achieve a desired thickness, rate of drying, and other properties. Other chemicals (collectively known as antidegradants) are added to slow the oxidation and decomposition of the rubber. To give it color, pigments are mixed into the latex. The pigments may be fine metal oxide powders or organic dyes. Process Flow Ammonia Reduction in latex Dipping Compounding of Latex Mix Preparation of emulsion of chemicals Sales Packing Vulcanizing By blowing air and reacting the latex with formaldehyde the Ammonia content of Latex is reduced to about 0.1 percent. In this latex casein, Polassium hydroxide, Vulkanox SP, Sulphur, Vulkacit LDA, Zinc Oxide, Colour pigments, etc. are added. Moulds or formers are dipped in this latex compound. Formed balloons are vulcanized is a hot- air-oven. Balloons are then slupped off formers. Balloons are then packed in polythene bags manually for sales.

QUALITY CONTROL The balloon manufacturing environment must be strictly controlled in order to achieve high quality and consistency. Throughout the manufacturing process, computer- based instrumentation records and controls air humidity, air temperature, latex tank temperature, the temperature in the ovens, dryers, and other parameters. The latex and other chemicals used in the process must be carefully formulated for specific properties, and carefully maintained. For example, the latex must have certain viscosity and speed of drying. The tanks in which it is held must have devices to keep the latex circulating to avoid forming a "skin," and to prevent ingredients from settling. BYPRODUCTS/WASTE It is in the manufacturers' best interests to waste as little rubber as possible because the cost of latex is high compared to the selling price of individual balloons. Balloon makers also reclaim much of the coagulant that ends up in the leaching solution. Unfortunately, what is not reclaimed ends up as liquid waste in the environment. The amount of chemical waste that can be released by a factory is regulated by government laws. Balloons also result in some waste after they are manufactured because they are invariably thrown away after they deflate or pop. However, because latex is natural, it eventually breaks down into other substances. Toy balloons can be a source of joy, but they can also be unexpectedly hazardous. Young children have been known to die from accidentally choking on balloons

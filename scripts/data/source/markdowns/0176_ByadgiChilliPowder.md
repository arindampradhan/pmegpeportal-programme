BYADGI CHILLI POWDER UNIT Introduction: The Byadgi (or Byadagi) chilli is a well-known chilli variety grown in Karnataka. It is named after Byadgi, the Taluk (tehsil) headquarters in the Karnataka district of Haveri. The Byadagi chilli is a long (12-15 cm) and small, bright red variety of chilli with wrinkled pods. The fragrance and deep red colour of Byadgi chillies are well-known. The highest colour values are found in Bydagi chillies, which range from 150000 to 250000 CU (Colour Units) or 80-130 ASTA colour units. The pungency of Bydagi chillies is mild, and the seed content is moderate. Byadgi chillies have a capsaicin content ranging from 0.8 to 1.3 percent, and their pungency ranges from 8000 to 15000 SHU (Scoville Heat Units). Byadgi chillies have been designated as a Karnataka Geographical Indication (GI application No. 129) commodity. In Karnataka, the Bydagi chilli is cultivated in the rainfed districts of Dharwad, Gadag, and Haveri. Chilli yields in these districts range from 0.5 to 1.25 MT/ha. Other districts where Guntur variety chillies were previously cultivated, such as Bellary, Raichur, and Gulbarga, have switched to growing Byadgi variety chillies, which have a higher oleoresin content and an optimum yield of 3.75-5.00 MT/ha. It is grown in the districts of Karnool and Adhoni in the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh. In cuisine, Byadgi chilli is often used as a ground spice powder. Byadgi chilli is preferred in the manufacture of pickles, masala products, and chilli powder because it helps them to obtain the best colour naturally while preventing their products being too pungent for use. Because of its bright red colour, the Byadgi chilli is also useful as a colouring agent. Byadgi chilli is commonly used in the extraction of oleoresin, a form of oil.

Uses & Market Potential: Dry chilli farming is more lucrative than green chilli farming because there is still a strong market demand for it. Producers will make a lot of money from it. Byadgi chillies are typically sold in gunny bags weighing 30-40 kg. Chilies are dried and processed in gunny bags by growers. Dried Byadgi chillies are available in a variety of types in the market, including Byadgi chillies with stems, Byadgi chillies without stems, crushed dried red chilli flakes, and dried red chilli powder. The dried whole chilli (with and without stem), chilli powder (ground and crushed), chilli paste, chilly chutney, and chilli seeds are all products of the Byadagi chilli. It's still in high demand in the oleoresin industry, and the oleoresin derived from it is used to make food and cosmetic products. Due to its use as a natural red colour in the food industry, the market for Byadgi chilli is skyrocketing. Byadgi chillies are used as a replacement for paprika by oleoresin producers in the international market (Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, America, Europe, Nepal, Indonesia, Mexico). Byadgi chilli traders primarily supply Byadgi chilli to leading exporters in Cochin (Kerala), Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, who then value-add the commodity and export it as Paprika Oleoresin.

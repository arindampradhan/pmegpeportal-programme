PROJECT PROFILE FOR STAINLESS STEEL WATCH STRAPS INTRODUCTION There are many types of Watch Straps, made of Leather, Nylon, Stainless Steel and Brass etc. Watch straps are made in various designs including ornamental one, being used by the public now a days. In this Project Profile, it is intended to manufacture stainless steel watch straps out of stainless steel sheet scrap and wire. Since the scrap of required gauge is easily available from the manufacturers of stainless steel utensils, it is comparatively more profitable than manufacturing these items out of virgin stainless steel sheets or coil. MARKET POTENTIAL Wrist watch has become necessity for the present day life of human beings. It is being used by people from all walks of life, male, female, educated, uneducated, young and old etc. Watch strap being an integral part of wrist watch, it has a good market for supply to meet original demand and in the replacement market. Apart from the large scale wrist watch manufacturers, such as Titan, HMT, Maxima, Allwyn, Timex etc., a good number of small scale units in many States have also come up with their phased production programme for wrist watches. The demand for the production of the item is therefore likely to increase rapidly in near future. Further, due to durability of the product it is preferred over all other types of straps. Moreover, due to fast changes in the design and liking of people, there is good replacement prospects for the product as well. Therefore, there is a good and assured future for the product. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS  This report is worked out on 60% capacity utilization, on double shift and 300 working days per year.  The machinery and equipment are of standard make.  The cost of raw materials and other expenditure is approximate and based on current market rates.  The period for achieving envisaged capacity utilization estimated to be one year after commencement of trial production.  Interest rate for fixed and working capital has been calculated at 11.50% per annum.  Payback period would commence after a period of 8 months and the repayment period is estimated as 5 years.

IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE  The entrepreneur has to arrive at a decision in order to select this product. The guiding factor in this regard would be the market potential, demand and supply gap and availability of resources. It may take 2 to 3 weeks.  After selecting the product, the entrepreneur has to get Udyog Aadhaar registration, so that he can apply for allotment of land, power, etc.  In order to obtain financial assistance from the financial Institutions like Commercial Banks a detailed project report is required to be prepared. On the basis of the report financial Institutions may take 8 to 10 weeks' time for sanctioning and disbursing the loan. Accordingly, orders for plant and machinery may be finalized and placed. Simultaneously, orders for purchase of raw materials are also to be finalized and recruitment of key staff is to be done. This would require 3 to 4 weeks.  The plant and machinery received may be installed and commissioned within 4 to 6 weeks time and the Workshop staff should also be recruited. The production may be commenced after trial run of the installed plant and machinery. TECHNICAL ASPECTS PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE The Metallic Watch Straps consist of 7 to 8 components according to its design. These components are made by balaking, piercing, and binding as per the requirements, and then these components are sent for assembly to form a chain. These chain pieces are grounded to size on a surface grinder. Mat finish on the straps can also be given by using surface grinder. After mating, straps may be polished on a buffing lathe. Links, locks and barrels are fitted to these pieces with the help of spring-loaded pins. Then these assembled straps are cleaned in kerosene oil to remove the luster particles. Finally, the final buffing is done to give polishing touch on straps. These straps are packed suitably and marketed. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS Most of the watch manufacturers like Titan, HMT, Alwyn, Maxima, Timex etc., have formulated their own specifications and design for this product, and these may be obtained from them for supply to them. However, in view of sophistication and individual liking the appearance of the straps must be good and have free link movement and reliable locking system along with appropriate polish. POLLUTION CONTROL The activity does not create any pollution. However, proper ventilation is provided for safe working conditions. ENERGY CONSERVATION General awareness is required for energy conservation.

MBI Project Profile on Lead Pencils Introduction : Lead pencils are commonly used by school children, colleges, artists, civil engineers and architects as well as office staff. An extremely popular product, pencils are used extensively by all categories of persons. Depending on the type of carbon used, pencils are classified as soft, medium and hard. There is no doubt about the acceptability of the product and lead pencils still command a respectful demand. There is also ample export potential. Considering the vastness of this country and ever increasing population, quantity of requirements of this item is enormous. Moreover with increase in activities in the field of construction and industry requirement of drawings is also increasing and so that of pencils. Hence there is a good demand for this product. Process of Manufacture: High grade graphite powder is mixed with ball clay and water and charged into ball mill. After thorough grinding, excess water is drained from the mixture, filter pressed and oven dried. Then the mixture is pressed to form billets and fed through an extrusion machine to get lead slip of required size. This extruded slip is then placed in refractory furnace and fired to form the pencil lead. Meanwhile, the wooden slats are formed/shaped on the slat machine and grooved to accommodate the lead slip. The slats are then fitted with the lead slip and glued together, allowed to set and cut and shaped to the required dimensions. Finishing, painting and marking is done on the pencils. 1 Name of the Product : Lead Pencils 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Worksheds qin.m sqtr.sft Rs.

LITHIUM-ION BATTERY Introduction A lithium-ion battery or Li-ion battery (abbreviated as LIB) is a type of rechargeable battery. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used for portable electronics and electric vehicles and are growing in popularity for military and aerospace applications. The technology was largely developed by John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, Rachid Yazami and Akira Yoshino during the 1970s–1980s, and then commercialized by a Sony and Asahi Kasei team led by Yoshio Nishi in 1991. In the batteries, lithium ions move from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to the positive electrode during discharge, and back when charging. Li-ion batteries use an intercalated lithium compound as the material at the positive electrode and typically graphite at the negative electrode. The batteries have a high energy density, no memory effect (other than LFP cells) and low self-discharge. They can however be a safety hazard since they contain a flammable electrolyte, and if damaged or incorrectly charged can lead to explosions and fires. Samsung were forced to recall Galaxy Note 7 handsets following lithium-ion fires, and there have been several incidents involving batteries on Boeing 787s. Benefits of using Lithium-ion Batteries Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are inarguably the most popular type of rechargeable battery for consumer electronics. They can be used for a variety of products from mobile phones to cars, and their qualities are superior compared to other rechargeable batteries. At Night Searcher we use high-quality lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries for all but a few of our rechargeable flashlights, searchlights, head torches, and floodlights, as they allow us to provide the high-performance, durable products our customers are used to. Below we’ve listed the biggest advantages of lithium-ion batteries from the customers’ point of view and delved into the science behind each characteristic.

 Eco-friendly: Lithium-ion batteries contain relatively low levels of toxic heavy metals found in other types of batteries, such as lead-acid and nickel-cadmium (Ni Cd) batteries. Cadmium, lead, and mercury have been battery stalwarts for years, but prolonged exposure to, and inadequate disposal of these metals is harmful to humans, animals, and plants. Although Li-ion batteries are safer than many other types of batteries they still require proper recycling, so never put your used batteries in with your regular rubbish.  Lightweight and compact: Electrodes commonly used in lithium-ion batteries, lithium and carbon, are lightweight on their own, making for much smaller and lighter batteries than their older counterparts such as lead-acid batteries. For comparison’s sake, a typical 51Ah (= ampere-hour) lithium-ion battery weighs about the same as a 24Ah lead-acid battery (about 6-7kg), but provides over twice the capacity.  High energy density: Lithium is a highly reactive element with the ability to release and store large amounts of energy, allowing li-ion batteries to pack a high energy capacity in a small size. This translates to lithium-ion batteries lasting much longer between charges than other rechargeable batteries, while still maintaining their high level of performance.  Low maintenance: Older types of rechargeable batteries, such as nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal hydride batteries had a so-called “memory effect”, or “lazy battery effect”: If they were repeatedly partially discharged before being recharged, ultimately the battery would only deliver the amount of energy that was used during the partial discharges before its voltage would drop. To avoid this, Ni Cd and Ni MH batteries would need to be regularly maintained by completely discharging and recharging them.

b) Grading Machine c) CDS d) BMS Testing Machine e) Hot Air Gun f) Spot welding Machine Lithium-ion Battery Analysis & Potential These batteries are utilized in mobile phone, notebook and similar devices there shape and size varies based on application. The lithium- ion battery market is expected to grow exponentially in the next five years in India and its recycling offers a $1000 million opportunity by 2030. The lithium-ion battery market in India is expected to increase from 2.9 GWh in 2018 to about 132 GWh by 2030 (CAGR of 35.5%). The increasing volume of lithium-ion batteries would, in turn, lead to a growing capacity of 'spent' batteries in the ecosystem which if left untreated would lead to health and environmental hazards. Initiatives by the centre that will accelerate the growth of lithium-ion battery market in India include National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020, with a projection of getting 6-7 million electric vehicles on Indian roads by 2020, installation of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. Lithium-ion Battery Manufacturing Process 1. Grading: In this process all the cells are graded before moving towards battery manufacturing process. 2. Welding: After grading, welding of cells are done in series and parallel as per customer requirement. Like: voltage 3. Soldering: Then solider BMS with the welded battery pack. 4. Testing: After soldering test the battery packs and then fix up the BMS with battery. 5. Charging & discharging: After the mounting of BMS, we have to check the battery charging and discharging, Whether it is charging or not.

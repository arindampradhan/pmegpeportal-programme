GUNNY BAG MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Jute is a naturally occurring, inexpensive fiber that is biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Because of its natural golden shine, jute is also known as “the golden fiber.” Jute is most commonly used to make consumer goods such as bags and rugs. When the jute industry started in India, one of the earlier developments was the manufacture of jute sacks. The bulk of jute sack production is used for all types of jute bags. Sacking bags, woven wholly from jute fabrics, are available as plain and twill bags. Jute bags, the other name for sacking bags are mainly used to pack cement, sugar, and other bulky articles, which are packed in weight range from 50 to 100kgs. These are tailored as per customers’ specifications in terms of size and to meet the ever-increasing demand for jute bags in the farm sector, agro‐based industries, and cement industries. The Jute Textiles Industry occupies an important place in the national economy. It is one of the major industries in the eastern region, particularly in West Bengal. It supports nearly 4 million farm families, besides providing direct employment to about 2.6 lac industrial workers. The jute industry is labor-intensive and contributes about Rs.1,200 crores annually to export earnings. Sutli consists of few strands of jute and is a thin rope.

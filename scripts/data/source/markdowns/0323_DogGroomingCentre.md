MOBILE DOG GROOMING CENTER 1. INTRODUCTION Basic grooming and cleaning services are, of course, the most basic service for a pet grooming company. However, there is a growing demand for animal pampering facilities such as facials and other treatments. Any grooming companies specialise on one kind of product, such as dealing exclusively with dogs, while others have a wider variety of facilities for a wider range of animals. Some dogs do not have the type of fur that needs to be trimmed, while others, including those competing in dog shows, may need a very precise haircut. However, any full- service dog grooming Package would almost certainly contain the following:  bath (typically with anti-flea and anti-tick shampoo)  Scrubbing  Cleaning in the eyes and ears  Trimming your nails  Brushing your teeth  Hairstyles (if needed)  Anaesthetic  Anal Gland Expression Any of these programmes may be difficult to conduct yourself, depending on the dog's type and/or temperament. This is particularly true if your dog's hair is thick and curly and resistant to matting. Alternatively, if you have a restless dog that won't hold still long enough for you to

trim their nails safely. In these instances, having a licenced dog groomer do these things is better and more convenient (for both you and your dog). Dog groomers will assist you with identifying any problems with your dog's eyes, ears, lips, and skin that you might not be aware of. Ticks, bacteria, skin diseases, and gum disease are only a few of the things to look for. As the pet population expands and more people get involved in all facets of caring for their dogs, the pet services market is booming. If you choose to specialise in dogs or cats or work with a general groomer, animal grooming is a profession with many options. Grooming is also a good option for those interested in starting their own company. Since the pet grooming industry in India isn't well-defined, trained trainers are required to dedicatedly train aspiring groomers. Not all can afford to go overseas or take expensive pet grooming lessons. These groomers, in particular, have their own grooming salons where they both train and operate their companies. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Grooming is a common luxury service that pet owners request for their animals. Many pet owners don't have the patience, skill, or motivation to clean their pets themselves, so they hire groomers who have had the necessary training. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Pet grooming encompasses both the hygienic treatment and washing of a dog, as well as the practise of enhancing a dog's physical image for competitions such as dog shows. A dog groomer (or merely "groomer") is a professional who grooms dogs for a living. The process of Dog grooming includes:  Blade/clippers: Clippers are a razor-style tool used to take length off a dog's coat. While blades are part of the overall clippers tool, you may hear these terms used somewhat interchangeably.  Carding: A process that removes the loose, dead undercoat using a blunt-edged tool.  Clean face: Shaving the face, muzzle and cheeks with a shorter blade.  Clean feet: The feet are completely shaved, exposing the nails and the entire foot up to the ankle.  Clipping and sizing: Clippers come with different size blades and snap-on combs to allow groomers to cut hair to different lengths. The lower the number of the blade, the less coat length will be removed.

## Page 5

 For example, a number 4F blade will leave approximately ½-inch of fur, while a number 7F blade will leave only about ⅛-inch of fur.  De-matting: The process of removing matted fur.  Forced-air drying: It is a process where groomers use dryer after towel-drying a dog to completely dry the fur.  Hand stripping and plucking: This is a technique in which a stripping tool or fingers are used to remove the dead outer coat of wire-haired breeds (like most terriers). Different styles for grooming:  Pom-pom: A stylistic cut of a dog’s coat typically done on poodles and other fluffy-coated dogs. The pom-poms look like balls of fur placed above clean feet and on the end of the tail.  Round feet: The feet are shaped cleaned by scissor to look round and fluffy without showing the nails.  Scissoring: This is a technique using scissors and a metal comb to complete and finish the trim. This is usually done when the pet parent asks for the dog to be trimmed longer than a clipper blade will allow. It also is used for finishing trim work on a dog's face, feet and tail areas where clippers cannot be used.  Shaving in reverse: This dog grooming term means that the groomer is shaving against the grain of the hair, or from the back of the dog toward the front.  Skirting: The long hair that falls on either side of a dog's body between the front and back legs to create a skirt look.  Topknot (TK): A ponytail or pigtails on top of the head, held in place with a barrette, bow or binder. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work No specific area requirement for mobile dog grooming service centre. But you can have little area like: 300-500 Sq Ft for administrative purpose. 3.2 Plant & Machinery 3.2.1. Equipment  Dog Grooming Vans and fabrication unit: These vans are moving grooming center equipped with all the facilities required for grooming.

 Curry or curry brush: A weapon with short "teeth" made of rubber or plastic. The tool is rubbed (or "curried") over the dog's coat to loosen soil, feathers, and other debris while also stimulating the skin's natural oil production.  Shedding razor: A metal blade (or "sweat scraper") with small, blunt teeth used to cut dead hair and matted fur from some forms of rough coats. The hair is not sliced with the shedding razor.

## Page 7

 Slicker brush: A flat surface brush with fine, small wires close together. It is used to strip mats from medium-to-long-haired or curly-haired dogs. After brushing with a bristle or wire pin brush, slicker brushes are usually used.  Rake: A brush intended to go deep into a dog's thick coat to clear tangles and dead undercoat close to the skin. It has one or two sets of closely spaced pins and is shaped like a shaving razor.  Bristle brush: Owing to its flexibility, this is one of the most commonly used brush styles. On dogs with long coats, the bristle brush is typically used to finish the coat and pull out the natural luster and shine. It prevents surface dust and debris and is widely used in everyday grooming.

## Page 8

 Wire Pin Brush: Metal bristles are placed in a flexible rubber base on the wire pin brush, which has an oval appearance. Separates and untangles the fur of dogs with long, wiry, wavy, or curly coats. Few wire pin brushes have brushed or painted pins to avoid scraping the skin of the dog when in use.  Combination pin/bristle brush: has two sides: one with bristles, which can be used to groom short hair regions of the coat, and another with pins, which can be used to groom long-coated and double-coated dogs.

 Mat comb: A tool for removing matted fur from a dog's coat without leaving a bald patch.  Stripping combs/knives: Tools for grabbing and pulling off longer hairs from a harsh coat by the root. In certain terriers and schnauzers, it aids in the maintenance of a healthy coat. Show dogs are the ones who need it the most.

 Shears and clippers are cutting instruments that are used to remove/shorten hair from some coats or vulnerable areas.  Stand dryers, cage dryers, and hand dryers are all types of dryers. This item is used to dry the dog's hair. It is not advisable to dry a dog with a dryer intended for humans because it can cause scalp itching, dry skin, or skin sores.

 Grooming tables: These are tables that offer a safe and efficient atmosphere for grooming, but often single dog owners can save money by merely using what they already have at home. VAN EQUIPMENTS S.

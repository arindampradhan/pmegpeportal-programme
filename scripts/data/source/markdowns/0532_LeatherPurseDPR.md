LEATHER PURSE MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Leather is commonly used for designer labels and other luxury bags. It is because it can easily be cut, shaped, and designed in many ways. Furthermore, its durability has been tested by time. The beauty it provides is evident in many social events. There is no question that it is one of the most favorite materials by many fashion aficionados. Now women can purchase high-quality designer handbags- with-a-conscience that they can be proud to carry. The only concern about this material is the price. Definitely, it is by far expensive, especially if it comes from exotic animals. Even ordinary leather is not cheap at all. It is because the process of making it is laborious. Uses & Market Potential: A handbag, commonly known as a purse is a handled medium-to-large bag used to carry personal items by women. These products are great in style and durable. In this project we are making leather purse (Ladies Purse) of different shapes and size. Leather accessories accounts for 26.44% export shares in the country.

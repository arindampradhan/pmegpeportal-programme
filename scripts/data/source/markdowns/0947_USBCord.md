USB CORD MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The term USB stands for "Universal Serial Bus". USB cord or USB cable assemblies are some of the most popular cord types available, which is used mostly to connect smartphones or computers to peripheral devices such as cameras, camcorders, printers, scanners, and more. There are a few basic parts to a USB cord - there are the two connecting ends, and the wires inside, as well as the sheath around the wires. The cord allows transfer of data between the computer and the device attached by USB. USB cords are used for the purpose of connecting a USB device with a host device which may include wide range of computing devices, gaming consoles and others. The universal serial bus cord may have various kinds of plug end. The type of plug end would be referred to as a connector. These plugs are connected with corresponding receptacle to devices and hosts. The micro and mini receptacles universal serial bus find its application in small portable devices which includes cellular phones and digital cameras. USB Cords can also be used for device charging. For USB charger cord data pins are not connected with wires where for USB data cord data pins are connected to the wire.

Uses & Market Potential: USB cord can be used as- • USB data cord • Mobile Charging Chord • Multifunctional USB cord USB cord used mostly to connect smartphones and computers to peripheral devices such as cameras, camcorders, printers, scanners, and more. Innovation of super speed USB cords are expected to drive the global universal serial bus (USB) cord market over the next few years. This USB cord with latest technology will provide enhanced speed and performance like transferring files from 480 Mbps to 10 Gbps and above. Moreover, other factors like improved power efficiency, interoperability of power supply are expected to drive the global universal serial bus (USB) cord market over the next few years. Latest innovation and growth in wireless technology is key factor restraining the global universal serial bus (USB) cord market over the next few years. Internal substitutes like the Type C USB cord has replaced traditional used USB cords and thus latest devices are no longer compatible with the traditional used USB type, thus restraining the market further. In terms of revenue in past years Micro USB cord accounted for the largest market share in the global universal serial bus (USB) cord market. Micro USB cords are used in smart phones, tablets, hard drive and digital cameras. Thus, with the rise in consumption of these consumers electronics the demand for USB cord is also expected to grow over the next few years. Product: USB Cord

Raw Material: Basic raw material are:  Plastic: Plastic granules are used for injection moulding process.  Connectors: USB cord assemblies are designed with several distinct connector types. USB male and female connector type are used for USB cord manufacturing. The different connector types have an important strategic purpose to them.  Wires: The wires themselves are typically made of copper or silver, like many electronic devices. This is because both metals are particularly good conductors. These cords transmit data from point A to point B, passing the information along. Manufacturing Process:  Raw material procurement  Cord processing  Soldering process- Connector soldering  Injection moulding  Testing  Packaging

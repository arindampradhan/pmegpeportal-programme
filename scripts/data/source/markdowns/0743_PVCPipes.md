PVC PIPES Introduction PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it’s become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC’s strength, durability, easy installation, and low cost have made it one of the most widely used plastics in the world. PVC is a thermoplastic material that is molded into different shapes to create pipes, fittings, valves and other liquid handling supplies. It's the white plastic pipe commonly used for plumbing and drainage. PVC pipes are manufactured by extrusion of raw material PVC, and generally follow the same steps of typical pipe extrusion operations: Feeding of raw material pellets / powder into the PVC twin screw extruder. Melting and heating in multiple extruder zones. Types of PVC Pipes Two main types of PVC pipe exist: schedule 40 and schedule 80. The difference lies in the thickness of the pipe wall. Schedule 40 PVC pipes have thinner walls than their schedule 80 counterparts. If you come across a different schedule number than the typical 40 or 80, know that the higher the number, the thicker the pipe wall. Thicker walls come in handy for different pressure and temperature applications. To help you make the correct purchase, PVC pipes have their schedule and pounds per square inch (PSI) rating printed on the side. Application of PVC Pipes PVC is currently used in a wide spectrum of piping applications, all helping to meet modern infrastructure need.

 Water applications: VC piping systems are used in several areas for the transport of water - from delivery of drinking water over the removal of sewage or waste products to drainage of water from the ground or roof.  Drinking water: Pipes and fittings for the distribution of water under pressure. The main application is the distribution of drinking water. The diameters are of medium size (generally between 75 mm and 250 mm).  Soil and waste: Pipes and fittings for the evacuation of waste water without pressure inside the buildings (generally vertical). These are usually of medium diameters (< 160 mm). They can be made of compact PVC or have structured walls (foam core).  Sewage and underground drainage: Pipes and fittings for the collection and evacuation of waste water without pressure and intended to be buried in the ground (horizontally). These are usually of large diameter (160 mm and up to 630 mm). They can be made of compact PVC or have structured walls (foam core or twin wall with a corrugated layer). Description of PVC Pipes Manufacturing Machine Following machines are used for Single Screw PVC Pipes Manufacturing unit: a) High Speed Mixture machine b) Rigid Extruder machine c) Granule-ds Extruder Machine d) Grinder e) Different Dies PVC Pipes market analysis & Potential The global PVC pipes market reached a volume of 22.8 Million Tons in 2018, growing at a CAGR of 5.4% during 2011-2018.

further projected to reach a volume of 30.5 Million Tons by 2024, expanding at a CAGR of 4.9% during 2019-2024. PVC pipes are composed by the extrusion of a blend of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and several additives. The production of PVC pipes consumes around four times lesser energy and incurs lower losses of the raw material in comparison to concrete pipes. Moreover, complete recyclability of PVC makes the environmental footprint of these pipes far smaller than the alternative piping materials. Owing to these factors, PVC pipes find applications in water systems, underground wiring and sewer lines. PVC Pipes Manufacturing Process  PVC stands for Polyvinyl Chloride it’s a polymer which is used in several application from wire to pipe, due to its insulation and strength properties.

 The PVC Granules are feed to mixer via Hooper and feeder arrangement along with the various additives; it ensures that various additives are uniformly distributed within the PVC Granules followed by which the granules additive mixture is feed to Extruder.  Extruder melts these granules into semi-solid state and forces them through the die attached to it utilizing a plunger or screw arrangement. The die has cavity of shape of pipe, hence a continuous pipe is obtained from extruder die.  An appropriate cooling system is used to cool the pipe formed by extruder usually an air cooler, then this continuous pipe goes through a printing machine where the required labels are printed onto pipe followed by which these pipes are cut into required length by a simple cutter and sent for sale. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Single Screw PVC Pipe Machine (50 Kg per Hour Capacity): Cost Rs. 20-25 Lacs. This machine includes: Extruder, Water tank, Cutter, Mixture & Grinder Name Cost Mixture Rs. 2-2.5 Lacs Grinder Rs. 25,000 Extruder Rs. 5 Lakhs  Cost of the machine is exclusive of GST & value of the machine varies with the change in production capacity. Note: This project report is based on Single Screw PVC Pipe Manufacturing Machine. Land &Building required: Land required 1500-1800 Square Feet (approx.) Approximate Rent for the same is Rs. 30000-35000 Per Month.

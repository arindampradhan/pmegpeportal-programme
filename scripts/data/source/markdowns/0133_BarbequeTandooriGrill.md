1. INTRODUCTION Barbeque is a term used with significant regional and national variations to describe various cooking methods which use live fire and smoke to cook the food. The term is also generally applied to the devices associated with those methods, the broader cuisines that these methods produce, and the meals or gatherings at which this style of food is cooked and served. The cooking methods associated with barbequing vary significantly but most involve outdoor cooking. Grilling is a form of cooking that involves a dry heat applied to the food, either from above or below. Grilling is an effective technique in order to cook meat or vegetables quickly since it involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat. A barbecue tandoor grill is an appliance that cooks food by applying heat from below. It is used for making varieties of grilled dishes that gives smoky flavor to the food being cooked. The three main types of grills are: gas, charcoal and electric. The words "barbeque" and "grilling" are often used interchangeably, although food experts argue that barbecue is a type of grilling, and that grilling involves the use of a higher level of heat to sear the food, while barbecuing is a slower process over a low heat. Barbeque tandoor Grill are portable too. It can be easily carried as well, if you are traveling to a place where you might need it. It is a perfect appliance for making outdoor picnic.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES This appliance can be used in household sectors, restaurants, food joints, cafe, etc. to make many non-vegetarians as well as vegetarian dishes. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL The major raw material required for manufacturing of BBQ Tandoori Grill are:  Stainless Steel Sheet Metal (Cold rolled steel sheets CR Sheets)  Angle Iron  Flat Bar  Galvanized Steel Grid (Cooking Grids)  Stick Electrodes  Carbon Plate  BBQ Spray Paint  Other Electrical Components (such as screws, nuts, bolts, etc.)  Packaging Material (Boxes, Plastic Bags, etc 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Raw material procurement After purchasing the required raw material, it will go for quality checking, sorting and it will be stored in the store department or raw material inventory. Quality control of raw material is the maintaining of all the procedures that are needed to be taken to produce a quality full product. In

the sorting procedure, the different types of materials or parts will be sorted out such as electrical components and plastic etc. The material will be stored and maintain till further use. Fabricating the Barbeque Machine main frame Fabrication of machine main frame starts from construction of the outer rigid structure made of C. R. steel sheet. For these four cuts of 28 inches are made into steel sheets with the help of shearing machine. Similarly, four cuts of 16 inches and four of 18 inches are made. Holes are made at appropriate places on the cut pieces for making vents through punch press. These cut pieces are welded through electric welding to form a cubical shape of length 28-inch, height 18 inch and width 16 inch. Finally ridges and raises on the welded surface are removed with surface grinder wheel. Supporting frame is made by welding four 4.5 inches long hollow pipe to the main body and attaching wheels to it. Now two pieces of flat bars of 250mm length are cut to make the handles. At distance of 50mm from both edges, do 90° bending. These handles are mounted/ welded at the middle of the short sides of the upper frame. Electroplating of Cooking Grid & Painting of Outer Body The cooking grids are electroplated. Electroplating creates a protective barrier and prevent tarnishing of a cooking grid surface as well as protecting it from wear and tear by applying a thin, durable metal coating on it. Along with providing protection, it will also increase its aesthetic appeal.

The outer body of the frame is painted with a rust and corrosion resistant paint for durability and giving finish to the body of the BBQ Grill Machine. Assembly Manufactured upper and supporting frame along with all other components such as electroplated grill, carbon plate etc. will be collected at the assembly line and are fitted at proper places on the body of the BBQ. Testing & Packaging After passing vigorous testing, the BBQ Tandoori Grill is sent to packaging, where the appliance will be packed, boxed and shipped.

FLOW CHART OF THE PROCESS Raw Material Procurement Fabricating the BBQ Frame Electroplating & Painting Assembly Testing & Packaging 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 to 40,000 per month.

3.2 Plant & Machinery  Turret punch press machine: A turret punch or turret press is a type of punch press used for metal forming by punching. Turret punching involves pushing a punch through a piece of metal to create a hole. The turret punch can make holes in a variety of different diameters and can make about as many holes in a sheet of metal as you may need for your fabrication.  Shearing machine: The workpiece is fixed in the machine tool and subsequently cut by pressing a blade through the workpiece and into a die underneath. Unlike many other processes, shearing does not use a rotating tool-piece. Instead, it works like a pair of scissors which means a blade presses against it using a good amount of force.  Electroplating Machine: Electroplating is basically the process of plating a metal onto the other by hydrolysis mostly to prevent corrosion of metal.

 Press Brake Machine: A press brake is a machine pressing tool for bending sheet and plate material, most commonly sheet metal. It forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die.  Bench Drilling Machine: The bench drill is used for drilling holes through materials including a range of woods, plastics and metals. It is normally bolted to a bench so that it cannot be pushed over and that larger pieces of material can be drilled safely.

RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS Paddy is the most basic raw material required. Food grade packaging of paper and HDPE with inner liner is required. Cardboard boxes for packing of seasoning in bunch are required. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Graded, sorted paddy is stored in wooden drums or tanks. Boiling water is poured on the paddy. It is allowed to soak for about 30 hours. The paddy is removed from water a couple of hours before the commencement of work. Every time about 25 kg. Of paddy, duly roasted in contact with fine sand tills two or three grains burst, is fed into the flaking machine after removing sand. The rollers of the flaking machine are adjusted according to the fineness of the flakes desired. In a short time the paddy is pressed into fine flakes. By pressing scrapers against the rim all flakes are collected near the centre of the drum and are removed by hand. The sorted and graded flakes thus obtained are packed in suitable polythene lined jute bags. PLANT & MACHINERY PARTICULARS QTY. RATE AMOUNT IN RS.

DESICCATED COCONUT POWDER Introduction: India is the third largest coconut producing country in the world. As per the survey reports conducted by coconut development board in 2013-14 the annual production of coconut in Kerala is 5798.04 million nuts and the state has become the 3rd largest coconut producing state in the country. In Kerala about 60% of the coconuts are used for the manufacturing of oil and the rest for the preparation of food. Copra and coconut oil are the two major products of the coconut processing industry. Nearly 60% of the total production of nuts is utilized for food uses and the rest goes in for oil extraction. In spite of the fact that Kerala has the necessary raw material to launch new product lines, minimum efforts has been taken place for producing more value added products like coconut chips. Coconut vinegar, desiccated coconut powdered has taken place in the application of modern technology for full utilization of various coconut products such as desiccated coconut, coconut cream powder, partially defatted coconut gratings, bottled coconut water, etc., Desiccated coconut is widely used in the preparation of sweets, confectionery, curry preparation etc. Uses & Market Potential: It is used in making cookies, cakes, pastries, desserts, puddings or any other coconut based recipe where raw grated coconut cannot be used. Dried coconut can be consumed as a snack, in

cereal, baked goods, salad, smoothies or sauteed with vegetables. Being a mass consumption item, desiccated coconut has a good market. At present about 4000 tones of desiccated coconut is manufactured annually and used mainly by 3 confectionery and biscuit industry. In Kerala coconut is the major ingredient used in the preparation of Breakfast lunch and Dinner. In the preparation of curries coconut paste is usually added. Instead of that desiccated coconut powder may be added . Desiccated coconut may find good market in areas where coconuts are not produced particularly in Northern India. Now-a-days food habits of our people are changing very fast and a number of food items are being introduced every day where desiccated coconut may also find use. So there is a good scope for new small scale units to come up in this line of manufacture. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Coconut with husk 2. Packing Material Machinery Requirements: Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Cabinet type hot air drier with blower, motor 1 185000 and other accessories 2. Disintegrator 12" size with 10HP motor and 1 105000 accessories 3. Vibratory sifting machine fitted with GI wire 1 50000 mesh and 2 Hp motor 4. Aluminium Trays 10 15000 5. Platform weighing Balance 1 20000 6. Polythene sealing machine 2 50000 7. Other misc items like scrapping knives, 25000 trolleys etc Total Amount 450000

Manufacturing Process: Firstly, in the manufacture of desiccated coconut is the selection of coconuts. The quality of desiccated coconut depends upon the quality of coconuts used. Fully matured coconuts of about 12 months are used for the preparation of desiccated coconut. Fully matured nuts are stored with the husk for about one month so that the water inside the kernels is absorbed. This also facilitates coconut kernels to get separated from shell walls. The coconuts are dehusked and their shells are removed. The brown portion of nuts called tasta is removed by scrapping it off. About 10-15% of the kernel goes as paring by this process. These parings can be pressed out after drying to get oil which can be used for soap making. Deshelled coconuts are broken into pieces, washed properly and disintegrated into powders of various grades. The powder is then dried in a drier by spreading it out uniformly in trays. The temperature in the drying chamber is maintained at about 180O F and the powder is stirred occasionally during the drying process to ensure uniform drying. Great care should be taken during drying. When powder is dried, it is cooled and passed through a vibratory screen having different sizes (12, 14 and 16 mesh). The segregated material is packed in oil proof, moisture proof polythene lined plywood boxes of 25 kgs. It may also be packed in polybags of 250 gms, 500 gms for retail sale. During the process of manufacturing desiccated coconut, a number of by products such as coconut shell, parings, and husks are obtained which may be converted into various items of great importance. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil Work cost will be Rs. 4 Lacs (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp

Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require.  FSSAI License  NOC from State Pollution Control Board

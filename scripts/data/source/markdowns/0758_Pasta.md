PASTA UNIT Introduction Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine. Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.[3] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines. Pasta is becoming extremely popular in India even as Continental and Italian delicacy. Cereals like wheat, rice, maize and millets are staple food grain for majority of population around the world. These are the rich source of carbohydrates and supply of calorie and other nutrients to the consumers. Apart from value addition by processing to traditional products from these grains, development of new products offers Variety, Convenience, Quality, Cost efficiency and Scope for increasing nutritional value. In the developed countries many convenience foods are prepared by extrusion process using extruder, as it offers a large number of desired characteristics to be incorporated in the product. Ingredients Instant Pasta is made from Fine semolina (Suji), Wheat flour, Milk solid is the main ingredients in pasta. Qualities of Instant Pasta 1. Easy to prepare 2. Lower In fat. 3. It has right thickness, allowing it to cook evenly 4. It remains compact, strong and elastic, even many hours it has been cooked.

Description of Pasta Machine Although pasta products were first introduced in Italy in the 13th century, efficient manufacturing equipment and high-quality ingredients have been available only since the 20th century. Prior to the industrial revolution, most pasta products were made by hand in small shops. Today, most pasta is manufactured by continuous, high capacity extruders, which operate on the auger extrusion principle in which kneading and extrusion are performed in a single operation Pasta Machines are used to produce pasta from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, extruding, drying& packaging completes in a very short span. Pasta Market Analysis The popularity of Pasta can be attributed to its sensory appeal, Versatility, Low Cost, ease of preparation, Nutritional content and excellent storage stability as well as increased consumer interest in ethnic foods in the Western world. The demand for pasta is gaining immense popularity in India, particularly amongst the younger population, due to expansion in food-service restaurants. “Indian Pasta Market: Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2018-2023”, the pasta market in India reached a sales value of US$ 286.6 Million in 2017, exhibiting a CAGR of 17.1% during 2010- 2017. As noodle’s main ingredients is all purpose flour (Maida), which is very bad for human apatite where pasta came from Semolina, which is good in nutrition and very easy to enzyme. Urbanization is the key factor of pasta business. The primary factors catalysing the growth of the pasta market in India include rising urbanisation, changing lifestyles and surging demand for ready-to-eat products. In addition to this, the market is also influenced by an increasing women employment rate coupled with rising disposable incomes. Further, the health-conscious consumers are demanding food products with healthier ingredients, which have led to a rise in the demand for pasta made with whole-wheat. Some of the other forces that have been proactive in maintaining the market growth are longer shelf- life and ease of preparation. Looking forward, the market is registering a

CAGR of 16.2% during 2018-2023, Pasta product have good potential especially in the Middle east/south east Asia. Automatic Pasta Manufacturing Process Step 1: Take Semolina (Rava) of different batches like 300 KG/hour, 500 KG/hour, 100 KG/hour, which depends upon the machine capacity and pour it into the hopper. Step 2: After that with the help of screw conveyer (of 12 feet, made of stainless steel) the rava is fed into the online mixer and then add water accordingly. Step 3: Mix for 15-20 minutes by maintaining the temperature accordingly. Step 4: After Mixing pour it into pasta extruder made of mild steel. Step 5: Now, use the moulds for different types of shapes required for pasta and fed into the vibro feeder. Step 6: After that dry the pasta with the help of static dryer & packed the pasta for selling it into the market.

PP DRINKING STRAW Introduction: A drinking straw or drinking tube is a small pipe that allows its user to more conveniently consume a beverage. A thin tube of plastic (such as polypropylene and polystyrene), or other material is used by placing one end in the mouth and the other in the beverage. Drinking straws can be straight or have an angle-adjustable bellows segment. PP is quiet stable against biodegradation (is a non-biodegradable material), whereas straw is a biodegradable natural composite material. Most single-use plastic straws are made from polypropylene, a type of plastic commonly made from petroleum. Polypropylene is thought to be food-safe in amounts approved by the Food and Drug Administration. PP is not an additive, it is used as continuous phase and matrix of composites made of various reinforcing materials, such as straw, carbon fibers, and glass fibers. Uses & Market Potential: Paper drinking straw is expected to have the high market growth due to rising demand of the paper drinking straw as the packaging industry is witnessing shift towards non-plastic sustainable materials from plastic products. Consumers are widely using the paper drinking straws at home, parties, on-the-go drinks, concession stands, food service, schools, institutional and others. The global drinking straw market is segmented based on type as plastic drinking straw, and paper drinking straw.

Paper drinking straw is expected to have the high market growth due to rising demand of the paper drinking straw as the packaging industry is witnessing shift towards non-plastic sustainable materials from plastic products. Consumers are widely using the paper drinking straws at home, parties, on the- go drinks, concession stands, food service, schools, institutional and Others . Plastic drinking straw segment is expected to have the negative market growth over the forecasted period due to the banning of the plastic straws. Corporations, municipalities, and governments are imposing bans on the plastic straws. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. PP Pellets 2. Colorants 3. Packing material Machinery Requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: Description Set Amount PP Straw making machine including Extruder, 1 Set 1420000 cooling plant and cutter Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 1470000 Manufacturing Process: In the first step, the raw materials are procured from the local vendor and stored in the inventory. The PP resins, colorants and stabilizers are added in required proportion. The profile dies are mounted at the end of extruder. The barrel heaters are started and brought up to the desired melting temperature of PP. The PP resins, colorants and stabilizers are added into the hopper of the extruder manually. From the hopper, these plastic pellets come into the feed section of the barrel. There is a screw inside the barrel which rotates about the horizontal axis and moves the pellets into heating section of barrel where

these plastic pellets melt to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the die mounted at the end of extruder. There is possibility of making straws having more than one colour. This is performed by adding different colours pellets with PP in one or two extruder. Then the molten flow of all the other two extruders is combined with the main extruder. The rotating speed of the screw of the two colour extruder is lower than the main extruder. The combined output is allowed to flow out the die of circular shape at desired pressure. The extruder output is allowed to flow through the water tank to gets cool down and solidified. The solidified straws are cut down as per required length using two wheeled hauled and cutting unit. These straws are collected into the bins are packed and dispatched. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

# 0428 Project Profile On Hard Rubber Battery Containers

## Page 1

"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" PROJECT PROFILE ON HARD RUBBER BATTERY CONTAINERS The demand for automobile batteries is increasing day by day. Hence the manufacture of battery containers should also be developed with reference to the production of batteries as well as automobiles. Since all the required machinery is indigenously available with no scarcity for raw materials at present, the industry is ideally suited to be taken up in the Small Scale sector. The demand for automobile batteries is increasing day by day with the fast development of automobile industry in the country. Hence it is needles to emphasis that the manufacture of battery containers should also be developed with reference tot he production of batteries as well as automobiles. While functioning as an ancillary unit to the large battery manufacturers this industry also offers good scope for creation of number of small scale battery assembly units. Process of Manufacture:Natural rubber, synthetic rubber and reclaimed rubber are mixed with other ingredients and chemicals in a two roll mixing mill to make the rubber compound. It is then filled into suitable moulds and cured in a steam heated hydraulic press. After curing, the pressure is released, the containers removed from the moulds and the edges and corners trimmed and packed The demand for automobile batteries is increasing day by day with the fast development of automobile industry in the country. Hence it is needles to emphasis that the manufacture of battery containers should also be developed with reference tot he production of batteries as well as automobiles. While functioning as an ancillary unit to the large battery manufacturers this industry also offers good scope for creation of number of small scale battery assembly units. Reclaimed rubber, natural runner, synthetic rubber, sulphor, ebonate, carbon black, fillers, hydrated lime, accelerators, retarders, process oil etc 1 Name of the Product : HARD RUBBER BATTERY CONTAINERS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.ft Rs. 800,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 800,000.00 Rubber mixing mill,Hydraulic press,Boier,Weighing balance,Teating equipments Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 1,600,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 492,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 2,092,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in 000) Sr. No. Particulars Capacity in No./Q.

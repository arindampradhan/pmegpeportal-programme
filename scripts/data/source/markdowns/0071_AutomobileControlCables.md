Project Profile On Automobile Control Cables Introduction Auto control cables are widely used in various controls of two/three-wheel vehicles. Twisting of desired/required number of S. S. wires, of standard wire gauge of different diameter into one cable makes these. The numbers of S. S. wires of standard gauge depend upon the end use of the auto control cables like brake wire, clutch wire, accelerator wire etc. Each type of cable is of different size depending upon the specific purpose of the cable. The S. S. standard gauge wires are twisted in the twisting machine and cut to the required length. One end of the cable is butted and dipped in the molten zinc to avoid ends opening and at the other end of the cable a Zinc stopper of required size/design is fixed by Die- casting process. The Auto control cables are the fast-moving spares used in two/three-wheel vehicles and have very good replacement market. These cables enable the driver to control the various vehicle functions, and have a very wide market all over the country. The machines, equipment and raw material for manufacturing these cables are easily available and the technology is fully indigenized. The Unit can be set up in all major cities or near the city area and requires very nominal investment in plant and machines. Market Potential Auto control cables have a very wide and never-ending replacement market, as the various control cables have to be replaced in any Scooter, Motorcycle, Auto Rickshaw, Moped etc. These are always required by Mechanics and Service stations. Different cables for different end use are packed in printed poly bags and marketed in dozen packing through the Auto part dealers/shops.

Basis and Presumptions  The project report has been prepared keeping in view the following basis and presumptions while calculating the cost of project and that of production  Unit will run 8 hours per day for 300 working days in a year.  Unit will manufacture all types of Auto Control Cables for two/three Wheelers for brake, clutch, accelerator etc. Poly bags are got printed as per the requirements from outside.  Rates in respect of Machines and Equipment are based upon the rates quoted by a particular manufacturer. Rates of Raw material and other inputs are based upon those prevailing in local market. Technical Aspects Process of Manufacture S. S. wire of required standard wire gauge are reeled into the bobbins on the reel winder and loaded onto the bobbin’s holder of the wire twisting machine. Now with the help of wire twisting machine the required number of S. S. wires are twisted and converted into a single stranded wire of continuos length. The number of S. S. wires and gauge depend upon the type and use of Auto control cable to be made. The stranded/twisted cable thus made is cut with the help of wire cutting machine into the required size. One end of this wire is butted and dipped into molten Zinc to avoid opening of strands of the cable. At the other end of the cable a zinc stopper of required design/size is fixed with help of a die on a die-casting Machine. The cables thus made are checked/ inspected and packed in printed poly bags for marketing.

Process Flow Chart S. S. Wires Reeling into Bobbins Twisting on Wire Twisting Machine Cutting to Required Size on Wire Cutting Machine End Finishing and Dipping into Molten Zinc Flowering of Other end and Stopper Casting Inspection Packing Store/Dispatch Quality Control and Standards The Bureau of Indian Standards has laid down following Indian Standard for Auto Control Cables IS 1978. Production Capacity Based upon the single shift working of 8 hours per day and taking 25 working days in a month, the production of the unit will be as under Production (per year) 60,000 Dozen Motive Power Power requirement for the unit will be 5 HP (approx.) with single phase supply. Pollution Control The production activities are very simple in nature and there is no pollution involved. However, while melting zinc provision for exhaust of gases be made through a small chimney and exhaust muffler.

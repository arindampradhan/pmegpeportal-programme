Manufacturing Process: Step wise process of chocolate manufacturing is as follows:  Roasting and Winnowing the Cocoa: Initially chocolate manufacturers roast the cocoa beansso as to develop the flavour and colour of beans. Then the outer shell of beans is removed and inner cocoa bean is broken down intofine pieces called “cocoa nibs”. The cocoa nibs are then passed through a series of sieves, which sort the nibs according totheir size in a process called “winnowing”.  Grinding the Cocoa Nibs: In this process cocoa nibs are ground into cocoa powder in a chocolate grinding machine, which crushes the nibs utilizing its stone grinders and simultaneously melts the cocoa powder obtained from crushing into thick concentrate of cocoa called cocoa liquor.  Mixing: A mixer is used to blend all the raw material component along with Cocoa Liquor so as to obtain a blend of chocolate, the mixing process is slow and elongated over a period of time so as to obtain a uniform blend.  Blending Cocoa Liquor and Moulding Chocolate: The blend obtained from mixing is further refined, so as to bring the particle size of added sugar down to the required fineness. Then cocoa blend is blended again with cocoa liquor, sugar, milk powder, cocoa butter & other preservatives in appropriate variations as per the variety of chocolate being produced. After blending is completed, moulding is the final stage for chocolate processing. In mouldingchocolate blend is allowed to cool and harden into different shapes depending on the mould they are fed in.  Packaging and Distribution: The final step in this process is to pack the finished products in different packets in packaging machine followed by packing in cartons of different sizes and are distributed in the market for sale.

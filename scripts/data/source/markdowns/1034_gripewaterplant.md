1. INTRODUCTION Gripe water is a non-prescription product sold in many countries around the world to relieve colic and other gastrointestinal ailments and discomforts of infants. The original formula of gripe water contained alcohol and sugar in addition to sodium bicarbonate and dill oil. Present-day products do not contain alcohol and may contain fennel, ginger, chamomile, or lemon balm in addition to or replacement for dill oil. Some gripe water products still contain sugar, while others may contain charcoal. Gripe water is an over-the-counter herbal supplement available in liquid form and sold everywhere from drugstores to health food stores. Many brands market it to new parents as a remedy to ease infant gas and colic, among other baby ailments like teething and hiccups. Originally developed to treat fevers caused by malaria in the 1800s, gripe water’s usage has evolved. It was nannies and mothers in England in the 1850s who started using the original version which, notably, included alcohol as a remedy for babies with colic. Gripe Water contains ingredients like Sarjikakshara and Mishreya tail, which are very useful in guarding babies against common stomach problems like afara, aitten, indigestion, and acidity. Its regular use helps relieve digestive problems during the teething process of the baby.

In theory, these herbs should help ease gas, thus relieving the discomfort that is causing the baby to cry. Gripe water Soothes uneasiness caused by indigestion, colic, and flatulence. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- Raw material procurement Production Process Packing Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in; dust-free, moisture-free, neat, and clean environment. Production Process 1) Formulation: The formula or ingredients in gripe water vary by vendor. Oil, antacids, extracts and deionized water will be mixed to form the formula for gripe water. A formulation is a mixture of ingredients or chemicals that do not chemically react. This mixture of chemicals is designed to produce a final product with desirable characteristics. 2) Mixing: Automatic starrier will mix all the ingredients to form the gripe water and it will be stored in the storage tank. After production, Quality control will be done. And after quality control, it will be sent for packaging A general formula for gripe water is represented in the table below. *For 5 ml contains:

Where a product will be weighted and filled automatically and capped. Product labeling will be done after or before packaging. Testing Quality control 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 4000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.15,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.2500 Sq ft.

 Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 1000 Sq ft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sq ft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sq ft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery This is a semi-automatic type of plant and the production capacity is set to be 400 Litre of Gripe Water per day. Machines- 3.2.1 Mixing vessel Stainless Steel mixing vessel with a stirrer can be used for the mixing of the ingredients. A magnetic stirrer or magnetic mixer present in the mixing vessel employs a rotating magnetic field to cause a stir bar (or flea) immersed in a liquid to spin very quickly, thus stirring it. 3.2.2 Automatic filling and capping machine This machine is used for gripe water filling and capping. Using such an automated solution ensures that every bottle has an equal and consistent fill of the product. It efficiently completes the cycle. A fully automatic filling machine comes with a capping machine.

3.2.3 Sticker labeeling machine This machine is used for automatic sticker labeling. There are a set of principles that the sticker labeling machine requires to run the entire system of the machine. Firstly, the item/container which has to be labeled is kept on the sticker labelers at a particular speed of the conveyor present in the machine. Another working principle of the sticker labeler is that the technical fixture of the machine divides the items in a fixed space, and it allows the system to push the placed item to the aimed direction of the conveyor.

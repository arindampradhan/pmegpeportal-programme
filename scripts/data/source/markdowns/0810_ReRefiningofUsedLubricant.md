PROJECT REPORT ON RE-REFINNING OF USED LUBRICANTS Introduction: Indian crude oil normally certain higher percentage of wax and hence extraction of Lubricants oil from Indian Guide oil is uneconomic. Thus Lubricants Oils are imported to India either as finished product or as Guide Oil. Lubricants Oils are never destroyed. They only get contaminated by dust, dirt, carbon particles, moisture, etc. Such contaminated Lubricating oils can be refined and hence made equivalent or better than original Lubricants oil. Re- refined Lubricants Oils are prone to oxidation. Otherwise these are better than original Lubricants. Re-refining of Lubricants can also reduce the pressure on the Country by way of import of Lubricants either as finished goods or as Crude Oil. Bureau of Indian standards has IS:9048 for re-fined automotive internal combustion engine lubricants oil. Lubricants & Grease are not destroyed in nature and hence reprocessing of contaminated oil helps in reducing water pollution. Market: Refined Lubricating oil show almost the same properties as original Lubricants. Its colour is better than original Lubricants. With proper additives Refined Lubricants show better properties than original Lubricants. Refined Lubricants are normally blended with Original Lubricants and as base material for Grease manufacturing. Low viscosity & poor-point refined oils are used as transformer oil, Axle oil, Spindle oil, Hydraulic oil, etc. refined oils are by far cheaper than Original Lubricants as these are derived from used Lubricants. Lubricating oil manufacturing companies purchase quality Refined oils for blending in their factories. This is the best avenue for selling Refined Lubricants. Grease manufacturers & transformer industry also purchase refined lubricants. Thus there is good marketing scope for Refined Lubricants. Installed Capacity: It is assumed that the unit will operate for single shift of 8

hours per day for 300 working days per annum. Based on this assumption the annual installed capacity is estimated at 90,000 liters (60%)of Refined Lubricating oil by refining 1,50,000 Liters of contaminated Lubricants. Process of Manufacture: Used lubricating oil obtained in 200 Liter capacity Drum contain water and moisture. These are transferred by pump into a shallow dehydration vessel. The vessel is heated to remove water and moisture from oil. The moisture free oil is transferred to Lead Lined Acid treatment plant. Here ileum is sprayed on oil so that contaminants form a sludge and sink below the oil. Oil is drained from the Tap in the side of the plant while sludge is removed from the opening at the bottom of the plant. The sludge is treated with lime and placed inside moulds to form fuel bricks. The oil is mixed with Fullers earth and heated under vacuum. It is then allowed to settle for about four hours. The oil is then filtered in a Filter Press to separate activated clay from oil. The refined oil is prone to oxidation and discoloration and hence mixed with Antioxidant. Flow Sheet: Decantation Heating to Acid Vacuum Blending remove water Treatment Heating Sludge Block making Sales Sealing Packing Raw Materials: Used and Contaminated Lubricating Oil shall be the principal raw- material of the unit. Oil & Natural Gas Commission and Indian Oil Corporation are the principal generator of such Lubricating Oils. They sell their contaminated oil against tender. Various automobile repairing and servicing units also remove contaminated oils from vehicles. These are also available, through in smaller quantities. Other raw materials like 98% ileum, Fullers earth & Lime are to be purchased from sources outside the state. Chinabazar in Kolkata have a large number of suppliers of these chemicals. The requirement at the installed capacity and annual costs of raw materials are shown below: Item Name UOM Quantity of Unit Rate Total Cost Per Annum Raw Material (100%) 1 Contaminate d Lubricants Liters 1,50,000.00 10.00 15,00,000.00 2 98% Ileum Liters 14,000.00 30.00 4,20,000.00 3 Fullers earth Kilograms 9,000.00 50.00 4,50,000.00

The annual consumption of power is estimated at 39600 KW Hrs costing Rs. 87,318/- at the installed capacity. Fuel: The unit will use its own production of sludge Bricks as fuel. For better results annually 30,000 kilograms of coal shall be mixed with sludge Bricks. Water: The unit will need 1000 Liters of water per day. The cost of drawing the required water is shown with power cost. Manpower: The unit will need the manpower (table below). The chemist of the unit needs to be well experienced in Lubricating oil testing. FINANCIAL ASPECTS :

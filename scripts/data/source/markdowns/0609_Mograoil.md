1. INTRODUCTION Essential oils are highly concentrated substances extracted from flowers, leaves, stems, roots, seeds, barks, resins, or fruit rinds. These oils are often used for their flavor and their therapeutic or odoriferous properties, in a wide selection of products such as foods, medicines, and cosmetics. Popular extraction methods include Steam Distillation, Solvent Extraction, CO2 Extraction, Maceration, Enfleurage, Cold Press Extraction, and Water Distillation. The method of extraction affects essential oil quality by way of pressure and temperatures applied. Mogra essential oil is useful for wound healing, moisturizing, and nourishing the skin. Therapeutic properties of this oil include anti-depressant, antiseptic, aphrodisiac, anti-spasmodic, and similar others.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Essential oils are used to fight infection, oil contains hormone-like compounds, which initiate cellular regeneration, and work as chemical defense against fungal, viral, and animal foes. Despite their foliar origins, however, essential oils have a similar structure to some compounds found in blood and tissues, allowing them to be compatible with our physiology. Aromatherapy: It is the use of aromatic essential oils to benefit the body – in emotional and physical health and beauty. Science has discovered that our sense of smell plays a significant role in our overall health. Essential oil treats acne efficiently and inhibits the growth of bacteria in the pores of the skin. Helps regulate the excretion of sebum, reduces scarring. It provides anti-aging benefits by preventing wrinkles. Induces sleep with its relaxing impact, this has made it a common recommendation for an alternative treatment of insomnia. It helps to relieve various respiratory problems such as asthma, cough, sinus congestion as well as respiratory tract infections. Essential oil is used in many skincare products. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- Raw material procurement Essential Oil Production Process Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done. And it will be stored in a neat and clean area for further processing. Essential Oil Production Process Steam or Water distillation process can be used for mogra essential oil production. Water distillation extraction is a popular method for obtaining essential oils from medicinal and aromatic herbs. Additionally, it represents an environmentally friendly process. Delicate flowers would clump together when introduced to steam in the distillation process, so the most effective method of extraction in this situation is to submerge fragile plant material in pure boiling water instead. The water protects the extracted oil from overheating. The condensed liquids cool down and

separate from each other. The remaining water, which can sometimes be fragrant, is referred to by several names including hydrolase, hydrosol, herbal water, essential water, floral water, or herbal distillate. 1. Soaking: The petals are soaked in the container, which has water for preventing overheating and charring of the plants. A large container called a Still, which is usually made of stainless steel, containing the water is used here. 2. Heating: and then heating water with plants till the steam comes out. The steam will release the flower's aromatic molecules and turn them into vapor. Heating systems in the extraction of essential oils using water distillation are direct fire, steam jacket, closed steam jacket, closed or open steam coil. 3. Separation: The vaporized plant compounds travel to the Condenser. Here, two separate pipes make it possible for hot water to exit and for cold water to enter the Condenser. This makes the vapor cool back into liquid form. The oil comes out and goes to the condenser where the oil and water are collected in separation flasks. The oil collected in the top layer of hydrosol can be isolated. The aromatic liquid by-product drops from the Condenser and collects inside a receptacle underneath it, which is called a Separator. Because water and oil do not mix, the essential oil floats on top of the water. In this method, the extraction temperature always is below 100o C to avoid the evaporation of water and oil together. 4. Filtration: Collected oil will be filtered out and will send for QC. 5. Packing: After the quality check, the oil will be filled in containers by an automatic filling machine. Testing Quality control

3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 4000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.10,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.2500 Sq ft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 1000 Sq ft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sq ft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sq ft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery This is a semi-automatic type of plant and the production capacity is set to be 40 Litre of Mogra Essential Oil per day. Machines- Oil Extraction Machine/ Water distillation plant Essential oil distills equipment uses technology and chemical separation that can extract flower components efficiently by distillation. The small essential oil extraction machine consists of the following parts: extraction tank, oil-water separator, filter, receiver, pipe oil cooling system, layer plate distillation, vacuum system temperature, rack, matching pipeline, health level value, digital display temperature sensor, etc.

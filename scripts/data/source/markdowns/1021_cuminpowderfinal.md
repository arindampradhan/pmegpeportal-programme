1. INTRODUCTION CUMIN POWDER Cumin is one the earliest known minor spices used by mankind. Cumin Powder or ground cumin (also known as Jeera Powder) is made by powdering dry roasted cumin seeds in a grinder. This homemade powder might appear ordinary but it has the magical powers to completely change the taste of a drink or a dish. Known as Cuminum Cyminum, cumin is obtained from a flowering plant that is majorly grown in India, North Africa, and the Middle East. These cumin seeds are then dried and powdered just like chili powder is made from dried red chilies and then used in various cuisines. Prepared from dry roasted cumin seeds, Cumin Powder, Ground Cumin or Jeera powder has all the quintessential components of cumin and a roasted flavor that makes any cuisine in which it is used more palatable.

Not only is it good for your taste buds but it also helps you when you want to lose weight. Moreover, it also prevents diabetes, blood sugar cancer, treats insomnia, and is also good for the skin.

1. INTRODUCTION Ceramic Paints are a new generation of paints that contain very less amounts of VOCs and hence a healthy alternative to the other traditional types of paints. These paints over protection against the harmful rays of the sun and made in a way so as to last longer than regular paints. These paints, being devoid of VOCs are safe to be used around children. Being more durable than the other paints, these paints are often more costly than the other paints. Despite this factor, there are several advantages that are associated with the use of the ceramic-based paints. These paints create thicker and smoother wall finishes which are easier to clean than the regular paints. These paints can even withstand scrubbing without losing any sheen. These paints contain “Ceramic Microspheres” or “Microbeads” which are used as Paint Extenders. Traditionally, the Paint Extenders are made up of inorganic materials like Chalk, Clay, Talc, Barytes, Titanium Dioxide, etc. The problem with using these extenders is the jaggedness within the material that results in rougher finish. On the other hand, the beads in the ceramic paints, however small they might be are packed closer together and hence result in smoother finishes. Furthermore, it enables the paint to withstand harsh temperature conditions and also the growth of moss, mildew, and bacteria.

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Some of the most common uses of the Ceramic paints can be listed as below: 1. This paint can be used to paints the exterior and the interior surfaces of commercial places as well as personal homes. 2. It provides a beautiful sheen to the walls 3. It is useful is protecting the walls against the UV rays of the sun thus it does not fade easily. 4. The paint is also successful against molds and fungal growth on the walls. 5. It is protective against different kinds of stains such as ketchup, lipstick, crayons, etc. The global Paints and Coatings industry generates a revenue of almost 160 Billion US Dollars, while the Indian Paints Industry is valued at 7.1 Billion US Dollars as per the Fiscal Year 2020. The domestic paints industry has grown at a rate of 10.4 % from the year 2008 when the market was valued at Rs. 159 Billion to the year 2020 when the market has reached Rs. 520 Billion Dollars. Over the years, the decorative paints industry has grown at a CAGR of CAGR of 11.4 % against the Industrial Paints sector which has grown at a CAGR of 7.9 %. The Paints industries in India can be divided into two sectors: Decorative and Industrial Paints. The decorative paints consists of Interior paints/ Enamels/ Emulsions, Exterior paints/ Enamels/ Emulsions, Distemper, Putty, Wood coatings, Cement paints, Primers and Thinners.

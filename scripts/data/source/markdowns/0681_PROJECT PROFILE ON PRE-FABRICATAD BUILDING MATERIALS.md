MBI Project Profile on Pre-Fabricatad Building Materials Introduction : Prefabricated building materials made of cement concrete with reinforcement include door frames, windows, frames, frames, chaijahs, roof slabs, lintels, ventilators, wall partition panels, compound wall panels, cement concrete small pillars for compound wall, slabs for canal lining, tiles, personal linings, sills, trusses etc. The use of prefabricated building materials / components is gaining acceptance in mass construction and construction of houses for economically weaker sections for low cost houses and speedy construction. This eliminated the use of wood to a certain extent. Raw material required - Portland, sand, stone chips, high strength deformed, rods, M. S. rods & binding wire. Process of Manufacture: Generally iron or seasoned teak wooden moulds are used for the manufacture of precast products depending upon their shape, size, design and specifications. Cement sand and aggregate in proper ratio with adequate water are mixed in concrete mixer. The desired moulds are well lubricated and filled with concrete mixture to 1/2 thickness of the mould, then the metal skeleton and other wooden pegs are placed in the mould at desired spots of the mould so that the wooden pegs can be used for fixing the metal fixtures such as hinges, latches etc. later the mould is filled with concrete mixture and the vibrator is passed on the surface of the filled mould to ensure hard mass by removing the air bubbles and loose water. The mould is allowed to dry. After removing from the mould the precasted building material is cured for 21 days. After inspection, the product are ready for marketing. 1 Name of the Product : Pre-Fabricated Building Materials 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Worksheds iqn. msqtr.fst 400 Rs. 80,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 50,000.00 Water tank, Mould and Fixures, jallies and other equipmentes Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 130,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 210,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 340,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in 000) Sr. No. Particulars Capacity in tons Rate Total Value 1 Pre-Fabricatad Building Materials 1131.20 TOTAL 0.00 0.00 1131.20 4 Raw Material : Rs. 800,000.00 5 Packing Material : Rs. 5,000.00 6 Wages (1-Skilled & 2- Unskilled) : Rs. 144,000.00 7 Salaries 1- Manager R s :. 120,000.00

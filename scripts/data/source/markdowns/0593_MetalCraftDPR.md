METAL CRAFT UNIT Introduction: Even from early times the craftsmen of India have been known to be masters of metal. Their knowledge of metallurgy pre-dates technologies of many other civilisations and their skill at working metals is surpassed by few others. The traditional metal workers knew his medium so well that he could, indeed, be said to have been able to mix and match them and create alloys to suit every function. Not only that, but to fashion them so as to convey delight and create objects of enduring beauty. Metal Crafts (ancient) reflect human skill and ingenuity rather than the use of power devices. In the past, metal crafts were resorted to for making objects for rulers and nobles as well as for their subjects, for both religious and secular purposes. Today objects are made for wealthy citizens, the middle class, and humble households. While religious and secular demands remain constant, objects have become even more disparate in use and form to meet diverse needs. In India craftsmen use different metals like iron, copper, silver and alloys like bronze, bell metal, white metal etc to make a variety of items such as pots, pans, utensils, photo frames, sculptures of deities, mythological figures and animals etc. Items like doorknobs, taps, key chains, boxes etc are also made, using different metals. Metal Craft enjoys a special place in the handicrafts industry owing to the fine, intricate hand engraving on the metal.

Uses & Market Potential: The global handicrafts market has been up surging, due to the increasing interest of people in art and culture. A large number of micro and small enterprises have evolved in the developing countries in the past few years, where artisans from poor communities are involved in the creation of handicrafts. Their artworks are also valued on humanitarian grounds. With the advancement in distribution channels and increasing penetration of online retail, the handicraft products have become more visible and easily purchasable for the consumers around the globe. The key types of distribution channels for handicraft products are discount retailers, department stores, specialty stores, catalogue retailer, internet retailer, and independent retailer. The involvement of several non-profit organizations in promoting handicrafts business has not only benefitted the artisans, but also fuelled the growth of the global handicrafts market. The increasing travel and tourism is also supporting the growth of the global handicrafts market. The tourists on recreational tour are always on a hunt to collect souvenirs and specialty handicrafts from the places they visit. This has also led to the development of a large unorganized handicrafts market especially in the developing countries. Product: METAL HANDICRAFT Raw Material: 1. Brass and Copper 2. Brass/Zinc/Borax Powder

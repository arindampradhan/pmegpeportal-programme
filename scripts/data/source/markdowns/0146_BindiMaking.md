INTRODUCTION Aside from the beautiful saris and gold jewelry that characterize much of the Indian subcontinent’s culture, one of the most internationally-known body adornments worn by Hindu and Jain women is the bindi, a red dot applied between the eyebrows on the forehead. The term “bindi” stems from the Sanskrit word bindu, which means drop or particle. Because of the many languages and dialects spoken throughout India, it is important to note that bindis are otherwise known by many other names, including kumkum, sindoor, teep, tikli and bottu. Bindi making is a simple process with good marketing avenues and profitability. Women population have replaced traditional kumkum with the decorative designer bindi. Bindi is a small piece of velvet cloth with a suitable adhesive. ... Bindi is a consumable product and requires both rural and urban women. MAKING PROCESS  RAW MATERIAL The main raw material required for bindi manufacturing is velvet cloth. Other raw materials required are decorative items like various stones, beads, adhesive, glue, and other consumables. We may fix the price of bindi according to the price of the raw material and efforts put to create them. Additionally, we can make customized bindi. generally, people look for this type of bindi for special occasions like ring ceremony, marriage, etc. Generally, this type of bindi comes with semi-precious and precious stones. Moreover, we will need to arrange the raw material according to the specific types of bindi we want to produce.  PROCESS First of all, punch the decorative colored sheets. And then apply the adhesive through brush rolls. The adhesive is coated and passed through a hot air chamber for drying the adhesive. Then cut the sheet to form proper shapes of bindis by using punching machines. Finally, attach the punched bindis to release paper and then pack them in small printed folders.

MARKETING A Commercial Bindi Making project demands proper marketing and sales promotion activities. We will have to create a dealer network and approach to cosmetics market for selling of product. Online marketplaces are also very good options for selling bindi. There are plenty of dedicated marketplaces that sell handmade items. Also, we can promote different bindi designs on social media platforms like Facebook. Additionally, we can establish a small online store to sell the bindi.

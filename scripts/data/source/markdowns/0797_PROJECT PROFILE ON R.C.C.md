"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" Project Profile on R. C. C. Spun Pipe Introduction : Reinforced cement concrete spun pipes upto 1000 mm dia are exclusively reserved for manufacture in the SSI sector. These pipes are widely used for water drainage,sewerage, culverts and irrigation. RCC pipes are classified as pressure and non pressure pipes viz. NP1, NP2, NP3, P1, P2, P3 for use in specific conditions. These pipes are made from cement, coarse and fine aggregate, sand, mild steel and HT rods and bars. Process of Manufacture:The reinforced cage is first prepared on the cage-winding machine by hand process. The cage is then placed inside the pipe mould which is then hoisted up and mounted horizontally on the turn unions. It is rotated by driving shaft withvariable speed arrangement, the rotation is kept slow in the beginning and then the speed is increased. The concrete mixture for the RCC spun pipe is prepared in porportion of 1:2:5:2:5 of cement stone, metal and sand respectively. The cement concrete is fed into the moulds during rotation which spreads inside evenly. The time required for completion of this operation depends upon the diameter and class of the pipe. The pipes are kept in the mould for 24 hours. 1 Name of the Product : R. C. C. Spun Pipe 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.

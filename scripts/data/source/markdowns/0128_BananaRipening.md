BANANA RIPENING What is Fruit Ripening? Ripening is a process in fruits that causes them to become (cid:131) edible. The fruit becomes sweeter, less green and softer Ripening is associated with change in composition i.e. (cid:131) conversion of starch to sugar

---

## Page 3

BANANA RIPENING What is Fruit Ripening? However, all fruits do not ripen in the same manner (cid:131) On the basis of their ripening behaviour, fruits are (cid:131) classified as: -Climacteric Fruits -Non-Climacteric Fruits

---

## Page 4

BANANA RIPENING Climacteric Fruits are defined as fruits that enter ‘climacteric phase’ after (cid:131) harvest i.e. they continue to ripen off the tree / plant most ripened climacteric fruits are too soft and delicate to (cid:131) withstand rigours of transport and repeated handling these are harvested hard and green, but fully mature (cid:131) ripening is done near the consumption areas (cid:131) (we will return to how this is done later…)

BANANA RIPENING Climacteric Fruits Examples: Mango Banana Papaya Guava Sapota Kiwi Fig Apple Passion fruit Apricot Plum Pear

## Page 6

BANANA RIPENING Non-Climacteric Fruits These fruits, once harvested, do not ripen further Examples: Orange Mousambi Kinnow Grapefruit Grapes Pomegranate Litchi Watermelon Cherry Raspberry Blackberry Strawberry

---

## Page 7

BANANA RIPENING Ripening of Climacteric Fruits Now, we return to ripening of Climacteric Fruits We have seen that these fruits need to be ripened, post (cid:131) harvest, preferably near consumption areas Traditionally, this has been done with the help of (cid:131) chemicals such as Calcium Carbide

---

## Page 8

BANANA RIPENING Conventional Ripening Method Calcium Carbide used is industrial grade, used in (cid:131) welding applications. This is known to contain traces of arsenic and (cid:131) phosphorus ..…these are toxic and may be hazardous to health. Calcium Carbide reacts with moisture in the air to (cid:131) produce acetylene gas. Acetylene gas acts as a ripening agent ….but is believed to affect the nervous system by reducing supply of oxygen to the brain

---

## Page 9

BANANA RIPENING Conventional Ripening Method Use of Calcium Carbide is banned under Rule 44-AA of (cid:131) Po FA (Prevention of Food Adulteration) Rules, 1955. Almost all ripening (more than 99%) in India is done with (cid:131) Calcium Carbide.

## Page 10

BANANA RIPENING Ripening with Ethylene The only scientific and safe ripening method accepted (cid:131) worldwide is the use of Ethylene Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that the fruit itself emits (cid:131) as it ripens Exposure of unripe fruit to a miniscule dose of ethylene is (cid:131) sufficient to stimulate the natural ripening process until the fruit itself starts producing ethylene in large quantities

---

## Page 11

BANANA RIPENING Ripening with Ethylene The process is essentially same for all climacteric fruits (cid:131) The conditions - ethylene concentration, temperature and (cid:131) humidity, vary from fruit to fruit As an example, let us look at ripening process for bananas

---

## Page 12

BANANA RIPENING Ripening of Bananas with Ethylene For optimum quality, flavor, color and texture it is (cid:131) essential that bananas are harvested green, but fully mature, with little or no angularity The quality of the ripe bananas depends on maturity at (cid:131) harvest, the care and speed in handling, avoidance of chilling injuries, and ripening under optimum conditions

BANANA RIPENING Banana Color Chart

## Page 14

BANANA RIPENING Banana Color Chart 1. evenly green; common color after harvesting 2. light green; color of bananas treated by gas 3. more green than yellow; ready for wholesale supply 4. more yellow than green; recommended for retail outlets 5. ideal color for sale 6. fully ripe bananas ready for consumption 7. over ripe fungus effected banana

---

## Page 15

BANANA RIPENING Ripening of Bananas with Ethylene Bananas are received at the ripening plant at color stage (cid:131) 1 (refer color chart above) The product is pre-cooled to the pulp temperature of 18ºC (cid:131) After stabilization of temperature, ethylene is introduced (cid:131) at a concentration of 100 – 150 ppm Most convenient and safe method of introducing ethylene (cid:131) is through ethylene generators Cylinders containing 5% mixture of ethylene gas with (cid:131) nitrogen may also be used

---

## Page 16

BANANA RIPENING Ripening of Bananas with Ethylene After 24 hours, the chambers are vented. During this (cid:131) period the fruit starts producing ethylene by itself at the rate of 2 - 4 µl / kg·hr Ripening associated changes include an increase in rate (cid:131) of respiration from 20 to 60 - 80 ml CO2 / kg·hr and a similar 3 to 4 fold increase in heat production The product breathes in oxygen and gives off carbon (cid:131) dioxide Excess ethylene and carbon dioxide must be removed (cid:131) for faster and uniform ripening

---

## Page 17

BANANA RIPENING Ripening of Bananas with Ethylene The refrigeration system must be capable of removing the (cid:131) heat of respiration and maintain the temperature and relative humidity at desired levels The venting system must be capable of removing excess (cid:131) carbon dioxide in order to maintain concentration level of below 10,000 ppm

---

## Page 18

BANANA RIPENING Ripening Cycle Bananas are ripened to color stage 3 or 4 depending on (cid:131) mode of retailing for dispatch to market Depending on cultivar and market requirements, ripening (cid:131) cycle maybe spread from 4 to 8 days

## Page 19

BANANA RIPENING Common Myths about Fruit Ripening There are many wide spread myths about fruit ripening (cid:131) Media loves to propagate them with addition of (cid:131) ‘sensational’ findings Certain TV channels regularly broadcast programs that (cid:131) warn you never to touch a fruit let alone eat it

---

## Page 20

BANANA RIPENING Most Common Myths about Fruit Ripening Farmers harvest the fruit pre-maturely to realize “ahead of (cid:131) season” high price, or Farmers are afraid of glut in the market and want to sell (cid:131) the produce as early as possible, or Unscrupulous traders want to book profits as early as (cid:131) possible without waiting for the fruit to ripen naturally

---

## Page 21

BANANA RIPENING Most Common Myths about Fruit Ripening Whilst there are obvious questions about use of harmful (cid:131) chemicals to ripen the fruits The fact that climacteric fruits necessarily need to be ripened (cid:131) post harvest is completely ignored Post harvest ripening of climacteric fruits need not necessarily (cid:131) be called “artificial ripening”

BANANA RIPENING Indian Perspective Presently in India, green bananas are transported in bulk in (cid:131) trucks or railway wagons. There is no packing except nominal cushion provided by (cid:131) banana leaves. There is no temperature or humidity control. (cid:131) During transport, bananas inevitably get bruised and (cid:131) damaged. These blemishes are not easily visible at the green stage but show up in the ripe bananas. More damage /bruises are inflicted in subsequent handling (cid:131) in the distribution chain all the way up to the consumer.

BANANA RIPENING Indian Perspective

## Page 31

BANANA RIPENING Indian Perspective All this damage can be easily avoided if the bananas are (cid:131) packed in corrugated fiber boxes (CFB) at the plantation itself. However, this is not possible in short and medium term as (cid:131) banana is a low value fruit and the market will not bear the cost of box cartons. Western countries have shifted to the use of box cartons (cid:131) some 20 years ago and eventually this will happen in India as well in due course.

BANANA RIPENING Indian Perspective Crates In the mean time, ethylene ripening plants are taking a (cid:131) step in the direction of reducing damage to the fruit by use of plastic crates. Bananas are being unloaded in crates and remain in (cid:131) crates during the ripening process in the plant. After ripening, the crates are sent out to the market, thus (cid:131) reducing manual touching /handling significantly

BANANA RIPENING VISION 2020 India is the largest producer of bananas in the World with (cid:131) annual production estimated at 26 million MT This means, daily production and consumption of more than (cid:131) 70,000 MT If use of calcium carbide has to be completely eliminated, we (cid:131) require 3,500 ripening plants in the country with an average capacity of 20 MT per day

---

## Page 38

BANANA RIPENING VISION 2020 The Government of India on its part is doing it’s utmost to (cid:131) make it happen Ministry of Agriculture, through National Horticulture Board (cid:131) (NHB) and National Horticulture Mission (NHM) is offering attractive incentive packages to encourage the industry Generous capital investment subsidy is available for all new (cid:131) projects adopting modern and energy efficient technologies

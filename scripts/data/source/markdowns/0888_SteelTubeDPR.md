STEEL TUBE MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Steel pipes are long, hollow tubes that are used for a variety of purposes. They are produced by two distinct methods which result in either a welded or seamless pipe. In both methods, raw steel is first cast into a more workable starting form. It is then made into a pipe by stretching the steel out into a seamless tube or forcing the edges together and sealing them with a weld. The first methods for producing steel pipe were introduced in the early 1800s, and they have steadily evolved into the modern processes we use today. Each year, millions of tons of steel pipe are produced. Its versatility makes it the most often used product produced by the steel industry. Steel pipes are found in a variety of places. Since they are strong, they are used underground for transporting water and gas throughout cities and towns. They are also employed in construction to protect electrical wires. While steel pipes are strong, they can also be lightweight. This makes them perfect for use in bicycle frame manufacture. Other places they find utility is in automobiles, refrigeration units, heating and plumbing systems, flagpoles, street lamps, and medicine to name a few. There are two types of steel pipe, one is seamless and another has a single welded seam along its length. Both have different uses. Seamless tubes are typically more light weight, and have thinner walls. They are used for bicycles and transporting liquids. Seamed tubes are heavier and more rigid. They have a better consistency and are typically straighter. They are used for things such as gas transportation, electrical conduit and plumbing. Typically, they are used in instances when the pipe is not put under a high degree of stress.

Uses & Market Potential: Stainless Steel tubes are widely used in the dairy & food processing industries, heat exchangers, evaporators, cooling units, stock lives and condensers, such as those used in chemical digestive food liners, blow lines, evaporation pulp and paper industry, pharmaceutical industry production flow lines, aircraft tubing, hydraulic lines, air conditioning and pressurizing tubes, oil lines, electrical controls and switches, fuel lines, flexible joints & connections, exhaust turbine assemblies, oxygen tanks, stationary, etc. so there is a good demand of such products. The demand for steel pipes and tubes is increasing day by day, especially in the automobile industry. Seamless pipes and tubes are used in both oil and non-oil sectors in a wide range of applications as line pipes, casing pipes, production tubings, and drill pipes. Oil sector absorbs nearly 60% of seamless pipes, while some 30% are consumed by bearings and boiler manufacturers. Steel tubes industry is poised for a 30% growth in the wake of a growing demand in the infrastructure construction sector, mainly in scaffolding in buildings. The steel tubes and pipes industry witnessed demand from various domestic industries like real estate, construction, telecom, power, energy, entertainment zones, metros, airports and ports, etc. Key policy-led initiatives such as the urban infrastructure program under Public Private Partnership also proved to be a shot in the arm. The market environment for stainless steel tube & pipe is challenging at the moment. Product: STEEL TUBE Raw Material: 1. Steel 2. Sulphuric Acid 3. Packaging Material

Manufacturing Process: Fig. 1 – Process Flowchart Area: The industrial setup requires space for manufacturing unit. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small-scale factory setup is 2500- 3000Sq. ft. approximately.

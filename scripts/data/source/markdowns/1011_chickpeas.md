CHICKPEA PROCESSING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Pulses are the seeds of legume plants that are edible. Pulses are classified as dry beans, dry large beans, dry peas, chickpeas, cow peas, pigeon peas, lentils, Bambara beans, vetches, lupins, and pulses by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Pulses are one of the most cost-effective proteins available, and they are a favourite food for people all over the world. It's a fancy term for chickpeas, lentils, and dried peas, which are tasty and high in protein. While pulses are legumes, the word "pulse" only applies to the dried crop. They're dried legumes with one to twelve seeds in each pod. Beans, lentils, peas, and other small seeds referred to as lentils or beans are used. Chana, also known as chickpea, is an important pulse crop in India. It is a high-protein food that can be eaten as a seed or ground into flour. It is an extremely nutritious legume that comes in third place behind dry beans and peas in terms of importance. Desi and kabuli chana are two varieties of chana that are grown all over the world. The desi type accounts for 80% of global chana output, while the kabuli type accounts for the remaining 20%. India is the world's largest producer of chana, accounting for roughly 70% of global production. Desi chana is primarily grown in India and consists of brown split peas that are small in size and have a thick seed coat, while kabuli

chana is creamy white in colour and larger in size than desi chana and has a thin seed coat. Many nations, like India, South and Central America, and the Middle East, cultivate chickpea as a winter crop. It is sown from April to June in Australia and Canada, and harvested from November to December in both countries. Chana is grown in India during the Rabi season, with sowing taking place between October and December. The maturity period for desi chana is 95-105 days, while the maturity period for kabuli chana is 100-110 days. Harvesting takes place between February and April, when the leaves begin to dry and shed. Except in Andhra Pradesh and northern Karnataka, it is not a big crop in the southern states. Chana is India's most valuable pulse crop, accounting for 40% of the country's overall pulse crop. As a result, India is the world's leading producer of chickpeas. It is mostly used to make ‘dal' and ‘besan' in India (ground flour). However, owing to a high diversification of food preferences into vegetables and ready-to-eat foods, the value of pulses has declined in recent years. It is primarily grown in northern and central India, where it is consumed as "dal" alongside other cereals. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Chickpea is an important source of protein, dietary fibre, vitamin and amino-acids used for culinary purpose. It is used both for human use and for livestock feeding. This pulse is consumed whole, fried, boiled, and salted, or in the form of split pulse, which is cooked and consumed. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Processed chickpea is more hygienic and are processed in the industries in two stages: the first stage includes sorting/grading/cleaning/packaging steps after that the chickpea can be sold in the market or further processed by grinding steps.  Raw material procurement- Firstly, the unshelled chickpeas are obtained from the marker or the farmer for further processing.  Checking: Then the pulses are checked as many a times there are chances for the chickpeas to get destroyed during post-harvest storage.  Cleaning: Unwanted contaminants such as plant bits, soil fragments, gravel, weed seed, other crop seed, and shriveled, torn, or destroyed seed are removed from the dried plants. The physical distinctions between healthy seed, bad seed, and unwanted pollutants are used to clean and upgrade the seed.

 Sorting/Grading: Sorting/grading is done to check the uniformity of the chickpeas. Seeds are cleaned and graded using a winnowing process followed by a series of mechanical sieves. Indented separators, disc separators, gravity separators, spiral separators, and drum separators are commonly used in addition to air cleaners and aspirators.  Drying: Until storing the seed, it must be thoroughly dry. For short-term storage, a moisture level of 10-12 percent is optimal (up to 8 months).  Packaging: The product is finally packed to be sold in the market. The seed should be stored in polythene-lined gunny bags or in secure storage systems after drying (metal bins or earthen containers). To prevent dampness to the seeds, keep the bags in a rodent-free space and stack them on wooden planks (no more than five in a stack) away from walls. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities, cutting & filling area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small-scale factory setup is 1000-1500 Sq. ft. approximately. Micro, small and medium enterprises are engaged in this work accounting for the total manufacturing units.  Workshop Area- This area includes the machinery setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, and cutting, washing and mixing. Total workshop area is approx. 600-700 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials, tooling and die storage space and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 200-300 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space, canteen area, medical facility etc. Total workshop area is approx. 100 -200 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electricity Utensils Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100- 200 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs. 20,000- 30,000 per month.

3.2 Plant & Machinery This manufacturing unit will be automatic type and the plant capacity is set to 100-150 Kg/hour.  Grading Machine- This machine is used to sort or grade the chickpeas into uniform sixes and texture.  Drum Separator: They are mainly used to manipulate ferromagnetic or paramagnetic structures with high magnetic susceptibility and/or broad particle sizes. These separators can work in both dry and wet modes.  Vibrating pre-cleaner- Vibro-Cleaners are used in seed cleaning and processing plants to remove significant impurities such as stick, buck, and leaves, as well as minor impurities such as fine soil and sand, from good produce. They are used to clean a variety of crops including grain, seeds, corn, wheat, rye, soybeans, oats, millet, and paddy.

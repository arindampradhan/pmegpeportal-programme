INVERTER BATTERY CASTING MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The lead–acid battery was invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston and is the earliest type of rechargeable battery. Lead acid batteries have a low energy density, only moderate efficiency and high maintenance requirements; they also have a long lifetime and low costs compared to other battery types. One of the singular advantages of lead acid batteries is that they are the most commonly used form of battery for most rechargeable battery applications and therefore have a well- established established, mature technology base. Lead acid batteries are the most commonly used type of battery in photovoltaic systems. Lead acid batteries used in the RV and Marine Industries usually consist of two 6-volt batteries in series, or a single 12-volt battery. These batteries are constructed of several single cells connected in series each cell produces approximately 2.1 volts. A six-volt battery has three single cells, which when fully charged produce an output voltage of 6.3 volts. A twelve-volt battery has six single cells in series producing a fully charged output voltage of 12.6 volts. A battery cell consists of two lead plates a positive plate covered with a paste of lead dioxide and a negative made of sponge lead, with an insulating material (separator) in between. The plates are enclosed in a plastic battery case and then submersed in an electrolyte consisting of water and sulfuric acid.

Uses & Market Potential: A lead acid battery is an energy storage device that is used extensively in automotive, energy storage, and telecommunication industries and for several other purposes in various sectors, such as utilities, marine, manufacturing, and chemical & pharmaceutical industries. The global inverter battery market is projected to reach USD 52.5 billion by 2024 from an estimated USD 41.6 billion in 2019, at a CAGR of 4.7% during the forecast period. The booming telecommunication sector and expanding data industry, require a cost-effective battery storage solution to provide for backup power is expected to be the most significant catalyst driving the development of this market. India lead acid battery market is projected to reach $ 7.6 billion by 2023. Anticipated growth in the market can be attributed to booming demand for automobiles, in addition to increasing focus of the government towards boosting the penetration of electric vehicles in the country. Few of the major players operating in India inverter battery market include Exide Industries Limited, Luminous Power Technologies Pvt. Ltd, Amara Raja Batteries Limited, HBL Power Systems Limited, Southern Batteries Private Limited, V–Guard Industries, Okaya Power Private Limited, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited, Base Corporation Limited, and Racily Udyog, among others.

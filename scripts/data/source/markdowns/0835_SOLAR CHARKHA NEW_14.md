DETAILED PROJECT REPORT 1 INTRODUCTION : The overall objective of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is to provide employment opportunities to spinners /weavers/artisans /individuals/ entrepreneurs with remunerative wages through Khadi & V. I. activities. KVIC is implementing Khadi programme through the certified Khadi Institutions of KVIC. At present there are over 2300 Khadi institutions registered under Societies Registration Act, Trust Act, Co-operative Societies Act etc are implementing Khadi programme throughout the country. In order to extend requisite fillip and to help the sector to emerge as most potent employment provider, KVIC has decided to introduce solar power charkha for production of solar spun yarn through these Khadi institutions. The yarn produced in this solar powered charkha will be used to convert into cloth using handlooms already available with these Khadi Institutions. Looking to the low cost technology, production of yarn through solar charkha activities can easily be undertaken in the rural areas by the Khadi institutions. Training for a week on solar charkha will assist the spinners to operate the solar charkha at their dwelling place itself. Production Process The project captioned "Production of Solar Charkha cloth" envisages deployment of 10 solar power operated charkhas to one khadi institution. The Khadi institution already possesses infrastructure for production of Khadi using hand spinning and hand weaving process and arrangement for processing the grey cloth. The raw material supply for the solar charkhas will be ensured through KVIC’s departmental Sliver / Roving plants situated at 6 locations in the country. Beside KVIC’s departmental units the few Khadi institutions also possess the sliver / roving production facilities. They will also cater the need of raw material to the solar power operated charkhas. The yarn produced out of solar charkhas will be converted into cloth using the weaving implements available with the Khadi institutions and subsequent processing for finishing etc. Market Potential The change of climate has caused major concern about conservation of ecology and nature. Therefore, Government of India is encouraging to use non- conventional energy such as solar energy wherever possible. The products such as towels, bed sheets, pillow covers, duster cloth etc produced using solar yarn will be sold to Government departments, Railways etc with the support of KVIC. Basis and assumptions KVIC in its existing Khadi activities takes up production of Khadi cloth using hand spun yarn produced from hand operated charkhas. The hand spun yarn is made Page 2 of 9

| 1 | INTRODUCTION : |
|  | The overall objective of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is to
provide employment opportunities to spinners /weavers/artisans /individuals/
entrepreneurs with remunerative wages through Khadi & V.I. activities.
KVIC is implementing Khadi programme through the certified Khadi Institutions of
KVIC. At present there are over 2300 Khadi institutions registered under Societies
Registration Act, Trust Act, Co-operative Societies Act etc are implementing Khadi
programme throughout the country. In order to extend requisite fillip and to help
the sector to emerge as most potent employment provider, KVIC has decided to
introduce solar power charkha for production of solar spun yarn through these
Khadi institutions. The yarn produced in this solar powered charkha will be used to
convert into cloth using handlooms already available with these Khadi Institutions.
Looking to the low cost technology, production of yarn through solar charkha
activities can easily be undertaken in the rural areas by the Khadi institutions.
Training for a week on solar charkha will assist the spinners to operate the solar
charkha at their dwelling place itself.
Production Process
The project captioned "Production of Solar Charkha cloth" envisages deployment of
10 solar power operated charkhas to one khadi institution. The Khadi institution
already possesses infrastructure for production of Khadi using hand spinning and
hand weaving process and arrangement for processing the grey cloth.
The raw material supply for the solar charkhas will be ensured through KVIC’s
departmental Sliver / Roving plants situated at 6 locations in the country. Beside
KVIC’s departmental units the few Khadi institutions also possess the sliver / roving
production facilities. They will also cater the need of raw material to the solar
power operated charkhas.
The yarn produced out of solar charkhas will be converted into cloth using the
weaving implements available with the Khadi institutions and subsequent
processing for finishing etc.
Market Potential
The change of climate has caused major concern about conservation of ecology
and nature. Therefore, Government of India is encouraging to use non-
conventional energy such as solar energy wherever possible. The products such as
towels, bed sheets, pillow covers, duster cloth etc produced using solar yarn will be
sold to Government departments, Railways etc with the support of KVIC.
Basis and assumptions
KVIC in its existing Khadi activities takes up production of Khadi cloth using hand
spun yarn produced from hand operated charkhas. The hand spun yarn is made |

into khadi cloth using hand or pedal operated looms. In the existing khadi production activity enough number of spinner artisans required to operate the charkhas are not available. In order to expand the activities of KVIC, it is proposed to introduce solar powered charkha to attract artisans and create new employment opportunities in the rural areas. With this objective the instant project envisages initially for introduction of minimum of 10 Nos. solar power operated charkha each having 24 spindles (per charkha) in each Khadi institutions. The cost of charkha and minimum cycle of working capital will be provided to the Khadi institutions through PMEGP Scheme by Banks. The yarn produced through these solar charkhas will be taken-up for further production of cloth by the Khadi institutions and the finished products such as bed sheets, towels, pillow covers, duster cloth, uniforms, dungri cloth etc. KVIC through its Marketing Directorate will assist the Khadi institutions for supply of solar charkha cloth to Government departments, Railways etc. Financial Assistance Financing of Solar charkha units to be set by Khadi Institutions under PMEGP will receive financial assistance as per the provision of PMEGP with Margin money assistance as provided under PMEGP scheme. 2 ABOUT THE PROMOTER : Khadi institutions / Entrepreneurs 3 COST OF PROJECT : A.

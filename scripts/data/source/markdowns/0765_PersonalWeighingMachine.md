PERSONAL WEIGHING MACHINE MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A weighing scale is one of the most important accessories one should possess if he/she is health conscious. We all know the fact that “A healthy mind in a healthy body”. We have to keep our body healthy to have a healthy mind. But, during the past few years, people are more careless about their health and they don‟t prefer keeping their body mass in check. One of the main reasons is because they do not have any time to spare and they are not ready to sacrifice their time or control their diet. According to many experts, a weighing machine at home can make a user-health conscious; he/she can frequently check their weight and do a self-assessment. There are many people who have changed their lifestyle and have escaped diseases and obesity just because they did a self-assessment on the basis of their body weight readings. The main advantages of an electronic weighing system when compared with mechanical weighing systems are: (a) Compactness and small size independent of capacity. (b) Ruggedness and high dependability. (c) High speed of response and rapid weighing. (d) Good accuracy. (e) Excellent flexibility to monitor multiple loads. (f) Analog and digital with printout facility remote indication and parallel display. (g) Online processing through computer. The electronic weighing system comprises the basic load cell, suitable signal conditioners and output recorders/ indicators giving both the analog and digital output for further processing. The signals from the load cell are amplified and fed to analog/digital converter, which provide an output in the digital format for display/ printing/processing etc.

Uses & Market Potential: Need and Benefits of Personal Weighing Scales : The people are taking interest in how to remain healthy and how to lose weight. Weighing Scales are very handy can There is a variety of scales and these scales help to reach goal. These scales are also termed as personal scales and they come a long way and are equipped with many features that are easy to use. The digital Wi-Fi personal scale is an improvement in the area of weight measurement. Electronic weighing scales find use across several applications such as retail, healthcare, veterinary, laboratories, jewellery, and other industrial applications. Among the various application segments in the global electronic weighing scale market, the industrial scales segment accounts for comparatively higher revenue share of almost 33% and is expected to remain dominant during the forecast period. The health scales segment is expected to register high Y-o-Y growth rates throughout the forecast period while the veterinary scales segment is anticipated to increase 1.4X between 2017 and 2025. The health scales segment is projected to witness a CAGR of 5.2% during the forecast period while the gem and jewellery scales segment is expected to be a close second at 5.1%. The retail scales segment is expected to be the second largest segment, with a market value share of 24.0% during the period of assessment.

Product: Personal Weighing Scale Raw Material: Weighing scale of electronic /digital type are considered for project. The main components are load cell, electronic circuit, display unit, weighing pan, weight balancing mechanism and housing. The unit can procure load cells and all electronic components from market, for assembly as per design, while body and pan are produced in house. For housing and pan, raw materials required are plastic molding and steel sheets of various gauges. Manufacturing Process: The manufacturing process mainly consists of assembly.  Load cells are selected and sourced from reputed manufacturers offering reliability and durability. As per the weighing capacity of final machines, different type and design of load cells are used.  These load cells are connected with weighing pan through levers to equalize the load.  Load cell is connected with electronic circuit and display and/ or printer unit. The whole assembly is mounted in the housing or body of machine.  The machines are then powered up and the adjustments of load cell are carried out. The circuit adjustments of output are calibrated as per the accuracy range and weighing range specified for machine as per the prescribed process.

 The adjustments are sealed with temper proof seals and certified as calibrated scale.  These weighing scales are then inspected / checked for accuracy for full range of weights in the range specified for machine before packing and dispatch. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500-2000Sqft.

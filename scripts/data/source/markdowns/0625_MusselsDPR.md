CANNED MUSSELS UNIT Introduction: Mollusks are the invertebrate with soft bodies, divided into foot and visceral section. They are subdivided into bivalve, cephalopods and gastropods. The commercially important bivalve are mussels, oysters, clams and scallops. Mytilus edulis, Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis are the species that dominates global production. Mussels are ideally suited to aquaculture because they show wide tolerance of environmental conditions, are low in the food chain exploiting natural primary production, show high fecundity and productivity, grow naturally at high densities, and are tasty and nutritious and popular with consumers. The demand for protein rich food is increasing, especially in developing countries, stimulating the exploration of unexploited or non-traditional resources. Marine molluscs are. Mussels are sustainable source of producing dietary protein, omega 3 fatty acid, essential amino acids. The protein content in mussels varies from 12.6- 24 g/ 100g depending on the variety. Mussels contain little saturated fatty acid and significant amount of vitamin C. mussels contains approximately 20 – 28% calories from fat. For these reasons’ mussels can be considered low fat and high protein food. it is also a good source of calcium, phosphorus, zinc, iron and copper.

ELECTRIC TANDOOR INTRODUCTION: ‐ Tandoor is used to make not only tandoor roti but also non- veg preparations. The traditional tandoor was made by clay in which we used wood fuel to heat it up. Now-a-days people lead fast life. Every member of family is working and Electric tandoor is very handy and convenient. That's why tandoor preparations have not only become popular in whole of this country but also in hotels abroad. MARKET POTENTIAL: ‐ The demand for domestic electrical tandoor has been steadily increasing. As a result of the expansion in generation of electrical energy in the country, the electric energy does replace other forms of energy for domestic use. Tandoor is widely used by hotels, restaurants etc.

BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS i) The basis for calculation of production capacity has been taken on single shift basis on 50% efficiency. ii)The maximum capacity utilization on single shift basis for 300 days a year. During first year and second year of operations the capacity utilization is 50% and 60% respectively. iii) The salaries and wages, cost of raw materials, utilities, rents, etc. are based on the prevailing rates in and around the place of Unit established. These cost factors are likely to vary with time and location. iv)Interest on term loan and working capital loan has been taken at the rate of 11% on an average. This rate may vary depending upon the policy of the financial institutions/agencies from time to time. v)The cost of machinery and equipment’s refer to a particular make / model and prices are approximate. vi) The break-even point percentage indicated is of Average capacity utilization. vii)The project preparation cost etc. whenever required could be considered under pre-operative expenses. viii) The essential production machinery and test equipment required for the project have been indicated. The unit may also utilize common test facilities available at Electronics Test and Development Centres (ETDCs) and Electronic Regional Test Laboratories (ERTLs) and Regional Testing Centres (RTCs).

TECHNICAL ASPECTS: ‐ PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE Inspection of raw Fabrication of Fitting of mat erial Tandoor body element Checking, Electric Painting of inspection, connection inner and testing outer body POLLUTION CONTROL The Government accords utmost importance to control environmental pollution. The small-scale entrepreneurs should have an environmentally friendly attitude and adopt pollution control measures by process modification and technology substitution. India having acceded to the Montreal Protocol in September, 1992, the production and use of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) like Chlorofluore Carbon (CFCs), Carbon Tetrachloride, Halons and methyl Chloroform etc. need to be phased out immediately with alternative chemicals/solvents. A notification for detailed Rules to regulate ODS phase out under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 have been put in place with effect from 19th July 2000

ENERGY CONSERVATION With the growing energy needs and shortage coupled with rising energy cost, a greater thrust in energy efficiency in industrial sector has been given by the Government of India since 1980s. The Energy Conservation Act, 2001 has been enacted on 18th August 2001, which provides for efficient use of energy, its conservation and capacity building of Bureau of Energy Efficiency created under the Act. The following steps may help for conservation of electrical energy: i) Adoption of energy conserving technologies, production aids and testing facilities. ii) Efficient management of process/manufacturing machineries and systems, QC and testing equipment’s for yielding maximum Energy Conservation. iii) Optimum use of electrical energy for heating during soldering process can be obtained by using efficient temperature-controlled soldering and de- soldering stations. iv) Periodical maintenance of motors, compressors etc. v) Use of power factor correction capacitors. Proper selection and layout of lighting system; timely switching on-off of the lights; use of compact fluorescent lamps wherever possible etc.

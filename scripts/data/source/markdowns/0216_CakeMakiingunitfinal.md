1. INTRODUCTION Cake is a type of sweet food that is typically baked, made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients. Cakes were modifications of bread in their earliest types, but now cakes cover a wide variety of preparations that can be basic or complex, and that share characteristics with other sweets such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies. Flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents such as baking soda or baking powder are the most widely used cake ingredients. Dry, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with various substitutions for the main ingredients, are common additional ingredients and flavourings. Fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (such as pastry cream), iced butter cream or other icing, and decorated with marzipan, piped border or candied fruit may also be filled with cakes. On ceremonial occasions, such as marriages, anniversaries, and birthdays, cake is sometimes served as a celebratory dessert. Countless cake recipes are available; some are bread-like, some are rich and intricate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complex process; while considerable labor went into cake making at one time (especially the whisking

of egg foams), baking equipment and instructions have been streamlined so that a cake can be baked even by the most amateur of cooks. Two main types of cakes are available: butter cakes (also referred to as shortened cakes) and sponge cakes. The difference is in the fat content of these two broad types of cake. Of these big forms has countless variations. 1. Sponge Cakes-Sponge cakes have little to no fat and typically have a higher percentage of eggs. This gives them an airy, lighter texture (think angel food and sponge cake). When you bake sponge cakes, it is important to note that as soon as it is ready, the batter needs to go into the oven to prevent the egg whites from deflating. Owing to the raise the egg whites give them, they also need to be baked in a tall pan. These cakes are not going to hold up well against heavy frosting, so it's best to give them a dollop of whipped cream or a soft glaze. 2. Butter Cakes- On the other hand, butter cakes contain butter, margarine, or shortening of vegetables, giving you the dense, moist cakes that we know and love. If it says "cream butter and sugar," in the recipe, it's a butter cake. You'll usually add egg, flour, and baking powder or baking soda for leavening once the creaming is complete. To name a couple, butter cakes will come in chocolate, white, yellow and marble. Other cakes in this type, such as carrot cake or red velvet cake, can be "shortened" with oil

2. MARKET POTENTIAL: The global market bread product is divided by product type (Loaves, Baguettes, Rolls, Burger Buns, Sandwich Slices, Ciabatta, Frozen Bread, and Others), Distribution Channel (Convenience Stores, Specialist Retailers, Supermarkets and Hypermarkets, Online Retail, Variety Stores, and Others), and by Geography. Global bread market is projected to register a CAGR of 1.43% during the forecast period, 2019 - 2024. During the forecast period, 2019 - 2024, the global bread market is expected to register a CAGR of 1.43%. Since the nineties, the Indian bread industry has come a long way. For certain clients, bread has progressed from being viewed as a fundamental breakfast food item to being a confectionary item. Rising disposable sales, urbanization, and changing customer tastes and behaviors have provided the bread industry a boost over the years. The Indian bread market stood at $640.73 million in 2017, and is projected to rise to $1024.54 million by 2024 at a CAGR of over 10.70 percent, in value terms, during 2019-2024. Market factors and demographic patterns are increasingly affecting supply and demand; India's bread market is aided by an expanding working population and a rising number of health-conscious consumers. In addition, some of the other factors expected to propel demand for bread over the next five years are rising disposable income along with shifting lifestyle and knowledge of eating a good and safe diet to minimize health problems. The bread industry in India is dominated by unorganized players, leading to about 55% of the total market.

3. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 3.1 RAW MATERIAL The raw materials required for Cake is as follow:  Baking Powder  Castor Sugar  Eggs  All Purpose Flour (Maida)  Vanilla Essence  Corn Starch  Oil  RO Water Whipping Cream:  Whipping Cream  Icing Sugar Decoration, Icing & Soaking: (Optional)  Pineapple Juice  Chopped Canned Pineapples  Canned Cherry Usually, a traditional cake recipe contains flour, a kind of sweetener, eggs, some sort of fat, a liquid, a leavening agent to make it rise and flavour (like vanilla, cocoa powder or cinnamon). In order to create cakes of varying density, texture and taste, the ingredients communicate with each other. Here is how each ingredient functions:

3.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS  Ingredients scaling All types of raw material are Procured from the raw material store and transported by suitable material handling equipment to their respective holding tanks.  Mixing (hot/cold process) In the drum of the batter mixing machine, all raw materials are added in the amount needed according to the required sequence. There are different speeds for mixing various components and they are maintained to achieve the most effective batter features. This produces the cake batter.  Depositing The baking tray is appropriately greased with oil and a butter paper of appropriate shape i.e. shape of the bottom is placed at bottom of the tray. Then the cake batter is poured into a baking tray, followed by which batter is appropriately levelled.  Baking Bake at 360–425°F (182–218°C) to an internal temperature of 204°F (95°C). The hot processed batter should have a shorter baking time. The cold processed batter should be baked longer. The baked cake is obtained from the oven; it’s allowed to cool in the pan itself prior to de-panning.

 De-panning De-pan from the oven onto dusted paper pan liners while the cakes are still warm. The butter paper is then gently removed from cake, followed by which outer skin of cake is also removed with a knife, and then the cake is divided into multiple layers depending on the thickness of the cake.  Cooling Cool product to loaf internal temperature of 95–105°F (35–40°C) before icing and packaging.  Icing Simultaneously Whipping Cream and Icing Sugar are beaten by a simple beater until sufficiently stiff, which is then fed to holding tank of cake decorating machine. The layer of cake is placed on a cake decorating and icing machine, followed by the cake-decorating machine which uses the layer of whipped cream over the cake, then the layer of chopped fruit slices is placed and another layer of cake is placed over the pineapple layer. This is followed by a layer of chopped fruit slices.  Storage and Packaging or serving When all layers are added, the last layer is filled with only one layer of whipping cream and then easily decorated by the machine, then finished manually. The cake is in the refrigerator until it is sold at the correct temperature.

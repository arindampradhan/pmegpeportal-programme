NAIL POLISH UNIT Introduction Nail polish (also known as nail varnish or nail enamel) is a lacquer that can be applied to the human fingernail or toenails to decorate and protect the nail plates. The formulation has been revised repeatedly to enhance its decorative effects, and to suppress cracking or flaking. Nail polish consists of a mix of an organic polymer and several other components, depending on the brand. Types of Nail Polish Base coat This type of nail polish is a clear, milky-colored, or opaque pink polish formula that is used specifically before applying nail polish to the nail. The purpose of it is to strengthen nails, restore moisture to the nail, and/or help polish adhere to the nail so staining will not occur and the manicure lasts longer than without a base coat. Some base coats are marketed as "ridge fillers" which can create a smooth surface, and reduce the appearance of the ridges that can appear on un buffed nails. Some base coats called "peel off base coats" allow the user to peel off their nail polish without using a remover. Top coat This type of nail polish is a clear coloured polish formula that is used specifically after applying nail polish to the nail. It forms a hardened barrier for the nail that can prevent chipping, scratching and peeling. Many top coats are marketed as "quick-drying." Top coats can help the underlying coloured polish dry quickly as well. It gives the polish a more finished and desired look and may help to keep the polish on for longe. Gel Gel polish is a long-lasting variety of nail polish made up of a type of methacrylate polymer. It is painted on the nail similar to traditional nail polish, but does not dry. Instead it is cured under an ultraviolet lamp or ultraviolet LED. While regular nail polish

formulas typically last two to seven days without chipping, gel polish can last as long as two weeks with proper application and home care. Gel polish can be more difficult to remove than regular nail polish. It is usually removed by soaking the nails in pure acetone (the solvent used in most nail polish removers) for five to fifteen minutes, depending on the formula. Matte Matte polish is like regular polish, but has a purposely dull finish rather than a shine. It can be purchased as a regular base coat in ranges of different colors. Matte nail polish can also be found in a top coat. Matte top coat is most useful for painting over any dry base color, giving it a different appearance. The matte top coat polish will dull the shine from a regular base coat polish. Matte polish has become very popular through the years, particularly since it can be used in nail art applications, where designs can be created on the nail using the contrast of both shiny and matte surfaces. Description of Nail Polish Machine Machinery for Nail Polish includes the following:  Diluser Tank  Mixer  Filler  Packaging Nail Polish Machines are used to manufacture nail polish from different types of raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, filling & packaging completes in a very short span. Nail Polish Market Analysis India nail polish market stood at $ 88.6 million in 2018 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 10%, to reach $ 143.6 million by 2024 on the back of growing demand for nail polish and nail care products, increasing middle class population, emergence of brands such as Nykaa

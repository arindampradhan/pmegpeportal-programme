UTENSIL CLEANING POWDER Introduction: Cleaning Powder have wide applications in removing soil, dirt, oil, etc. from cooking utensils. They are widely used for cleaning purpose. Utensils washing powder is used to clean utensils. Previously ash and clay were used for the same purpose but for cleanliness and safety of hands, utensils washing powders growing demand is justified. Utensils washing powder are commonly known as Dish washing powder. The main action involved in removing dirt is abrasion action, but no scratches are to be formed by its abrasive action while cleaning is in progress. Uses & Market Potential: The use of utensils washing powder is steadily increasing now-a-days all over the country. This increase has been necessitated by extensive use of modern and sophisticated kitchenware like stainless steel utensils, pressure cookers, crockery etc; in many homes in the country. The standard of living of the people is increasing, so the use of costly and modern kitchenware will also invariably increase. This is not restricted to metropolitan cities but also to other big towns where the use of costly

kitchenware has of late, increased tremendously. The utensils washing powder has well demand both for household and industrial use. Raw material requirement: The raw materials required are as follow: 1. Oleum 2. Soda Ash 3. Water 4. Sodium Hypochlorite 5. Sodium Hydroxide 6. Dolomite Powder 7. Trisodium Phosphate(TSP) 8. Sodium Perborate 9. Other salts 10.

Manufacturing Process: Oleum and Soda Ash are drawn from their separate storage tanks in metered quantities and mixed together in a slurry mixer to prepare a thick acid slurry which is then feed to another slurry mixer in which its mixed along with water which acts as a thinner for acid slurry. This slurry is then feed to another slurry mixer; in which its mixed with sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide to obtain the required sulfonate slurry or the required acid slurry. The various other ingredients like Dolomite powder, Trisodium Phosphate (TSP) and various other salts are mixed together with prepared slurry in another slurry mixer. The prepared slurry is then held in a slurry tank which acts as a holding tank for heating tower. A set of pumps is then used to feed this slurry to the evaporating tower which essentially evaporates the water out of the slurry converting it into a powder. This powder is supplied to powder storage silo from where it’s feed to a powder mixer in metered quantity along with good oxidizers like sodium perborate. The obtained mixture is required cleaning powder which can be passed through a filter to remove large grains to ensure product quality. The finished washing powder is stored in a separate silo from where it’s supplied to filling and sealing machine of the washing powder. Thus the product is ready for sale. (Note: The process can be accomplished with two slurry mixers one for acid slurry preparation and another for final product slurry preparation.) Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20 Hp.

Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require.  NOC from State Pollution Control Board FINANCIALS

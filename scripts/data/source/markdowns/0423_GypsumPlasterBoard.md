GYPSUM PLASTER BOARD INTRODUCTION Gypsum board (also known as plasterboard, wallboard, gypsum panel, sheet rock, or Drywall) is a panel made of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) with or without additives and normally pressed between a facer and a backer (typically thick sheets of paper). It is used to make interior walls and ceilings. The plaster is mixed with fibre (typically paper and/or fibre glass), plasticizer, foaming agent, and various additives that can decrease mildew, increase fire resistance, and lower water absorption. Gypsum building materials are used in all construction types (residential, non-residential, new or refurbished), ranging from complex high-tech systems to easy to install products adapted for use by the general public. Gypsum board is widely used for internal walls and ceilings by the construction industry, and is a material of growing importance in the do it yourself sector. Gypsum board is also a common fire barrier used in house and general building construction. Commonly gypsum boards used in walls and ceilings, in moist areas, in exterior applications, for fire resistance and area separation and special systems.

PROJECT REPORT ON HONEY-BASED BEVERAGES Quality and Standards: As per FPO specifications Production Capacity: 6 lakh bottles of 200 m L cap./annum PRODUCT AND ITS APPLICATIONS Natural honey has been one of the man's earliest foods. Honey is mainly produced from flowers and plants that require insect pollination by honey bee (Apis mellifera). This is produced in almost every part of the world and can be consumed fresh or stored by canning or bottling. It is used in ayurvedic medicines, direct consumption sweetener, as an ingredient for cough mixtures, sedatives, etc. Natural honey is available throughout the country. Marketing of crude honey poses problems due to its unattractive appearance, presence of waxes, insect eggs, etc. Delicious ready-to- serve (RTS) beverages from clarified are consumed like fruit based RTS. Honey- ginger beverage makes an exciting and refreshing drink. MARKET POTENTIAL RTS beverages are usually consumed for quenching of thirst and getting instant energy. Honey-based beverages have good taste and flavour. Sensory evaluation of the product has shown a good acceptability among consumers. 1/5

Break-up of the activities and relative time for each activity is shown below a. Scheme preparation and approval 01 month b. SSI provisional registration 1-2 months c. Sanction of financial supports etc 2-5 months d. Installation of machinery and power connection 6-8 months e. Trial run and production 01 month TECHNICAL ASPECTS Availability of Raw Material Honey, the basic raw material is available in the country in four forms viz., extracted honey, section-comb honey, chunk honey and pressed honey. The other raw materials required are ginger, sugar, citric acid, sunset yellow FCF and sodium benzoate. All the raw materials are readily available in local market. Process of Manufacture Technology for the manufacture of RTS beverages from honey is available with CFTRI, Mysore. For honey-based beverage, hot sugar syrup is prepared by using sugar, citric acid and water. A known quantity of honey is added to the hot syrup and heated to the desired temperature. Fresh ginger is washed thoroughly, peeled, sliced and homogenized with a little quantity of water in a waring blender. The slurry is boiled with water for a specific time after adding citric acid. After setting, the clear liquid is decanted and filtered. The clear ginger extract is mixed with the syrup prepared with honey, sugar and water. This solution is heated to a desired temperature. After cooling, the preservative is added and mixture is transferred to a sedimentation tank and allowed to settle for 24 hours. The beverage is further filtered.

Pollution Control There is no major pollution problem associated with this industry except for disposal of waste which should be managed appropriately. The entrepreneurs are advised to take "No Objection Certificate" from the State Pollution Control Board. Energy Conservation The fuel for the steam generation in the boiler is coal or LDO depending upon the type of boiler. Proper care should be taken while utilizing the fuel for the steam production. There should be no leakage of steam in the pipe lines and adequate insulation should be provided. Production Capacity Installed capacity 6 lakh bottles of 200 m L cap./annum Quality Control and Standard/STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries. The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry. The act brought into force in place of the PFA is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "FSSA") that overrides all other food related laws. FSSA initiates harmonization of India's food regulations as per international standards. It establishes a new national regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as "FSSAI"), to develop science based standards for food and to regulate and monitor the manufacture, processing, storage, distribution, sale and import of food so as to ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board where ever it is applicable. 3/5

1. INTRODUCTION Banana powder has been discovered to be a "major carbohydrate and calorie source." Despite the fact that it is a low-protein source, the powder's beneficial components are "markedly superior to that of other fruits." The powder has also been found to be effective as a dyspepsia therapy. Banana powder is a powder created from bananas that have been processed. It's a common ingredient in milkshakes and infant meals. It's also utilised in the production of a variety of cakes and cookies. Banana powder is prepared from pulp of fruits after mashing and drying in a drum or spray driers. Then dried product is pulverized and passed through a 20 mesh sieve. Banana powder has been widely used in baby formula since the early 1900s as a means of keeping babies healthy. Along with dried banana "figs," it was called one of the "major industries of the West Indies" at this time period in 1916. Banana powder has taken the world by storm, thanks to its gluten- free status and lower price point than wheat powder. As food and beverage makers shift away from banana flakes and puree for the preparation of baby food and morning cereals, greater solubility remains a key selling point for banana powder. A colloid mill is used to make banana powder from processed bananas. The powdering of bananas extends their shelf life and lowers the cost of transportation for export and import. Bananas are a good source of vitamins C and magnesium, as well as antioxidants and carbs. Because it is gluten- free and a cheaper alternative to wheat powder, banana powder has taken the world by storm.

As food and beverage companies shift away from banana flakes and puree for the preparation of baby food and morning cereals, greater solubility remains a key selling point for banana powder. The colloid mill is used to make banana powder from processed bananas. Banana powdering extends the shelf life of the fruit and lowers the cost of shipping for export and import. Vitamin C, magnesium, antioxidants, and carbs are all found in large quantities in bananas. The food Industry currently represents the biggest consumer of banana powder where it is widely used in infant food, puffed food, seasonings, solid beverages, cakes, cold food, instant food, etc. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Banana flour/powder is increasingly popular as a gluten-free alternative or a source of starch. Because of its great nutritional value, banana powder is expected to increase at a rapid rate in the market. It is a rich source of fibre, carbs, proteins, vitamins (A, B6, C), and other nutrients. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacture of banana powder comprises a sequence of following operations. I. Pre-Treatment- Pre-treatments of bananas are necessary for right selection of banana, its variety, matureness, etc. and includes the following.  Inspection of Bananas: The bulk of the bananas are inspected for its right variety and immatureness. It is done manually. The bananas are put on a bamboo platform and inspected manually. The bananas should be fully matured but slightly unripe. Overripe bananas are rejected especially because they produce undesired powder.  Sorting: Sorting is done for the uniform size material. During this operation, bananas are Selected as per the size uniformity.  Washing: The selected bananas are washed either by spraying water at low pressure or by dipping in a tank of water. In both the cases, the damage of the bananas is prevented due to any jerk or pressure.  Peeling: Peeling of bananas is done by first dipping the fruits in boiling-water for 2- 3 minutes. It is done by immersing the few dozens of bananas at one instant in

boiling water. The bananas are taken out within 2-3 minutes and not more than 3 minutes in any case as the banana becomes very soft after few minutes. After dipping, the peels are removed by hand. Knife may also be used for peeling.  Trimming & Cutting: The pulp so obtained is cut lengthwise into halves or quarters, depending upon the diameter of banana, and spread in a single layer on slat bottom bamboo trays. II. Drying- For the drying, the trimmed bananas are placed on a drying chamber with slatted floor placed over a heater. In order to get a white powder, the slices are exposed first to fumes of burning sculpture for 20 minutes before drying. Drying is done by introduc ing hot air at 145o F from heater through the material spread over the floor and escapes through a vent in a roof or the chamber. III. Pulverizing- The dehydrated slices of bananas are then powdered in a pulverize. The mesh size is kept 100 to 200 or even more, depending upon the end uses. The banana slices after dehydration are fed into the hopper of the pulverize. The outcome of the mill is fed to a vibrating screen to separate coarse particles from the fines. The fines are collected in a container and the course are again sent-back to the mill. IV. Packaging- The banana powder is packed in the conventional containers, either water or air proof polythene bags or tin containers. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.40,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1500 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finis hed goods. Total inventory area is approx. 500 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sqft.

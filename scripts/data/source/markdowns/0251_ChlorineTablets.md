Majority of diseases has their root in polluted drinking water. Therefore, it is a major task to disinfect water before it is made available for drinking purposes. Chlorine tablets are extremely useful for disinfecting drinking water. Government is promoting many small scale entrepreneurs to take up manufacturing of chlorine tablets MARKET POTENTIAL There is a greater emphasis on providing potable drinking water. If the needs of rural masses for clean drinking water are to be met, many units will have to be set up in small scale sector to manufacture chlorine tablets, which is one of the best and low cost disinfectant. Government is encouraging entrepreneurs to take up this activity in big way. Therefore, many small-scale units can be started at different locations. The tablets can be sold to bulk buyers or to individuals. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: The unit will work for 8 hours a day for 300 working hours. The unit will utilise 60% of the installed capacity production per annum with 10% increase per annum

IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: The unit can be set up in 6 months time TECHNICAL ASPECTS: Process of Manufacturing : The National Environmental engineering Research Institute at Nagpur has developed a simple process for manufacturing chlorine tablets. Stable bleaching powder sodium carbonate, common salt and chalk powders in proportion are mixed in sigma mixer. After allowing the mass to settle for some time, it is taken to tablet machine. Number packs the tablets in plastic containers. Finally the label giving details of batch no. date of expiry etc. Is fixed and the bottles are supplied to market. As the tablets are corrosive, adequate protection is necessary for the workers by providing hand gloves etc. Quality Specification: As per customers specification Production Capacity per annum Quantity: 60lac tablets Motive Power: 3 HP FINANCIAL ASPECT:

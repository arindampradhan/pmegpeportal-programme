EXTENSION BOARD MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The term Extension cord means a flexible multi-conductor cord having an attachment plug at one end for plugging onto a receptacle (outlet) and a connector on the other end for attachment to a continuing cord” and can range from 3’ to 100’ in length. It’s an insulated, flexible electric wire fitted with a plug at one end and one or more outlets on the other, allowing one to plug in devices whose cords are not long enough to reach a wall outlet. The term usually refers as extensions, adapter cord, extension cables, extension cord etc. There are several types of extension boards are available such as Two-Pin, Three-Pin, Four- Pin, Five- pin etc. By Power rate, the extension board can divide as High Power, Medium Power, and Low Power. In other words, this board is nothing but the block of electrical sockets that attaches to the end of a flexible cable allowing multiple electrical devices to be powered from a single electrical socket. Extension boards are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Extension boards often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some extension boards protect against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles include strip, rack-mount, and under-monitor and direct plug- in. One can choose an extension board as per the number of slots, LED display indicators, USB port availability, cord length, response time for it to restart in case there is a power surge and absorption rating.

Uses & Market Potential: A great functional household product, the utility of a Power Extension Board is undeniable as it connects all electrical and electronic devices simultaneously and also protects them from electrical surges or spikes. Extension boards are commonly used for home and office purposes. The Extension Boards, by being a functionally integral part of power distribution system have vast demand. India is a developing country with a fast- growing population and the economic growth of the country and the demand for any essential item grows as a function of population. Electrical power demand also grows as a function of population and commensurately the infrastructural requirement in the power sector grows. This phased increase in the power distribution has by itself, necessitated increased production of electrical extension board, thereby creating a good scope for the electrical extension boards. The rapid increase in the demand for electrical circuit and connection drives the growth of the market. Product: Extension Board

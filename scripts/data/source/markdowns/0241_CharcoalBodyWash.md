1. INTRODUCTION Soaps or Body washes are salts of fatty acids that are used for the purpose of cleaning the body. The soap present in the body wash solubilizes particles and grime which are then separated from the surface by washing it. They also kill the micro-organisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils by enabling them to be carried away by running water. They are created by treating fats or oils with a base. Charcoal body wash or more specifically “Activated Charcoal” body wash contains activated charcoal as a major ingredient which has several properties. Activated charcoal is a fine, black, odorless powder that is made by superheating sources of carbon in absence of air. Substances that are generally taken to prepare the activated charcoal include bamboo, coconut husk, yellow peat, coir, lignite, coal, and petroleum pitch. It is called “active” because in this form, the carbon is processed to have small low-volume pores that increase the surface area available for adsorption or chemical reactions. The word “Activated” is also sometimes substituted with “Active”. Activated Charcoal Body Wash Activated Charcoal Powder There are different methods by which Activated Charcoal can be made. In the physical method, the material with carbon content can be pyrolysed in the temperature range of 600 – 900 °C in a muffle furnace in an inert atmosphere in the presence of argon or nitrogen gas. After this the carbonized material is exposed to oxidizing atmospheres (oxygen or steam) at temperatures above 250 °C, usually in the temperature range of 600–1200 °C. In the other method or the chemical method, the carbonaceous material is impregnated with certain chemicals. The chemicals are typically acids, strong bases, or a salt (phosphoric

acid 25 %, potassium hydroxide 5 %, sodium hydroxide 5 %, calcium chloride 25 %, and zinc chloride 25 %). The material is then subjected to lower temperatures (250–600°C). It is believed that the temperature activates the carbon at this stage by forcing the material to open up and have more microscopic pores. Chemical activation is preferred to physical activation owing to the lower temperatures, better quality consistency, and shorter time needed for activating the material. There are several benefits of adding Activated Charcoal to the soaps and body washes. The activated charcoal helps to draw out the microparticles such as dirt, dust, chemicals, toxins, and micro-organisms thus helping to clean the skin from within. This prevents the occurrence of different skin infections including acne. Activated charcoal also have “anti- bacterial” properties that may help to absorb microbes from the wounds. Due to their properties, there are different activated charcoal-based products that are dominating the market. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The use of the Activated charcoal body wash is use absorb the toxins, dirt, grime, oil from the body and kills the micro-organisms due to the presence of the Activated charcoal in it. The surfactants present in the body wash reduce the surface tension between the skin and the water. Water has strong surface tension which forms drops as a bead on any surface. This slows the wetting ability of water and reduces its cleansing property. The liquid soaps lessens the surface tension so that it can wet the body and thus clean the surface properly. Also, surfactants loosen and emulsify dirt and debris, dispersing it in water and allowing it to get rinsed away. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The major raw materials that are required for the making of liquid soaps are: 2.2.1 The surfactants are the “Surface Active Agents” that surrounds and traps the oil particles from the surfaces. One part of the soluble in oil while other part in water. When a body wash is applied to the body, the oil soluble portion aligns with the oily materials while the water soluble portion aligns in the water layer. When a number of surfactant molecules line up like this, they form a structure known as a micelle. This micelle has oil trapped in the middle and can be washed away with water, thus giving the shampoo its cleansing power. They are added to act as the foaming and the emulsifying agent of the soap. Generally the surfactants that are employed for the purpose are Sodium Laureth Sulphate, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium lauroyl isethionate, Disodium Cocoyl

Glutamate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Palmittic Acid, Myristic Acid, etc.,Secondly a thickener is required to attain a thick consistency of the body wash. Generally Nitrosol, Antisol, Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC), Microcrystalline Cellulose are employed for this purpose. Sodium or potassium chloride can also be employed for this purpose. 2.2.2 Caustic Soda or Lye solution, made by dissolving sodium hydroxide pellets in water. However Potassium Hydroxide solution or Caustic Potash can also be used for the same purpose. It is a modifier which is added to modify special characteristics such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide adjusts the p H of the solution. Citric or Ascorbic acid can also be used in their place. 2.2.3 The Activated charcoal powder is also one of the main ingredients but it actually falls under the list of special ingredients. 2.2.4 Sulphonic acid or sulphonate salts are added as the foaming agents. 2.2.5 Soda Ash or Trisodium EDTA either one can be added to remove the hardness of water so that the soap lathers well. These chemicals form chelate complexes with iron, magnesium, and calcium ions. 2.2.6 The foam booster are compounds that increases the foaming capacity of the body wash. These commonly include Texapon, Lauramide DEA, cocamide DEA, cocamide MEA 2.2.7 Conditioning agents are added to make the skin feel soft and to reduce the dryness of the skin. Some of the commonly uses conditioning agents are Glycerin, Sunflower seed oil, Dimethicone, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Quatemium 80, etc. 2.2.8 Preservatives are added to inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms as body wash is made up of water and organic compounds. Some of the most commonly used preservatives are Sodium Benzoate or Benzoic Acid, DMDM hydantoin (formaldehyde releaser), methyl and ethyl parabens, etc. 2.2.9 There are certain other agents which are added as special additives, such as colorants, fragrances, antioxidants, etc. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process for the production of Activated Charcoal Body Wash is as follows: 2.3.1 At first the thickener solution is prepared in a mixing vessel with a stirrer. The time required for mixing is dependent of the thickener taken. Nitrosol, Sodium and Potassium Chloride dissolves instantaneously in water while Antisol, Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC), Microcrystalline Cellulose take time to dissolve and sometimes they do not dissolve completely in water,

for example, microcrystalline cellulose dissolves in a 7-10% alkaline solution at 0°C that too after stirring for 1 hour. So the thickener is dissolved as per requirement. The sulphonic acid and the foam booster (texapon) can be added to the thickener at this stage. 2.3.2 Next is the preparation of the Caustic soda or Caustic potash solution. As the reaction of theses alkalis with water is an exothermic reaction so these reaction are carried out in Jacketed SS reaction vessel so that the heat dissipated can be cooled off. This may be prepared a day before as it requires time to cool down. 2.3.3 Now the thickener solution prepared previously is added to the alkali solution through an outlet while the solution is continuously agitated in a reaction mixer or a paddle mixer. The mixture will become thick after this. 2.3.4 The Soda Ash or the Trisodium EDTA is then dissolved in water in a mixing vessel and mixed well to form a homogenous mixture. This is then added to the alkali solution thorough an outlet. This neutralizes the solution. 2.3.5 Now the surfactants to be added to the alkali solution are dissolved in requisite water in a vessel and then agitated well. Then it is also added to the alkali solution with intense mixing. 2.3.6 This is followed by the addition of the activated charcoal powder and the contents are then mixed well again. 2.3.7 The dissolved colorant and other additives such as preservatives are added next and the mixture is stirred well. After this the mixture is allowed to stand for about 3-4 hours. 2.3.8 After all the ingredients are added to the reaction vessel, a sample of the batch is taken to the lab for quality testing. Physical characteristics are checked to make sure the batch adheres to the specifications outlined in the formula instructions. A group of tests are run that includes p H determination, viscosity check, appearance and odor evaluation. After the batch is approved by the QC, it is pumped out of the main batch tank into the holding tank where it is stored till the filling lines are ready. From the holding tank it gets pumped into the filler, which is made up of a carousel of piston filling heads. 2.3.9 At the start of the filling line, empty bottles are put in a large bin called “Hopper”. Here the bottles are manipulated till they stand all upright and correctly oriented. Then they are moved on the conveyor line towards the carousel that contains the body wash. 2.3.10 The filling carousel is made up of a series of piston filling heads that are calibrated to deliver exactly the correct amount of Body wash into the bottles. As the bottles move through this section of the filling line, they are filled with Body wash.

2.3.11 From here the bottles move towards the capping machine. The caps are also put in a hopper and correctly aligned. As the bottles move by the caps are put on and twisted tight. 2.3.12 After the cups are tightened the bottles are moved towards the labelling machine and are labelled there. 2.3.13 From the labelling area they are transferred to the storage area where they are put into boxes, typically a dozen at a time. These boxes are then stacked onto pallets and hauled away in large trucks to the distributers. The number of bottles at a time in these production lines can be 200 per minute. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work An area of 1000-1200 square feet is sufficient to set up an Activated Charcoal Body wash manufacturing unit.

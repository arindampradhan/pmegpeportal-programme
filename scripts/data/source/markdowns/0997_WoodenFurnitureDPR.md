WOODEN FURNITURE UNIT Introduction: The wood carving artistry is about 400 years old. The products showcase the skill of the craftsmen of the region and intricate designs and carvings chiseled on wood, mostly sheesham wood being the raw material of choice. The most common varieties used to make Indian handicrafts are teak, sheesham, sal, oak, mango, ebony and mahogany. Sandalwood, rosewood and walnut are the exotic varieties and are expensive and are used in producing fine pieces of furniture and decorative items. These materials may have revolutionized the furniture industry, but wood is undeniably a staple material in furniture manufacturing. Wood is, of course, a long-lasting and robust material and is the perfect choice for anyone looking for longevity from their furniture. Wooden furniture can also go a long way to creating a sense of the natural world indoors. The export of these wood carving furniture and handicraft products is carried out by exporting units in the district. The wood items manufactured here include household items such as doors, charms, beds and wooden figures like toys and other artworks. India is a land of wonderful and marvelous artistic work of wood. The rich handicraft and beautiful traditional attributes of art and design have established a reputation of Indian Furniture Industry in the nation and worldwide. Furniture refers to the movable objects that support various human activities such as seating, eating and sleeping. They are also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work or to store things. Furniture is a product of design and it is also considered as a form of decorative art. Over 11.5 per cent of the total land of the district is covered by forest which offer very good potential for forest based industries.

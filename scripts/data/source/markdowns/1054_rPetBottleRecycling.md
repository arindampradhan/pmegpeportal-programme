‘Plastic Recycling Unit(r PET Bottle)’ Executive Summary PET-bottles more and more replace glass bottles in the beverage and food sector. The success of PET in comparison to glass is based on several economic (and environmental) advantages. On the one hand, the production of PET is less expensive and energy consuming than the production of glass. Secondly, the light weight of the PET-bottle makes it easier for merchants and consumers to handle the bottles and crates. It saves energy during transport, particularly on long distance haulage. Finally, PET offers more or less the same material properties as glass regarding hygiene, taste and gas impermeability. The consumption of bottled water has been increased very much in the past few years. Plastics are significant and make a positive contribution with regards to packaging in various ways. By sorting and processing plastic packaging that is found in predominantly homogeneous streams, the value and market availability is maximized for the collected plastic packaging industry. Plastic bottles, plastic tubs, and plastic bags all have the potential to be recycled. One of the fastest growing types of collected plastic materials for recycling is polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") from post- consumer beverage and water bottles. For beverages and other juices, plastic bottles

are used more preferably. The growing utilization of plastics in industrial and consumer applications, combined with increased consumer awareness surrounding solid waste recycling, has led to an increased demand for recycled plastic resins and products. One of the fastest growing types of collected plastic materials for recycling is polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") from post-consumer beverage and water bottles. Replay Plastics will capitalize on the opportunities in the recycled resin. Project Profile Poly-Ethylene Terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used plastics today. PET bottles are ubiquitous in our day-to-day lives–one has to just look around to spot a PET bottle containing mineral water or soft drink or used for other applications. PET bottles, post use, still carry a lot of value, and recycled PET (r-PET) can be used in a wide variety of applications. This makes post-consumer PET bottles a very sought after item by waste collectors. Discarded PET bottles fetch waste collectors Rs. 14-15/kg. These bottles are bought by kabadiwallahs or waste traders, who employ people to segregate, sort and further sell it to large vendors or recyclers. The caps, neck rings, labels (non- PET components) are removed, and the bottles are shredded, washed, and sold as what is called ‘washed flakes’. These washed flakes are then used to make (predominantly) polyester fiber, which is used as filling material for cushions, pillows, and converted to fabrics for use in clothing, upholstery, etc. These end products sell at anywhere between Rs. 50-110/kg; the market for r-PET products is quite large. There are 40+ large manufacturers across India who uses r-PET as raw material. The PET recycling business can be estimated (roughly) to be around Rs. 3,000- 4,000 crore in a given year in India. PPrroojjeecctt BBrriieeff This document provides details for setting up discarded pet bottle recycling plant . The unit will have the capacity to produce approximately of 1600 kg plastic chips (granules) per day on single shift basis.

initially the project would easily be able to produce and sell the quantity, which is required for the project to be economically viable. . PPrrooppoosseedd LLooccaattiioonn Most of the plastic recycling units can be established in or near major cities where source of Raw material is available in abundance. Key Success Factors The key to success of this project is in manufacturing good quality plastic chips . Quality standards should be followed strictly. Strong presence in the domestic market. Traders/Wholesalers are already present in the local Market. Tools & equipments locally available at low price. Raw materials are available in sufficient quantity and consumers of the plastic chips are available. (As per Annexure) Market Potential Polyethylene terephthalate or PET (also known as PETE) is one of the most common types of plastic. Most single-serve plastic bottles, including those for water, soft drinks and juices, are made with PET. PET recycling is the process of reprocessing plastic that already has been used before and giving it some new reusable form. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables. Recycling of PET bottles has grown to become an Rs 3,500-crore industry and nearly 70 per cent of PET waste is reprocessed in the country and growing at an annual growth rate of 29.9%. Nearly 70% of polyethylene terephthalate bottles are recycled in India, and the market is worth an estimated to be Rs. 3,000- 4,000 crore per year. India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.19% during the period 2018-2022. Entrepreneurs who invest in this project will be successful. Potential Risks Unavailable or scarce raw material feed stock for production • Replay is confident that it has secured good availability of low cost post-consumer PET bottles (feed stock) derived from post-consumer beverage bottles from California based recycling collectors, and has back up sources identified. The Company may not be able to sell all of its production capability • Through the Senior Management's industry-wide contacts, the Company has identified potential customers and received commitments for all of the production potential of the initial facility. The Company currently has commitments from customers to purchase all of the initial

production capacity. Excess flake will be sold to outside customers. Freight is a major cost of operations; proximity to source of supply and markets is crucial. Hauling plastic materials is expensive so entrants will have to consider establishing facilities close to materials and markets. Entrants with existing operations would have to consider new separate facilities in many cases, reducing economies of scale and making management more difficult. These industry-wide relationships will also provide the Company the ability to secure contracts for the supply of its raw material at competitive pricing. Value Chain of PET Recycling There are a large number of people involved in the PET recycling business, starting from the waste collectors and kabadiwallahs to the small and medium traders, recyclers, and manufacturers who use recycled PET for various products. The chart above provides a simplistic illustration of the participants in the PET recycling business in India. Step 1: Reaching the waste stream, getting collected. There are various ways in which PET bottles reach the waste stream for recycling. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one main source. All plastic items are separated from MSW and sold to a kabadiwallah who specializes in plastic waste. Waste collectors also go directly to the sources (railway stations, airports, restaurants, hotels, and kiosks) to

collect. As long as PET bottles are segregated (along with the dry waste) and discarded, there is a high likelihood that they will be picked up and recycled. There are some aspects that set PET bottles apart vis-à- vis other plastic waste. First, PET bottles are easily distinguishable, hence easy to pick up, sort, store etc. And weight per bottle (empty) is reasonably high for the waste collectors to invest their resources to collect them (as compared to extremely low weight, small size waste, like chocolate wrappers). There are 40+ large scale manufacturing units all over India that use recycled PET (washed flakes) as raw material. Hence there is a healthy demand for recycled PET. A kilogram of post-consumer PET bottles fetch the waste collectors Rs 14- 15/kg (prices vary from time to time; this price point was recorded when interviews were conducted between May-Aug 2016). Step 2: Sorting at the Kabadiwallahs. The kabadiwallahs get mixed-plastic waste. They run sorting operations, where people sort the waste into polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), milky PP, HDPE, LDPE, PET\ etc. This is done mostly by visual inspection, by subjecting the plastic item to a series of improvised tests like touch, bending, snapping, applying solvents etc. The different plastics are segregated and sold to different traders. The kabadiwallahs get Rs 24-25/kg of PET bottles. Step 3: Removing non-PET components, sorting, baling at the traders. Traders receive anywhere between a few hundred kgs. to a few tons of PET bottles a day. Each and every PET bottle is scrutinized rigorously, through manual inspection. First, all coloured PET bottles (green, amber) are segregated and sold separately. Metal caps, rings (a feature common in PET bottles used for packaging liquor etc.) are removed by hand. There are many kinds of labels applied on PET bottles—PP, PVC etc. PVC labels pose a particular problem, as they could seriously jeopardize the fiber manufacturing process. [PVC and PET have a similar density, hence it is difficult to

separate by flotation; but PVC and PET have different Internal Viscosities, which makes it very difficult to process PET contaminated with PVC.] Hence all PVC labels (identified by sight) are removed. Bottles made from other plastics are removed. Once all this is done, the bottles are baled—i.e., crushed to make compact bundles, each weighing 120- 140 kgs. Baling makes it possible to transport PET bottles efficiently—by making it possible to transport 8-9 tons in a full-scale truck. Each baling machine can bale around 0.7-1 ton of PET bottles in a day. It takes approximately ten workers (sorters, packers, balers) to produce a ton of baled PET bottles in a day. The traders procure at Rs. 24-25 per kg. And they incur around 4 Rs. per kg as costs in sorting and baling (costs include labour, electricity, packing costs, rent, and ‘shortage’. Many PET bottles when they arrive at the trader may contain non-trivial amounts of residual liquids (water, juices, other beverages, liquids stored in the bottle). Some of these liquids are emptied during the sorting process. Some of the liquids are crushed out during the baling process—all of which causes a loss in weight of the PET bottles- shortage is the term used to denote this loss. The traders sell to the recyclers at Rs. 30- 31 per kg (for white PET bottles; green bottles yield a slightly lower rate; amber PET bottles yield even lower). Step 4: At the PET recyclers—sorting (once again), cleaning, flaking. Trucks carrying bales of PET bottles arrive at the recyclers. The bales are opened and the sorting, cleaning process starts all over again. The bottles are put through various stages of manual, semi-automatic and automatic sorting, cleaning processes. All PVC labels, bottles are removed. Any metal component that might have slipped in (like caps, rings, springs used in spray bottles etc.) are diligently removed. The bottles are

shredded, and the plastic (non- PVC plastics like PE, PP) components are separated by flotation. The flakes are subjected to further washing, drying and are ready (washed flakes) to be shipped to the manufacturing units. Step 5: At the manufacturers – turned into polyester fibers The washed flakes are melted and spun into fibers of various grades, and used to make PET sheets, monofilament, strap etc. Manufacturing Process: - Recycling of plastic scrap involves basically grinding, washing, and drying activity. A semi-automated plant will be installed for the same. Initially this unit will purchase plastic scraps of different types and then the sorting process starts where the plastics are sorted manually according to the description i.e. PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP, etc Most plastic products come with a code on the bottom, this code determines if and how this product can be recycled. Before being recycled the plastic is sorted by a Plastic Identification Code and number; there are 7 classifications for plastic. For the purpose of our project only PET (Arrowed 1 )is considered.

Thereafter grinding process starts where different types of sorted plastic scraps are grinded into small granules/ chips. Then the washing process starts where plastic granules are washed completely to remove dirt and at last it is dried. Then the plastic granules/chips are packed in gunny bags of 100 kg approx and are ready for dispatch. The total process can be described in the flow chart as below:- Flow Chart Plastic Collection Manual Sorting Grinding/Chipping Washing Drying Sorted, clean plastic Granules

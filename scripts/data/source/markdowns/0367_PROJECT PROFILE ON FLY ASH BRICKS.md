MBI Project Profile on Fly Ash Bricks Introduction : INTRODUCTION Fly Ash bricks are made of fly ash, lime, gypsum and sand. These can be extensively used in all building constructional activities similar to that of common burnt clay bricks. The fly ash bricks are comparatively lighter in weight and stronger than common clay bricks. Since fly ash is being accumulated as waste material in large quantity near thermal power plants and creating serious environmental pollution problems, its utilisation as main raw material in the manufacture of bricks will not only create ample opportunities for its proper and useful disposal but also help in environmental pollution control to a greater extent in the surrounding areas of power plants. In view of superior quality and eco-friendly nature, and government support the demand for Fly Ash Bricks has picked up. Process of Manufacture: Fly ash, lime sand and gypsum are manually fed into a pan mixer where water is added in the required proportion for intimate mixing. The proportion of the raw material is generally in the ratio 60-80% of fly ash 10-20% lime, 10% Gypsum and 10% sand, depending upon the quality of raw materials. After mixing, the mixture is shifted to the hydraulic/mechanical presses. The bricks are carried on wooden pellets to the open area where they are dried and water cured for 21 days. The bricks are tested and sorted before dispatch. 1 Name of the Product : Fly Ash Bricks 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.mts 615 Rs. 600,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 855,000.00 Pan mixer 20 HP motor), Hydraulic Press (30 Tones Cap.), Belt Conveyor (Run by 3 HP motor) Deep Tube Well, Generator ,Steel Plates and - L.

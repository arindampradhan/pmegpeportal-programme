UPVC PIPE Introduction: Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (u PVC), also known as rigid PVC, Pipes & Fittings are used for all plumbing purposes in residential & commercial buildings. Ideally suited for looping at each floor level, outdoor installations & concealed pipelines for cold water distribution. u PVC is known as having strong resistance against chemicals, sunlight & oxidation from water. u PVC is widely used in construction because it is durable, cheap and easily worked. The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for window frames and sills when installing double glazing in new buildings, or to replace older single-glazed windows. Other uses include fascia, and siding or weather boarding. This material has almost entirely replaced the use of cast iron for plumbing and drainage, being used for waste pipes, drain pipes, gutters and down spouts. u PVC does not contain phthalates, since those are only added to flexible PVC, nor does it contain BPA.

Difference between u PVC and PVC: PVC is poly(vinyl chloride) polymer usually containing plasticizer plus some other additive (fillers, lubricants, stabilizers, …), whereas, UPVC is unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride), without any added plasticizing agent or with a small amount, but including other additives. UPVC is harder than PVC due to absence of plasticizer. It is used to produce hard products, like windows frames and pipes. That is their main difference, but their similarity is that both are poly (vinyl chloride), same base polymer. Applications:  Water Supply: u PVC pipes are the best for water supply scheme, such as water supply distribution network, main line, casing for tube work and raising main for handpump.  Chemical Industries: u PVC is very good for transporting of chloride acid and other chemicals.  Sewer Systems: u PVC pipe of larger diameter can be used for sewer system.  Cable Conduits: u PVC pipe is most suitable as electrical conduits.  Agriculture: u PVC pipe is very suitable for agriculture purposes such as for irrigation sprinkling pipe for farm land & other purposes.  Crude oil lines: u PVC pipe resist corruption, the deposit build up process is also difficult which result the low friction rate and thus making u PVC pipe the most suitable for the crude oil line. Machines & equipments: Basic machines & equipments are: Name Unit Price Extruder 1 950000 Mixer 1 70000 Cut of machine 1 42350 Inject printing machine 1 40000

Hopper & feeder 1 132000 Cooling tank 1 120000 Other equipments 4 0 565 Raw material requirements: Major raw material are as follows: 1. PVC Resins 2. Stabilizers 3. Other Additives Manufacturing Process: The various raw materials are procured from vendors and stored in raw material inventory as per production requirement, form where they are brought to manufacturing unit, where they are fed to mixer in appropriate quantity as per type of UPVC Pipe which is to be made. The raw material blend is fed to the extruder via a hopper and feeder arrangement which simply melts the raw material blend which is mostly PVC resin into a semi solid state which is then extruded into a continuous pipe by forcing it against the die and mandrel arrangement. If a thin walled tube is to be produced then this continuous tube is fed to a tube drawing machine which further reduces it’s wall thickness followed by which its moved via cooling tank where water bath cools of the pipe. A Inject Printing machine prints the required information onto the pipe at fixed interval as per the length of the pipe. The continuous Pipe is then simply cut in required length by a cut-off machine and are ready for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also

some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1200Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs.(Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator and 1 unskilled worker , 1 Helper, 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require

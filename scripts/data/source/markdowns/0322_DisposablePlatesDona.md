Disposable Paper Plates & Dona Product & Applications Disposable paper plates and saucers as the name suggests are made out of special quality paper reinforced with polythene sheets to make it leak proof. These products are conveniently used for serving eatables during family functions, eating chats and snacks, fruits, sweets etc. Most of the sweet shops use it for serving their customers with dry as well as wet sweets/ namkeens. The caterers utilize it during parties and social functions. These are a convenient replacement for crockery and utensils. These have many advantages over conventional crockery/ steel utensils. Whereas conventional utensils need care in handling, have to be cleaned before and after use need lot of space for storage and are difficult to handle these products are light in weight, are disposable after use, cheaper and can be stored easily. These are very cheap as compared to convention utensils. The paper plates and bowls are made by fusing two layers of good quality paper with a sheet of polythene. The product can be in any desired shape and size depending upon the die employed for manufacture. The quality of paper used is generally of importance as it should be firm enough to maintain the shape and hold the weight of the eatable served in it. Market Potential These products have an urban as well as rural market. These products are mostly used during social functions, religious gatherings, parties, marriages, outings, in sweet shops, by caterers etc. The products have many advantages and are hence preferred as compared to standard utensils/crockery for serving eatables. They can easily be disposed off after use and hence save a lot of labour as far as cleaning/drying of utensils are concerned. These are easily transportable and easy to handle. In our country people are religious and organize functions throughout the year all such occasions call for social gathering and celebrations with meals, snacks sweets being served. Further, our vast population organizes marriages, celebrates birthdays and other family functions on a regular basis. Sweet shops and small eateries can be found at every street corner and all such joints use these disposable plates and bowls. Thus keeping in view the culture of the people and the habits there is a vast market for the products not only in urban areas but also in rural areas.

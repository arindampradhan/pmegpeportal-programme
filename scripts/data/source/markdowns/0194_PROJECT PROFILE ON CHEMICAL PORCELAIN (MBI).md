MBI PROJECT PROFILE ON CHEMICAL PORCELAIN (MBI) Introduction : Chemical Porcelainis a white citrified dense translucent body with or without glaze made of china clay, quartz, feldspar, talk and additives in different shapes of thin walled items. These products are being used in the laboratories of educational institutions, scientific development and industrial research, chemical, fertilizer and petrol chemical establishments etc. Raw materials required for production of Chemical Porcelain are china clay, ball clay, feldspar, bauxite, zircon sand, quartz, fire clay, chemicals etc. Process of Manufacture: The hard lumps of quartz, feldspar etc. are crushed & mixed with china clay, talk in a suitable proportions with requisite quantity of water in the bunger. The slurry is passed through vibrating screen and magnetic separators for removal of grit and iron particles, if any, & sent to agitators. The slurry is pumped into the filter press where the water is separated & filtered body is formed into cakes. The cakes so formed are then transferred to de airing pugg mill for through pugging and extrusion into dense homogeneous plastic mass free from air bubbles. The extruded body is then shaped into required products by pressing jiggering slip casting methods depending upon the size, shape & properties, of the end products. The shaped articles are dried, finished & biscuit 1 Name of the Product : CHEMICAL PORCELAIN 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.ft Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 65,000.00 Jaw crusher, Ball Mill, Screw blunger, Electromagnetic separator, Agitator, Filter press, Diaphragm pump, De-airing pugmill, Vibration screen, Jigger and Jolley.

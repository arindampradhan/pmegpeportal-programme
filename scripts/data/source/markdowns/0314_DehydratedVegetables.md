PROJECT REPORT ON DEHYDTRATED VEGETABLES Dehydrated vegetables INTRODUCTION Vegetables are available during specific seasons and they are perishable. Hence, majority of them are not available during off-season. To overcome this problem, dehydration technique has been developed by which vegetables in dehydrated form are preserved for a longer period and are made available during off-season. With this technology, certain high value and popular vegetables can be profitably sold. 1

PRODUCTS 1. Applications Dehydration technology is well established and proven. Certain products like green peas, cauliflower, carrots, spinach etc. command good prices during lean and off-season. Onion and garlic powder also has good demand round the year but these products are generally available throughout the year and powder is somehow not favored by the Indians. Hence, this note does not include onion and garlic powder. 2. Availability of know-how, Quality Standards and Compliance CFTRI, Mysore, has successfully developed the technical know-how. BIS has specified quality standards for different vegetables and depending upon the exact product mix, the promoters may like to adhere to them. Compliance with PFA Act is mandatory. 3. Legal issues regarding industry As per guideline of Food safety and standard Authority of India , the unit is required to register and obtain the License under the provisions of CENTRAL LICENSING [Food Safety & Standards ( Licensing & Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations 2011; Schedule I, Regulation 2.1.2(3)] 4. Proposed Location Unit may be located in suburban area of the city or nearer to Krishi Utpadan Mandi to have easy access to the sellers of Raw material at economic rates. 2

MARKET POTENTIAL 1 Demand and Supply Food habits of Indians are such that most of the households prepare vegetables every day. Due to climatic conditions and types of soil, many vegetables are cultivated throughout the year. The major limitation of bulk of the green vegetables is they are grown only during predetermined season which lasts for 3-4 months and thus their availability during rest of the months is a major problem. Hence, if they are made available during this period, then they command premium. Green house method enables cultivation of any vegetable during any season but calls for huge investment which affects the economic viability. Dehydration technique is, therefore, preferred. 2. Marketing Strategy With growing incomes, changing lifestyles and hectic daily schedule, market for dehydrated vegetables is growing especially in urban areas. Proper placement of products in the departmental stores, super markets, shopping malls etc. backed-up by publicity is the key to success. It is also possible to have tie-up with exclusive restaurants, star hotels, renowned caterers etc. for regular supplies MANUFACTURING PROCESS This note primarily considers dehydration of cabbage, cauliflower, spinach and carrots. Other suitable vegetables can also be thought of. In case of cauliflowers; they are chopped to make small pieces and washed. Then they are blanched and dried in cold air. Spinach leaves are separated from the stalk, washed and dried in the drier. As regards carrots, they are washed, scrapped and cubed after washing. Cubes are then blanched and dried. These dehydrated vegetables are then packed and stored carefully. Packing is very critical as any fungal growth would damage the product. Process and weight loss varies from vegetable to vegetable but on an average it is 25% as the vegetables are dehydrated. In other words, the input-output ratio is 4:1. 3

CAPITAL INPUTS 1. Land and Building The plot of about 500 sq.mtrs. is required as the built-up area requirement will be 220 sq.mtrs. Storage of vegetables would require area of 35 sq.mtrs, whereas packing room and finished goods' godown will occupy about 60 sq.mtrs. Vegetable washing tanks could be constructed adjacent to the raw material godown with asbestos sheets. Main production hall will be of around 100 sq.mtrs. and balance 25 sq.mtrs. could be allotted for office and laboratory. The entire area has to be neat and clean and completely hygienic. The building has to be of superior quality to maintain hygienic standards. Initially it is recommended to start the activity in rented premises instead of owned premises to avoid huge investment. 2. Plant and Machinery Easy and regular availability of fresh vegetables during each season and nearby urban markets are the critical aspects for arriving at the installed production capacity. For the purpose of this note and with a view to minimising initial capital investment, the rated capacity is taken at 150 tonnes with 1 shift working and 300 working days. For this following machines shall be required. Miscellaneous Assets Other assets like storage racks and bins, aluminium top working tables, exhaust fans, furniture and fixtures, electrical, plastic trays/jars/tubs, office equipments etc. shall be required Utilities Power requirement shall be HP whereas water required for washing of vegetables and for potable and sanitary purposes will be 2000 ltrs. per day. 4

Raw Material The all-important raw material will obviously be fresh vegetables. Hence, the location of the project has to be nearer to vegetable growing areas. Depending upon the availability of vegetables during different seasons, the product-mix may change. Likewise, the prices of raw materials would also change depending upon the exact product mix and crop pattern. Even at 100% capacity utilization, the monthly requirement of different vegetables, considering an average process and weight loss of 50% ,will be about 25 tonnes. This is not a very large quantity. Prices of vegetables vary and the product-mix may also change according to quantum of crop and consumer preferences. Hence, it is not feasible to arrive at variety-wise vegetables required every month and their individual prices. Therefore, average price of each vegetable is taken at Rs.15,000/- per ton. The all-important packing materials will be plastic bags made from suitable grade plastic, corrugated boxes, box strapping, labels etc 5

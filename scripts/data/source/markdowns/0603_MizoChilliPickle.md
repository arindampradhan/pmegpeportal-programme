MIZO CHILLI PICKLE MAKING UNIT Introduction: Due to its unique climatic, topographic, and cultivation characteristics, the state of Mizoram is endowed with a number of high-quality crop varieties that are unique to Mizoram. The Mizo Chilli, also known as Mizoram Bird's Eye Chilli, is of exceptional quality and is in high demand on both the national and international markets. Pickling is a process to preserve raw fruits & vegetables for longer time. The variety and potential for Mizoram Bird's Eye Chilli / Mizo chilli expansion is immense, but transportation, manufacturing, and marketing problems must be addressed. In Mizoram, the Mizo chilli is one of the most common and widely grown vegetables and spices. It is used to make spicy relative, pickles, chutneys, and hot sauces to be eaten with noodles, and it is in high demand in neighbouring states and countries such as China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, so the bulk of the produce is exported. Mizo Chilli cultivation can be found in the state of Mizoram. Mizoram has eight districts where three distinct varieties/quality levels of Mizo Chilli are grown. All of these types are assumed to be the same, with the exception of consistency variations. The bird eye red chili popularly known as Mizo chili is known for its pungent taste and smell used to make pickles which is widely consumed in India as well its neighbouring countries.

Uses & Market Potential: Mizoram is a major producer of Mizo Chilli, despite the fact that other types of chilli are almost non-existent. Other chilli varieties are smuggled into Mizoram from the neighbouring states of Manipur and Assam. Mizoram has immense capacity for large- scale development with proper market links, and every year, at least 20,000 tonnes are shipped to Bangladesh and neighbouring states by unlicensed traders. There has been a steady rise in the amount of product due to constant efforts for Agriculture and Horticulture production in Mizoram, with a particular emphasis of the government on Mizo chilli. In India several people are in the habit of devouring pickles for breakfast, lunch and dinner, as they need that kick of spices and flavour with each and every meal. Pickles, which are prepared by local people using local products, are mostly liked by the consumers. Homemade pickles are good in taste, but it takes prolonged time to prepare &require good sunlight also. The global pickles market reached a value of US$ 10.6 Billion in 2019. Many companies are preparing pickles by using organic raw materials & without adding any chemical preservatives. But the shelf life of organic pickles is less, which works as a hurdle to market growth. The global market demand for different pickles including mizo chilli pickle is growing extensively. Now days the distribution channel is highly improved and active. The market has been segmented into supermarkets & hypermarkets, convenience stores, independent retailers, online & others.

CHROME PLATING UNIT Introduction: The chrome plating technique is an electroplating method for depositing a thin coating of chromium onto a substrate (metal or alloy). Electroplating is accomplished by transferring an electric current between two electrodes that are submerged in a chromic acid-based electrolyte solution. The substrate to be coated will be one of the electrodes. Chromium atoms are deposited in a layer on the electrode to be plated during the flow of current between the two electrodes. Electroplating a thin coating of chromium onto a metal item is known as chrome plating (or chromium plating). Chrome is the end result of chrome plating. The chromed coating might be ornamental, offer corrosion protection, make cleaning easier, or improve the hardness of the surface. For cosmetic reasons, a less costly chrome imitator is sometimes employed. Depending on the type of substrate being plated, there are several variants to this procedure. Different etching solutions, such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and sulfuric acids, are required for different substrates. The etching of nimonic alloys with ferric chloride is very popular. When the component is electrically live, it may enter the chrome plating vat.

Uses & Market Potential: Chrome plating is used to provide increased corrosion resistance, surface hardness, to ease the maintenance process of the metal or for purely decorative purposes. Chrome plating provides protection in environments that are conducive to corrosion in other base materials. Chrome Plating on Market size was valued at USD 581.04 Million in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 1058.06 Million by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 7.8% from 2021 to 2028. From 2020 to 2025, the electroplating market is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2 percent, reaching $18.6 billion. An electrical current is used to deposit material on a workpiece in the electroplating process. It's a process that involves depositing a thin coating of metal on a substrate, which is a workpiece. Electroplating's main purpose is to change the physical characteristics of an item. The physical characteristics of the object are altered to improve its aesthetic appeal, wear resistance, thickness, and corrosion resistance. The increasing demand for metal consumer items is responsible for the market's expansion. Other factors that contribute substantially to market expansion include the rising usage of electroplating across several vertical industries, such as the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as military. Chromium is anticipated to increase at the fastest rate of 5.98 percent throughout the forecast period. Product: Chrome Plating of Metal Kitchen Basket Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Metal Cleaners  Chromium Trioxide  Nickel Sulphate

 Acids  Plating Chemicals  Lead Anodes  Plating Catalysts  Bus Bars  De-Mineralized Water Manufacturing Process: The steps are:  In the first stage to make chrome plating, raw materials are procured from the authorized vendors.  Secondly, the metal which is supposed to get chrome plated are cleaned by metal cleaners which helps removing surface dirt, oil etc. from the metal. Next it is rinsed under the running water. Once the workpiece or object has been thoroughly cleaned so that there’s no lingering debris, the product is ready for etching.  Etching of the product component is done after rinsing the metal for which they are dipped in the tank of sulphuric acid.  The dipped component is rinsed 2-3 times in water after which the metal gets ready for plating.  Now on this surface nickel plating is done by dipping the metal in a nickel tank for 10-15 mins after which it is rinsed in water.  The final stage is the chromium plating of the metal component and again after plating it is washed in water.  The final product is now ready for packaging and scale.

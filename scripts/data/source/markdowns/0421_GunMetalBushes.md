GUN METAL BUSHES INTRODUCTION: Bush is a plain bearing surface made of a comparatively softer metal that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary part in variety of applications. Since most rotating parts like shafts are made of steel, bushes or plain bearing is made of alloys viz brass and bronze which have excellent wear properties. Gunmetal is an alloy that is known for its robustness, heat resistance and anti-corrosive property. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Gunmetal is an alloy of copper, tin and zinc also known as bronze, which casts and machines well and is resistant to corrosion from steam and salt water and therefore it, is used to make steam and hydraulic castings, valves, gears, statues, and various small objects. There are several types of bush bearings viz brass, bronze, self-lubricated oil, graphite etc. lubricant impregnated bearings and bi-metal and Babbitt bearings. Bronze, Gun metal bushing, Phosphor Bronze, Aluminum Bronze, etc. are widely used in Submersible Thrust Bush and Earth Moving Bushing are manufactured using quality metal and alloys such as brass, bronze and gunmetal. To ensure quality, special compositions are chosen for bush bearings that can be either procured from local foundries or the unit can have its own foundry.

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK/TREND Bushes for bearings in machinery of wide range are essential and supply chain has been essentially domain of small medium sector units. At present, there are more than 100 manufacturers specializing in gun metal, brass, bronze etc. metal bushes. The brass bronze and other metal product clusters are mainly located in UP, Punjab, Haryana, Pune, Bombay, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Rajkot, Rajkot and Surendranagar. The gunmetal, brass and bronze bushes and other component castings market of world is valued at Rs 630 Billion in 2016 and is projected to reach Rs 700 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 2.8% between 2017 and 2022. Gun metal is a special compositions of Bronze Market, used by Industrial machinery and equipments, Marine engines and equipments, Infrastructure & Construction machinery, Automotive and stationary engines, Electrical & Electronics equipments, Aerospace & Defense, etc. Trend of new technology products to replace the brass and bronze has emerged viz graphite and PTFE lined bearings but the ease of production and compatibility of brass and bronze is not replaceable except in special applications. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES. IF ANY: Bushes are extensively used for all types of machines and appliances that have rotating shafts. Starting from automobiles, tractors, earth-movers, trailers, compressors and submersible pumps to even the home appliances and industrial machines of all types need bushes. Various designs are popular viz grooved, flanged bush housing etc. sizes and shapes. Bronze bearings & bushings, bronze casting & bushing, industrial bushing, brass bush, aluminum bronze bush, bearing bushing, submersible bronze bushes, submersible thrust bushes, earth moving bushings, etc. are wearable parts requiring frequent replacement requirements; therefore there is huge demand potential for these products. The entrepreneur can start with trade channels and tap OEM consumers for supply of select the product range. The entrepreneur can specialize and focus on specific product range / end user segment that have good market demand in the region in which it is located.

RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: Main raw materials are scrap or ingots of copper, brass, tin, zinc, etc. The unit is recommended with a pit furnace to cast its own castings. Other materials are in rods and bars of the readily available brass and bronze of desired compositions. The machine shop scrap will be used in furnace to produce own castings. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Bushes are produced by machining from the rods and castings. The process involves cutting from rods to desired size and then machining on lathe. Grooves and other machining can also be done on lathe and milling machine. For self-lubricating bush production bushes may be coated with FEP, PFA, PTFE (Teflon) and other metals like tin that provide better wear properties. The coating process can be done by simple ingenious spray attachments and torch processes on lathe. These coatings are sintered in small oven to get desired uniformity. MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS The Unit will have capacity of 60 MT of Gun metal bushes and other casting/ machined products per year of assorted types/ designs. The sales prices Gun metal bushes and other products of various types range are assumed at 400/- per Kg or more depending on type, shape complexity, metal composition, and volumes. The raw material cost brass bronze scrap is assumed at Rs315/-per Kg depending on grades. The material requirements are considered with wastage/ scrap/burnouts etc. of 4 % of finished products as most of generated scrap is reused. The unusable scrap is sold at @ Rs 80 to 150 per Kg. and the income of same is added. Energy Costs are considered at Rs 7 per Kwh and fuel cost is considered at Rs. 65 per liter. The depreciation of plant is taken at 15 % and Interest costs are taken at 11.50 % depending on type of industry.

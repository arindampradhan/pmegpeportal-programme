1. INTRODUCTION A particulate air filter is a device composed of fibrous materials which removes solid particulates such as dust, mold, and bacteria from the air. A chemical air filter consists of an absorbant or catalyst for the removal of airborne molecular contaminants such as volatile organic compounds or ozone. Air filters are used in applications where air quality is important, in building ventilation systems and in engines. All Modern cars are fitted with an Air cleaner on Carburetor intake. It’s Most Important function to prevent dust and other particles from getting in to the Carburetor and Engine Cylinder. Liquid and Air gas needs to be cleaned from particulate contaminants in most industrial applications using filters. Filter paper, non-woven fabrics, wire mesh, PU/PE foam etc. filter media are used to filter fluids. Normally, a semi-permeable paper barrier is used as filter and it is placed perpendicular to a liquid or air flow. Air filters are used in every internal combustion engine to remove particulates as these filters are very vital to improve operational efficiency of engines and prevent damage and wear to vital parts. Air filters are nothing but filters that clean up the air that goes inside our bike to help burn the fuel. Remember one thing here, the cleaner and purer the air, the better will be the combustion and hence the better efficiency and power delivery. Else to deliver the same amount of power you will end up burning more amount of fuel because the air quality was

not up to the mark. The very reason that was a major cause of incomplete combustion in the older vehicles resulting in a lot of smoke coming out of the exhaust. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Air filter is a device composed of fibrous materials which removes solid particulates such as dust, midland bacteria from the air so that only cleaned air reaches the automotive. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT Main materials are CRCA sheets for canisters and perforated barrels. Cast aluminium/ zinc / molded plastic parts used for top and bottom holding rim, and enclosures. Filter media chosen are filter paper/ non-woven fabric, wire mesh and PU foams. The filter assembly needs rivets/ fasteners all the materials are available in the country. Filter paper/ non-woven fabrics come in various porosity and grades depending on the applications the important parameters are wet strength, porosity, particle retention, volumetric flow rate, compatibility, efficiency and capacity. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The main activity of the unit is fabrication as per the design and fitments of filter element and producing major components. The steps normally involve: Sheet metal embossing and cutting of canister and top /bottom caps, machining of cast bottoms/tops caps of or get finished sheet metal/ plastic filter canisters and rims. Perforation and cutting of steel sheet on power press and rolling in to barrels to hold filter media. Drilling of fitment holes on bottoms/top. Pleating/ corrugation/ winding of Filter paper/ cloth /foam and assembly/ riveting to get the desired filter element. Assembly of complete filter element with top and bottom caps with/ without canister units.

Inspection and packing of filter elements for specified parameters followed by testing samples for specified parameters viz. flow rate, pressure drop, filtration efficiency and life cycle. Final Products are packed and dispatched. FLOW CHART Die casting of bottoms/tops by filling of dies by molten material. The material is melted in tilting furnace/pit furnace. Processing of sheet on 5 ton power press. Drilling of fitment holes on die casted bottoms/top. Assembling by riveting and covering with filter cloth.

# 0014 Project Profile On Assembling Of Electronic Gas Lighters

## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON ASSEMBLING OF ELECTRONIC GAS LIGHTERS Introduction : The Electronic Gas Lighter uses a piezo-electric crystal. This crystal has a property to generate voltage when it is mechanically deformed. It generates high voltages across a spark gap which when in proximity to a gas would ignite it . Gas lighters are being used by cooking gas users. It is durable due to its performance and economical as compared to the mechanical and electrical lighters. It does not require battery for its operation . It is safer, economical, reliable and quick in action. It requires virtually no maintenance. 1 Name of the Product : ELECTRONIC GAS LIGHTERS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft rented 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 69,000.00 Fly Press (No.3), Bench Drilling Machine (1/2'), Bench Grinder, Shearing Machine(10" x 10" SWG) , Injection Moulding Machine 15 Gm.

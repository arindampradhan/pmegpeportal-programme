1. INTRODUCTION Every year, trillions of cigarette butts end up in the environment, where they leech nicotine and heavy metals before decomposing into microplastic pollution. Every year, around 6.5 trillio n cigarettes are purchased by smokers all over the world. Every day, that's 18 billion. When a cigarette is smoked, the majority of the guts and paper wrapping dissolve, but not everything is burned. There are billions of cigarette filters—also known as butts or ends—left over, with just about a third of them ending up in the trash. The rest are thrown into the street or out a window carelessly. Because cigarette butts, which are typically thrown on the ground or into common trash, may include cigarette pollutants and chemicals created during combustion, they have been identified as harmful residues. As a result, pollutants in cigarette butts can be washed into surface water by rain, polluting the ecosystem. All leftovers must be disposed of in an environmenta l ly acceptable manner in Brazil, according to the National Policy on Solid Waste. Despite the fact that cigarette butts are not specifically listed in the law, they may be regarded as hazardous waste due to their features. Alkaline pulping was used to develop a cellulose pulp production process from cigarette butts at the University of Brasilia. This method is given as an alternative to a more environmentally responsible final disposal of the residue. A dark liquor is produced throughout the procedure, which was discovered to contain lignin, carbonyls, metals, nicotine, and particular tobacco nitrosamines.

Every year, around 100 billion cigarette butts are discarded in India's landfills. The cigarette filter is constructed of cellulose acetate, a type of non-biodegradable plastic that takes over ten years to totally degrade. As a result, cigarette waste is not only harmful to one's health but also to the environment. When cigarette trash is collected, it is separated: the tobacco that is typically left behind, as well as the paper that covers the cigarette butt, are degraded and used to produce manure, while the filter is recycled through a treatment process. In this process one reuses and reprocesses hard-to-recycle waste, of Cigarette Waste Brigade program, which diverts cigarette butts—along with plastic and foil cigarette packaging—from landfills and uses them to make pallets for industrial shipping. One of the most prevalent methods of developing a regulated and effective plastic recycling process is pelletizing plastic. Recycling operations can be cumbersome and time - consuming. There are several steps of sorting that must be completed. It's a huge problem to turn waste plastic into a feedstock for fresh manufacture. Plastic must be of a homogeneo us composition and size to be used as a feedstock in most manufacturing processes. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES These pellets are created from a variety of coloured Polypropylene materials and have a medium density. These, like mixed HDPE pellets, have a wide range of uses, including decking, piping, buckets, plastic furniture, containers, and more. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The paper wrapping of a cigarette burns and disintegrates after use, but the filters, sometimes known as stubs or butts, are discarded on the streets. Only about a third makes it to the trash can, according to reports. Upcycle everything that's left over after a cigarette is smoked to make goods ranging from pillows to soft toys. The group also employs a lot of people as a result of its long- term initiatives. This process can be broken down into the following steps:  Raw Material collection- At first collect cigarette waste from the streets, offices and other places collected in Vbins and in turn ensure the vendors a rate of Rs 250 for a kilo of cigarette butts.

 Segregation- The waste, mainly ash, tobacco, paper and the filter, is then separated manually. The paper and tobacco are converted into manure and the filters are treated and then made into cushions, toys and mosquito repellents. The procured cigarette butts are separated into three categories i.e. cellulose acetate, paper covering and leftover tobacco manually with necessary precautionary measures like gloves, masks and thread cutters in place for the workers.  Shredding- The cellulose acetate is shredded by an industrial shredder.  Treating- The shredded cellulose is then treated using a biodegradable chemical composition for 24- 36 hours.  Drying- The cleaned cellulose is then dried for further process.  Extrusion- The filter, which is made of a white synthetic fiber called cellulose acetate, is thoroughly cleaned, melted, and pelletized using a method called extrusion.  Packaging- The cellulose acetate pellets are then combined with other plastics, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, and used for new plastic products such as ashtrays, shipping pallets, or plastic lumber. Hence, the pellets are packed and supplied for further usage. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.25,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.800 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finis hed goods. Total inventory area is approx. 400 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 200 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. 

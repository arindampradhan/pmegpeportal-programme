PPRROOJJEECCTT RREEPPOORRTT ON GINGER PROCESSING INTRODUCTION The Ginger or Adrak is the dried underground stem or rhizome of the Zingiberous herbaceous plant. Ginger is obtained from the rhizomes of Zingiberofficinale. Ginger is harvested by digging out the rhizomes when the tops have died down. Ginger is a seasonal product but it is used extensively in many food preparations. Therefore, it is essential to convert a part of produce into low volume high value ginger to make the crop remunerative. As it is abundantly available in the region, different products like dehydrated ginger, ginger oil, ginger oleoresin may be developed. Ginger oil is primarily used as a flavoring agent in confectionary as well as in soft drinks. The ginger is also used for several medicinal purposes. Considering the potential market opportunity of such units, the present detail project report has been developed. The main objective of such initiative is to productively utilize the abundantly available resources of the local area and to enable uninterrupted supply of the products to market throughout the year.

A detailed analysis has been carried out considering mainly the aspects mentioned PROJECT DESCRIPTION The proposed project is that of setting up of a Ginger Processing unit at suitable location. The key products of the proposed project are as follows;  Dehydrated Ginger  Ginger Oil Ginger is a seasonal product but it is used extensively in many food preparations. Hence, dried ginger or ginger oil is used in large quantity during off-season. Ginger oil is distilled from the dried spice. The proposed project would procure the raw materials from the farm level available locally. After processing, the products would be supplied to the market through distributors/ wholesalers/retailers. MARKET PROSPECT Among the various vegetable crops, ginger offers tremendous scope for commercialization in north eastern region. Fresh and dried ginger, ginger oil and ginger powder are used in large quantities in many vegetarian and non-vegetarian food preparations in Indian, Continental and Chinese cuisine. Ginger also has medicinal attributes and is used in many households as well as by pharmaceutical companies. The exports of these products have also increased manifold in recent times. In view of the increasing application of these products in the various food and allied industries in the country and abroad, these is a good scope for the development of ginger-based industry to meet the future requirements of this industry in the region. Market Promotion plays a vital role for the generation of the potential customers therefore, application of marketing strategies is recommended. Marketing plan of the proposed project may include good quality maintenance, promotional campaign like offering special discounts, referrals, advertisement and tying up with buying houses.

TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS The process flow diagram is as follows: SELECTION OF FRESH GINGER RHIZOMES WASHING TO REMOVE THE ADHERING IMPURITIES PEELING/TREATING IN LIME WATER SOLUTION SLICING DRYING PULVERISING OF DRIED GINGER STEAM DISTILLATION FOR EXTRACTION OF OIL FILTERING AND PACKING Dehydrated Ginger: Ginger is washed and cleaned in water and then skin of ginger is peeled partially with the help of peeling machine. It is then dried in electrically operated tray drier at a temperature o of about 60 C. Even if ginger is to be used for extraction purposes, this temperature is o advisable as oil contents in ginger are not affected till 80 degrees Celsius. Drying time is 24 hours in crossflow type drier and 14 hours in through- flow drier. Dried ginger slices are packed in polythene bags and sealed. Average yield after drying is around 25%. Ginger Oil: Dry ginger are pulverized by the grinder to the required mesh size. Steam distillation is the preferred method for all essential oils produced in large quantities. The steam, produced in a boiler is introduced into an evaporation vessel which contains the ginger powder & water. The ginger powder is located on a grid placed at a certain distance above the level of the water which fills the bottom of the vessel.

The water is vaporized indirectly, by steam flowing in a pipe coil submerged by the water. The water vapour plus the distilled oil coming from the evaporator vessel is recovered in a separate water-cooled condenser. This mixture flowing out of the condenser is separated by decantation in a Florentine flask. The essential oil is collected at the top and distilled water leaves the flask at the bottom of the flask. As water still contains some soluble parts of the oil, it is sent back to the evaporator vessel to recover the soluble components by means of second distillation. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS The bureau of Indian Standards has formulated the following specifications for dehydrated ginger. Ginger whole & ground- IS: 1908-1980 (First Revision). The quality should conform to standards land down in PFA Act. However, for better marketing of this product standards may be maintained as per "AGMARK" and BIS specifications. FSSAI LICENSE: FSSAI License is issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of Family Health & Welfare, Government of India. Application to commence a food business must be made to the FSSAI in the prescribed format. Based on the application and supporting documents, FSSAI will accord approval. The Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations 2011introduced to improve the hygiene and quality of food has brought about tremendous changes in the food industry. As per the Act, no person shall commence or carry on any food business except under a FSSAI license or FSSAI registration. Therefore, any food manufacturing or processing or packaging or distributing entity is now required to obtain a FSSAI License or Registration. POLLTUION CONTROL: There is no major pollution problem associated with this industry except for disposal of waste which should be managed appropriately. However, waste water resulting from washing of ginger & lime treated ginger water may be safely dispersed over a large area of land for irrigation purpose. The promoter is advised to take "No Objection Certificate" from the State Pollution Control Board.

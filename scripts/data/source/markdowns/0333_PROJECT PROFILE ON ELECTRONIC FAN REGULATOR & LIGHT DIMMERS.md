# 0333 Project Profile On Electronic Fan Regulator & Light Dimmers

## Page 1

KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON ELECTRONIC FAN REGULATOR & LIGHT DIMMERS Introduction : Electronic Fan regulator is n eletronic device consisting of diacs, triacs, potentiometric resistances to provide step less control of fan speed. This is an energy saving device and has advantage over the conventional type of fan regulators having more energy losses. These regulators can also be used as a speed regulator for many other smll F. H. P. motors used in mixer, light dimmers etc. with appropriate current readings. 1 Name of the Product : ELECTRONIC FAN REGULATOR & LIGHT DIMMERS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work sheds qin.m stqr.sft RENTED 0 Rs.

4. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES. IF ANY The market for computer is expanding day by day to due to rapid computerization of offices for accounts, inventory, sales, correspondence and communications in all walks of life. The demand for computer continues to grow. Even though there are big competition in computer assembling the servicing of computers and providing quality networking services are in very poor shape even in metros. The small manufacturers have to compensate this tough competition with their better-quality services. Government as well as private offices need dedicated team of expert to service as well network their whole functioning on service contract basis in most reliable fashion. This project serves this grey area of activity. As of 2010 there were over 550,000 people employed in the maintenance and repair sector in the United States, and employment was expected to grow through 2018. More than 70% of those people work in small businesses of less than 5 people; another 20% work for companies with less than 20 people. While previously the industry had been primarily focused on fixing and upgrading business computers, most of the companies now do more than just maintenance and repair. Over the course of the 1990s, repair services were able to cope with more reliable and cheaper computers hurting business by replacing components instead of repairing them, using new diagnostic tools, and offering other services such as disaster recovery and virus protection. 5. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT Sr. No Description of the item Quantity Cost/Unit Total Amount 1 Processor, motherboard, 2 sets – for assembling 35,000 INR 70,000 INR monitor, keyboard, Hard Disk, 2 computers DVD writer, SMPS, RAM, Speakers and UPS. 2 Accessories for networking and 1 set of equipment 15,000 INR 15,000 INR other spare hardware frequently used. 6.

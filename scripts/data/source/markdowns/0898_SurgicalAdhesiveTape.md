SURGICAL ADHESIVE TAPE INTRODUCTION Tape refers to a wide class of products with extremely small thickness, considerable width, long length usually rolled over a hub and are utilized to hold some component or part by wrapping tape around that component. A sub class of tape called adhesive tapes has a layer of adhesive on one or both of its sides based on its further classification, these tapes are composed of base tape of a material like paper, fabric or plastic which is responsible for overall strength of adhesive tape with glue on its surface for adhesion. The surgical tape is a class of adhesive tape that are used to hold various other components of dressing over a wound in its required place by utilizing its adhesive which gently adheres to skin as well as dressing components. These Tapes use a hypoallergenic adhesive along with a breathable porous material like cotton, 3M Micropore paper etc. These base tape materials allow restricted passage of air and moisture to prevent irritation and rashes.

RAW MATERIAL 1) Base Tape Roll (Cotton based material tape or 3M Micropore Paper) 2) Zinc Oxide based Adhesive MACHINE REQUIRED The surgical tape manufacturing is usually carried out on a single machine composed of several sub-processing and tensioning station, as it will reduce the cost of roll winding station; roll unwinding station; feed, alignment and tensioning rollers, which will be required in each individual machine for each respective station and it will also reduce the quality of product due to manual handling. The surgical tape manufacturing requires roll unwinding, tensioning, coating, drying, roll winding, tape slitting and packaging processes, which are performed in individual sections of Adhesive Tape Making Machine.

The machine has a roll unwinding station, tape alignment and tensioning station, coating station, drying station, roll winding station and tape slitting station; these stations are in general required for any adhesive tape manufacturing. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK / TREND The segment of absorbent and packing gauze surgical dressings is expected to grow worldwide owing to factors such as increasing incidences of road accidents and sports related injuries. Globally raising aging population and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases. In addition, the swift healing times brought about by the usage of wound dressings make them useful during emergency care. The rising incidence of wound infections raises the sale of wound dressings, thus having a positive impact on the market.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS The roll of base tape material is feed to tape roll unwinding section of adhesive tape making machine which simply unrolls the tape from its roll and feeds it to alignment and tensioning roller section via a set of feed rollers. In alignment and tensioning section machine ensures that the base tape material is aligned properly so as to avert improper coating of adhesive on tape, thus the tape is feed to coating section which applies coating of Zinc Oxide based adhesive onto the base tape uniformly along its width. The tape is then passed through a drying section, which may use an air drier or air heater, so as to properly dry the applied adhesive, followed by which tape is feed to tape roll winding section of machine which simply rolls the tape back to form a large roll. This roll is then feed to tape slitting section of machine which utilizes an appropriate cutter to simply cut the giant roll into number of tapes. These tapes are taken out of machine packaged and sent for sale. Note: An extra section is present in some machines in which a smooth non-stick paper is applied to adhesive side of tape prior to tape roll winding section, so as to prevent stickiness due to adhesive on adhesive free side of tape. DEMAND PROJECTION The demand for surgical adhesive tape is mainly influenced by population growth, economic growth and expansion of the health sector. The health sector has been given due attention by the government. Due to the favorable environment created for private investment a number of health facilities including hospitals and clinics are being established throughout the country. Medical and health facilities registered an annual average growth of 12.00% approx. over the past four years.

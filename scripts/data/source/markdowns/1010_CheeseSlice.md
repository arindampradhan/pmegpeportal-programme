1. INTRODUCTION Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. Cheese is a milk-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavours, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Cheese styles, textures and flavours depend on the origin of the milk. Cheese is produces by milk which is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria which turn milk sugars into lactic acid and the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available. Processed cheese is a food product made from cheese and unfermented dairy ingredients mixed with emulsifiers. Additional ingredients, such as vegetable oils, salt, food colouring, or sugar may be included. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  Cheese slices are used as a topping on pizza, filling in appetizers, slices on hamburgers, and sauces in pasta dishes.  Cheese slice is an excellent source of getting our daily calcium intake without supplements.  Cheese consumption are used for weight gain purpose in a healthy manner.  Cheese is an excellent source of protein help to improve strong immune system, healthy hair, and proper fluid balance in our body.

 Cheese can reverse hypertension by lowering blood pressure. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- Raw material procurement Production Process Raw Material Procurement Procurement is the connection process of purchasing and arranging in bound movement of all items, supplies, materials, parts, finished inventory and general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses. Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Cheese slices production unit  Preparing the milk: Before it can be turned into cheese, the milk may need to be processed.  Acidifying the milk: Adding cultures to the milk allows it to begin to ferment and makes it more acidic.  Curdling the milk: Adding rennet causes a reaction that curdles the milk, creating curds.  Cutting the curd: The cheese maker cuts the curd with knives and heats till further separating the curds and whey.  Processing the curd: Processing the curd through stirring, cooking and washing continue to acidify and dry the curds.  Draining the whey: The whey is drained leaving only a mat of cheese curds.  Cheddaring the cheese: The cheese maker next cuts the curd mat into sections and repeatedly flips the sections before milling the mat.  Salting the cheese: Some cheeses require is dry salting, and other require brining.  Shaping the cheese: Cheese get the shape (slices) using molds to assist into final shape.  Aging the cheese: Some cheeses are aged for anywhere from a number of days to a number of years.

3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 600 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.10,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.200 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 200 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 100 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Cheese Agitator: The cheese agitator is used to proper mixing of the ingredient in the milk so that proper formation take place.

 Cheese Vat: Cheese vat is a round vat where the curd is moulded and cut in the cheese making process. Cheese vats have been designed to maximise yield and usability.  Curd Strainer: The curd strainer is used to separate curd from whey before going to the pressing process.  Cheese Press Machine: The press machine is used to remove all the moisture present in before going to slicing process.

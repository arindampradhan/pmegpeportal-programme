Market: Agarbatti Industry is one of the labour intensive cottage types of traditional industries in Moreover; it is an export‐oriented industry also. In fact, this is one the items considered for boosting exports. Owing to the low level of technology involved in this industry, this can be taken to rural /urban areas without much difficulty. The entire production of the unit is pr esently supplied to resellers at Lucknow. However the firm is planning to establish own brand and start direct marketing to earn more profits. Capacity: The proposed unit shall work for single shift of 10 hours per day for 300 working days per annum. Though some of the operations are to be mechanized the overall productivity will depend on product mix and skills of operators. The machine processes Kg of raw material in 10hrs 60 Process: All the ingredients in powder form are mixed well in the proper proportion with water to a semi solid paste. This paste is applied to bamboo sticks and rolled on wooden‐planks with hands uniformly. The raw sticks are then dried and packed in suitable bundles. For manufacture of perfumed agarbattis the concentrated perfume is diluted first with white oil or diethyl phthalate (Generally 1:3) and raw agarbattis are dipped suitably in dipping trays. The perfumed batties are packed immediately in butter paper bags or polypropylene bags and finally in cartons.

PROJECT REPORT ON SOLDERING WIRE INTRODUCTION:- Soldering wire is used in Electrical, Electronics and telephone industries for soldering ratio, transistor, TV. Circuit and computer circuits too as well as electrical connection. The industry can be taken up small scale basis with good profitability. MARKET POTENTIAL:- The product is having very good demand in indigenous market as well as in foreign countries. There is a great Export potential for this item in Middle East countries. Its price varies depending upon the ratio of tin, lead and other alloy. BASIS & PRESUMPTION:- 1. The project file has been prepared on the basis of single shift of 8-hrs. a day and 25- working days in a month at 60% efficiency. 2. It is presumed that Ist year, the capacity utilization will be 60% followed by 70% in the next year and 100% in the fifth year. 3. The rates quoted in respect of salaries and wages for skilled worker and others are on the basis of minimum rates in the state 4. Interest rate for the fixed and working capital has been @ 11.50% on an average 2

5. whether financed by the bankers or financial institutional. 6. The rate quoted in of machinery, equipments and raw material are those prevailing at the time of preparation of the project profile and are likely to vary from place to place and suppliers to suppliers. When a tailor made project profile is prepared, necessary changes are to be made. 7. The payback period may be 5-years after the initial gestation period. 8. The gestation period in implementation of the project may to be the tune of 6to 9 months which includes making all arrangements, completion of all formalities, market surveys and tie-ups etc. once all the arrangements are made and quality/standards achieved the 100% project capacity may be achieved at the end of three years. However, a detailed PERT/CPM/chart with implantation period has been given in the report. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULES:- The implementation of the project includes various jobs/exercise such as procurement of technical know how, transfer of technology, market surveys and tie- ups, preparation of project report, selection of site, registration, financing of project, procurement of machinery and raw material etc. recruitment of staff, erection/commissioning of machines, trial production and commercial productions etc. In order to efficiently and successfully implement the project in the shortest period , According to which a minimum period of 8 monhs is involved in family starting the project on commercial basis. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The process consists of following operations:- 1. Melting as per requirements. 2. Pouring in metal Moulds. 3. Filling the flax. 4. Bar Rolling. 5. Wire Rolling. 6. Coiling 7. Packaging. The recommended percentage of thin, lead, antimony is to be melted first and then poured in Metal Moulds keeping the provision of central hole longitudinally for subsequent pouring of rosin mixture and then it is allowed for cooling. The bars are rolled plant and further it is reduced to thinner gauges in wire rolling machine according to the requirement. Finally, the material is packed and kept ready for marketing. The solder Wires of different compositions of tin and lead mentioned below may be manufactured with the help of some machinery and equipments. However the sale price will vary and the rates will be lowered with presences of more percentage of lead. 3

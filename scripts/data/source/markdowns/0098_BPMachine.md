BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE UNIT Introduction: Doctors to measure the blood pressure of Patient in the clinic use B. P. machines. If the display of B. P. Machine is digital then it is called as Digital Blood Pressure Machines. Blood pressure is the pressure that the blood exerts against the walls of the arteries as it passes through them. The high and low points of this pressure waves are measured with the sphygmomanometer or blood pressure monitor and are expressed numerically in millimeter of mercury. Pulse refers to the periodic ejection of blood from the heart left ventricle into the arota.the left ventricle or chamber receives blood from the left atrium, another of the heart chambers. By contracting the left ventricle drives the blood into the aorta, a central artery through which blood is relayed into the arteries of all limbs and organs except lungs. Uses & Market Potential: Nowadays, Electronic Blood Pressure Machines are majorly used in households. Whether a person have been diagnosed with hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) or they want to keep track of their health, a blood pressure monitor is a must have at home for keeping your numbers under control. Home-based monitors are usually digital and the whole measurement process is almost automatic.

Electronic B. P. machines have a wide market prospect. This is sold in local/national market and also there are avenues for export market. The global blood pressure monitoring devices market size was valued at USD 1.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.2% from 2021 to 2028. Increasing incidences of hypertension due to changing lifestyles are contributing to the growth of the market over the forecast period. According to the estimates published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019, around billion people around the globe have hypertension, which is a major cause behind premature death worldwide. The demand for BP monitors is very high on account of the growing geriatric population and increasing risk of lifestyle associated disorders among a wide population due to the rising incidences of obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Product: Blood Pressure Machine Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Air Tube and Plug  Blood Pressure Cuff  Adapter  PCB with all components  LCD Display Unit  Battery  Packing Material

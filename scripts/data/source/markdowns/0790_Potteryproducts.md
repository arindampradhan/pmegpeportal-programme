POTTERY Introduction Pottery is the process of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard, durable form. Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural "potteries"). Pottery is made by forming a ceramic (often clay) body into objects of a desired shape and heating them to high temperatures (600- 1600 °C) in a bonfire, pit or kiln and induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing the strength and rigidity of the object. Much pottery is purely utilitarian, but much can also be regarded as ceramic art. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Clay-based pottery can be divided into three main groups: earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. These require increasingly more specific clay material, and increasingly higher firing temperatures. All three are made in glazed and unglazed varieties, for different purposes. All may also be decorated by various techniques. In many examples the group a piece belongs to is immediately visually apparent, but this is not always the case. Pottery originated before the Neolithic period. Pottery objects are made from damp clay mixed with other materials. They are then fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures. Firing makes the clay hard. The potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again. The fired glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny, decorative and water-tight.

Health Benefits of Pottery Products Pottery has been around for thousands of years and is a therapeutic art form that provides health benefits not only for the mind, but the body as well.  Reduce stress: All forms of art have physical and mental health benefits, and are helpful when it comes to reducing stress and other worries, just like playing real money pokies can be. Creating something unique offers satisfaction and making something from clay means bringing out our creative side. By exploring our creativity we can better connect with ourselves and the environment. Pottery is great for all ages and there is not right or wrong way of creating something from clay.  A mood Enhancer: Creating something is a way for many people to forget their sadness and grief, which ultimately results in improving your mood. We can forget about our stresses and problems even if just for a short time. We can also improve other features of our mental health such as confidence, self-expression and spontaneity.  Help with focusing: Instead of worrying about things in your life rather change your focus to creating something. While you are concentrating on making something you do not allow influences from outside to affect you, and you can focus solely on your art. By focusing on one thing you allow your mind to relax and in turn this will help you focus better in other spheres of your life.  Physical benefits: Not only are there mental benefits, but also physical benefits. Even though pottery is not a strenuous activity it is strengthening to the hands, wrists and arms and offers health benefits for those who suffer with arthritis in their hands.  A form of self-expression: Any type of art is a form of expressing oneself and pottery is no different. Pottery allows you to create things from a lump of clay and as you progress and learn more you will try out new techniques and stretch your imagination as you become more creative with your work. Not only is there creativity in the moulding of the clay, but also once the item has been fired.

Types of pottery products There are three main types of pottery/ceramic. These are earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. 1. Earthenware: Earthenware is clay fired at relatively low temperatures of between 1,000 to 1,150 degrees. This results in a hardened but brittle material which is slightly porous (small holes through which liquid or air can go through), therefore can not be used to contain water. 2. Stoneware: Stoneware is made from a particular clay which is fired at a higher temperature of 1,200°C. This results in a more durable material, with a denser, stone-like quality. The finished product will be waterproof and unlike earthenware, does not need to be glazed. 3. Porcelain: Porcelain comes from a refined clay which is fired at very high temperatures of approximately 1,200–1,450°C. The result is an extremely hard, shiny material often white and translucent in appearance. Pottery Products Market Analysis India along with several other developing countries of Asia is considered as one of the first Asian countries to manufacture as well as export products of pottery. The important markets for pottery products are USA, Mexico, Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Italy and France. However, the share of global market of India in pottery products is believed to be less than 1%. The important suppliers list includes China, UK, Japan and USA. The yearly production of pottery products in the Khurja units of Uttar Pradesh is slated to be around ` 85 crore. Out of this about 20% is exported in the international market. Among the pottery products that are exported from India, the most common ones are chemical porcelains, handicraft art ware and more.

In order to improve the overall condition of the India pottery industry, it is important to identify the various requirements of the manufacturing centers, technological development along with advancement of the centers with help structures have also become a necessity. Proper review of the industry, analyzing the need, gap and formulating of a proper plan are also important. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machinery are required for Pottery Products manufacturing process:  Potter Wheel (Chak Machine): A horizontal revolving disc on which wet clay is shaped into pots or other round ceramic objects.  Furnance (Bhatti): Used for millennia to turn objects made from clay into pottery. With the help of these machines, the work of shaping and drying the products completes. After that product can be sold in market. Manufacturing Process 1. Raw material i.e. Procurement of soil. 2. Filter the soil & add water into it accordingly. 3. After that mix it properly. 4. Keep that mixed material at the potter wheel. 5. After that different shapes is given to the clay. 6. Now, keep the prepared utensils and pottery products in open field for drying of product. 7. After that keep the products in the furnace. 8. Painting & brushing of product.

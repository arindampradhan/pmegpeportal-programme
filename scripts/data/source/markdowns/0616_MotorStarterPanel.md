MOTOR STARTER PANEL Introduction: A Starter is a device that controls the use of electrical power to equipment, usually a motor. As the name implies, starters "start" motors. They can also stop them, reverse them, and protect them. Starters are made from two building blocks, Contactors and Overload Protection. Motor soft starter, is a device that is installed and incorporated with many industrial or commercial systems that aims to limit torque and power load. A starter turns an electric motor or motor controlled electrical equipment on or off, while providing overload protection. Starters represent another evolution in motor control applications. The two main types of starters are Manual Starters and AC Magnetic Motor Starters, commonly known as Motor Starters. Working of motor starter Panel: Motor starters consist of two devices—a contactor that completes the circuit to the motor and an overload relay that monitors the current the motor is drawing. This overload protection device is set to a predetermined maximum load that the motor can safely handle. When a condition occurs that causes the motor to exceed the

maximum load, the device opens the motor starter control circuit and the motor is turned off. Motor Starter Panel Market analysis: With rapid industrialization in urban and semi urban areas as well as in agriculture heavy use of pumping sets the demand of Electric Motors starters is increasing very fast. India electric motors market is projected to surpass $ 2.08 billion by 2024. Anticipated growth in the market can be attributed to increasing number of industries and construction activities across the country, in addition to growing government focus towards adoption of energy efficient motors. Raw Material requirements: Following raw material is required as the major raw material for the Motor starter Panel assembling process. S No. Description Amount 1 Cabinet Rs 800 per unit 2 Contractor Rs 1000 per unit 3 Control Relay Rs 800 per unit 4 Terminal Rs 150 per unit 5 MCB Rs 650 per unit 6 Indicators Rs 50 per unit 7 Tools & dies Rs 100 per unit Average raw material cost per Motor starter panel is approx. Rs 3550 Machinery Requirements: Major machines and equipments are as follows: S No. Name Amount 1. Soldering Machine 250000 2. Pick & Place Machine 800000 3. Crimping Machine 200000

Testing equipments & Hand 100000 Tools Total Amount 1500000 Assembling process of motor starter Panel: Process Flow:  Making of Top & Bottom Cover  Assembly of bought out components  Wiring of Starter as per Circuit line diagram  Fitting of Beading and Rubber knockouts etc.  Pasting of Circuit line diagram & Name Plate  Quality Control Testing & Inspection  Packing & Dispatch of Product for Sales Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 5 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1

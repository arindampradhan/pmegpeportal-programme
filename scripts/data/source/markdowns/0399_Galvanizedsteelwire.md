GALVANIZED MS WIRE Introduction: Mild Steel Galvanised steel wire popularly known as galvanised wire have extensive application in various field. It has got excellent demand in pre- stressed concrete product like railway sleeper, telegraph and telephone, electric pole etc. and also find ample application in pre-casted cement product like pipes, frames of door and windows etc. On the other hand it has its own market in the field of strands and also its domestic demand can not be ignored. The M. S. Wire are drawn to required dia and then galvanised i.e. coating of zinc is employed on it, gives excellent anti corrosion property to steel wire. Market: As discussed above, these products have good demand in various fields. The more and more electrification and expansion of railway network associated with gauge conversion of railway track is expected to create huge market. On other hand the demand in the field of pre-casted cement product

and domestic is expected to increase in many folds. Same way expansion of telephone network will also add demand. It is also used in strand which has got market in electrical and railways etc. G. I. Wires is also used in shipping in the form of round strand. Looking into above it has good market potential. Raw material: Major raw material requirements are as follows: 1. MS Wire rod of 6mm to 8mm 2. Lead 3. Zinc 4. Furnace Oil 5. Other material like charcoal, oil, Asbestos, etc. Machinery Requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Price Amount Bull block type heavy duty wire drawing 1 400000 400000 Machine, 750 mm end drum with electric Motor and other accessories etc. Bull Block type heavy duty wire drawing 1 300000 300000 m/c. 600 mm end drum with electric motor and other accessories etc. Multi stage wire drawing m/c. with 4 dia 1 200000 200000 in row electric motor and other accessories etc. Pickling tank – 2m x 8m x 2m 1 100000 100000 Oil fired lead bath furnace 6 m x 1 m x½ m 1 620000 620000 with 7.5 H.

S. Wire rods of 6 mm to 8 mm in coil form purchased is first subject to pickling operation where rust and any other material sticked to it is removed and wire is fluxed. After pickling operation wire is drawn on bull black wire drawing machine to reduce the wire dia to desire specification. The number of passes will depend upon the feed dia and final dia required. Generally in one pass 20% reduction is achieved. The finer dia will be obtained on multistaged wire drawing machine. The drawn wire now will be sent for galvanizing. Here, at first instance wire will be passed through lead bath furnace, where annealing action will be done, followed by wire passing through quenching tank. Then same wire will pass through fluxing tank and finally from zinc furnace where coating of zinc will be done.

The speed of wire passing is adjusted to such a way that all operation are done according to need. These speeds will be adjusted by take up machine where galvanized wire will be spool. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 50 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

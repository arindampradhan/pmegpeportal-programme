HDPE EDIBLE OIL CONTAINER (15 Ltr.) Introduction: Today India is one of the biggest consumers of edible oil in the world. However, due to improper packaging, adulteration of edible oil is always a big worry for the oil manufacturers and consumers. The Government is also taking serious view about the major health hazard caused due to adulteration and is committed to ensure safe and sterile packaging of edible oil in the interest of the health of the average Indian. Currently more than 90% of edible oil is supplied in the market in unpacked form or reusable tin packs of 15 kgs. However, 15 kgs. plastic containers are better material compared to conventional packing as far as safe and economical packaging is concerned. Beside, 15 kgs, packaging conforms to the storage mentality of the average Indian household who generally stock their average yearly requirement of edible oil well in advance in 15 kgs tin containers. Plastic containers score over time packing in handling low weight, energy conservation and assurance of safe and tamper proof packing. Market Potential: Due to some quality maintenance and hygienic conditions requirement, the Government has imposed the partial ban on the

safe of unpacked edible oil in the market. By seeing this fact, it is assumed that there will be good demand for the plastic containers as these are economical as compared to conventional metal containers. The new concept of packing in HDPE containers is likely to pick up in the near future. As compared to metal container, it is easy to manufacture HDPE Containers. Raw material: Major raw material that is only used is HDPE Granules. Machinery Requirement: Major machines and equipments that are used are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Extrusion Blow Moulding Machine 15 1 3000000 3000000 ltr. Capacity with all accessories alongwith compressor and cooling tower Screen Printing Machine 1 100000 100000 Mould & Dies Ls 400000 400000 Scrap Grinder 1 250000 250000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 3800000 Manufacturing Process: These containers are being produced by extrusion blow moulding process. Raw Material HDPE is fed into the hopper and is melted in the cylinder by application of heat. This molten mass is conveyed by means of screw and stored in an accumulator. The accumulated plastic – mass (predetermined in weight) is forced through a die to form a tube called the parison. Taking the tube inside the mould and sealing one end, the parison is inflated by blowing air inside the mould through an air nozzle. The mould is cold by circulating of cold water through the cooling channels of the mould. The article is ejected automatically by machine. Deflashing

operation is done to remove top and bottom flash on the article. Caps are moulded on injection moulded machine which can be procured from outside. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

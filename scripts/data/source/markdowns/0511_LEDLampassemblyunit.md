PROJECT REPORT ON ‘ LED BULB ASSEMBLY UNIT ’ Production Capacity: 45000 Nos. per annum INTRODUCTION- LED is semiconductor Technology that emits light at the junction of oppositely charged materials when voltage forces electron movement. Led based lighting systems are devices consisting of many LEDs chips embedded on the LED fixtures base and fitted with rectifier circuit that provides regulated current output at the low voltage that makes them to be operated on AC Circuit because LEDs requires DC to operate. The whole PCB circuit board is fitted inside a plastic enclosure along with the metallic cap and Smokey reflector. MARKET POTENTIAL- Conventional lighting systems represent mainly incandescent light bulbs and compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). LED lighting system provides advantages over conventional lighting systems in terms of better energy efficiency, better energy costs, longer lifetime, less temp. Sensivity, higher light output. This leads them to be better Lighting substitute and good market prospect. Therefore the market prospect for LED based Lighting system is good and booming. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS (i) The basis for calculation of production capacity has been taken on single shift basis on 60% efficiency. (ii) The maximum capacity utilisation on single shift basis for 300 days a year. During first year and second year of operations the capacity utilisation is 60% and 70% respectively. The unit is expected to achieve full capacity utilisation from the third year onward. (iii) The salaries and wages, cost of raw materials, utilities, rent etc are based on the prevailing rates in and around Patna. These cost factors are likely to vary with time and location. (iv) Interest on term loan and working capital loan must be preferably current rate. Otherwise the rate of interest on an average may be taken as 11.50%. This rate may vary depending upon the policy of the financial institution/agencies from time to time. (v) The cost of machinery and equipment refer to a particular make/model and prices are approximate. (vi) The breakeven point percentage indicated is of full capacity utilisation. (vii) The project preparation cost etc whenever required could be considered under preoperative expenses.

(viii) The essential production machinery and test equipments required for the projects have been indicated. The unit may utilize common test facilitates available at ETDC and ERTLs and Regional Testing Centre (RTC). TECHNICAL ASPECT Process of Manufacturing; This project profile is made for the assembling of LED based Lighting system cum LED Lamp up to 10 W. The assembling of LED based Lighting system cum LED Lamp consists of the following steps: 1. Procurement/import of LED chips of Mili Watt rating, Procurement of Circuit and other mounting devices. 2. Embedding of LED Chips of miliwatt rating on the PCB board with the rectifier circuit, filter circuit etc. 3. Fitting of PCB Board with the holder cap and plastic modules fitted with the Smokey reflector to form a compact unit. 4. Testing of the assembled LED Lighting systems and packing QUALITY CONTROLS & STANDARDS As Per IS 16102 (Part I & II) 2012 PRODUCTION CAPACITY (PER ANNUM) Qty; 45000Nos. Value: Rs.74,25,000 MOTIVE POWER 5KW POLLUTION CONTROL The govt. Accords utmost importance to control environmental pollution. The Small- Scale entrepreneur should have an environmental friendly attitude and adopt pollution control measures by process modification and technology substitutions. India having acceded to the Montreal Protocol in sept.1992,the production and use of Ozone depleting substances (ODS) like Chlorofluore Carbon (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, halons and methyl Chloroform etc. Need to be phased out immediately with alternative chemicals/solvents. A notification for detailed rules to regulate ODS phase out under the Environment Protection Act 1986 have been put in place with effect from 19th July 2000. The following steps are suggested which may help to control pollution in electronics industry wherever applicable: i) In electronic industry fumes and gases are released during hand soldering/wave soldering/dip soldering, which are harmful to people as well as environmental and the end products. Alternative technologies may be used to phase-out the existing polluting technologies. Numerous new fluxes have been developed containing 2- 10% solids as apposed to the traditional 15-35 % solids.

ii) Electronic industry uses CFCs,carbon tetrachloride and Methyl chloroform for cleaning of printed Circiut boards after assembly to remove flux residues left after soldering and various kinds of foams for packaging. Many alternative solvents could replace CFC-113 and methyl chloroform in electronics cleaning. Other chlorinated convents such as trichloroethylene,per chloroethylene and methylene chloride have been used an effective cleaners in electronic industry for many years. Other organic solvents such as Ketenes and Alcolols are effective in removing both solder fluxes and many polar contaminants. ENERGY CONSERVATION With the growing energy needs and shortage coupled with rising energy cost, a greater thrust in energy efficiency in industrial sector has been given by Govt. of India since 1980s. The energy Conservation Act 2001 has been enacted on 18th August 2001which provides for efficient use of energy its conservation and capacity building of Bureau of Energy Efficiency created under the act. The following steps may be help for conservation of Electrical Energy: i) Adoption of energy conserving technology, production aids and testing facilities. ii) Efficient management of process/manufacturing machineries and systems, QC and testing equipments for yielding maximum energy conservation. iii) Optimum use of electrical energy for heating during soldering process can be obtained by using efficient temperature controlled soldering and desoldering stations. iv) Periodical maintenance of motors compressors etc v) Use of power factor correction capacitors, proper selection and layout of lighting systems timely switching on/off of the lights, use of Compact Fluorescent Lamps wherever possible.

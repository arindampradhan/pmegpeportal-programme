## Page 1

PCBI-09 POLYMER AND CHEMICAL BASED INDUSTRY KHADI & VILLAGE INDUSTRIES COMMISSION PROJECT PROFILE FOR GRAMODYOG ROJGAR YOJANA PRODUCTION OF OXALIC ACID Barks containing Oxalates obtained from forest Department or local panchayat are stored first. During the fusion process, caustic soda solution in first warmed at reactor up to 60 deg. Celceous. Pieces of Oxalate barks are disintegrated & sieved and placed in screw conveyor to reaction vessel with hot solution of soda. Steam is passed through the reactor vessel in order to maintain desired level of temperature. There is a good demand in domestic and international market. 1 Name of the product Oxalic Acid Crystals 2 Project Cost a) Capital Expenditure Rs. 3,00,000.00 Land & Building Shed 1000 sq.ft.

LIME PICKLE MAKING UNIT Introduction: The preservation of food in brine or in vinegar is known as pickling. It is one of the most ancient method of method of preserving fruits and vegetables. Pickles are god appetizers and add to the palatability to a meal. They stimulate the flow of gastric thus help in digestion. Fruit are generally preserved in sweetened and spiced vinegar, while vegetable is preserved in salted vinegar. Pickles can be preserved in one of two ways: lactic acid fermentation of vegetables with or without the addition of salt, or acetic acid preservation of vegetables (vinegar). The products made by these two methods are very different each one has its own distinctive taste and texture. Salt improves the taste and flavour and hardness of the tissue of the vegetable and controls fermentation. Salt content of 15 percent or above prevent microbial spoilage. This method of preservation is generally used only for vegetable which contains very little sugar and hence sufficient lactic acid cannot be formed by fermentation to act as preservative. However, some fruit lime mango etc. Several kinds of pickles are sold in the Indian market lime pickle is the one of the important pickles. These are commonly made in the homes as well as commercially level.

BODY LOTION Introduction: A Body lotion is a low-viscosity topical preparation intended for application to the skin. By contrast, creams and gels have higher viscosity, typically due to lower water content. Body Lotions are applied to external skin with bare hands, a brush, a clean cloth, or cotton wool. While a lotion may be used as a medicine delivery system, many lotions, especially hand lotions and body lotions are meant instead to simply smooth, moisturize, soften and perhaps perfume the skin. Types of body lotion: Different types of body lotion are available in the market, which are as follows:  Dry skin care body lotion  Soft skin care body lotion  General purpose body lotion.

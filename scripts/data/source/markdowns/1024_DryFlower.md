Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Dry Flower Manufacturing unit  Harvesting of Materials for Drying: Flowers and foliage should be collected from the field, one or two days after irrigation. The collected flowers should be free from surface moisture and dew. It is better to collect the material in the dry season on a sunny day.  Moisture Retention after Drying: Moisture retention in the flowers after drying influences flower shape & lower moisture content provides rigidity and results in uniform cell contraction in the flowers while the higher moisture content in dried flowers lead to flaccid flower.

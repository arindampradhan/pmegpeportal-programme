wet soil into beautiful shapes via art of hand and wheel. The pottery industry is often called “from mud to money” industry/sector. The black clay pottery of Nizamabad in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh, India is a unique type of clay pottery known for its dark shiny body with engraved silver patterns. It was registered for Geographical Indication tag in December 2015. Nizamabad had been famous for this art since Mughal rule (Aurangzeb). Fine textured clay is used which is locally available. The silver wire around some pieces is inspired by Bidriware (metal handicraft from Bidar). It’s a long process to be done cautiously. Now the black shiny pots and vessels are ready to attract and seduce your eyes. Variety of household and decorative items are made including vases, plates, pots, saucers, lamp, tea-pots, bowls, chillum (pipes), incense stick holder, surahi are the attractions. Also, they make a statue which reflects the divine beauty. People who visit here can’t deny buying these products. The focus is to revive it for day to day use, so that consumption increases and there is a growing demand. The pottery of Nizamabad has a unique place at the international market. 3. Market Potential: The craft originated from Kutch region of Gujarat state. Some potters of the region migrated to Nizamabad during the Mughal rule of Aurangzeb. The silver patterns are inspired from Bidriware of Hyderabad which decorates pots using silver wires. Around 200 families are involved in the craft in Nizamabad and majority of their works are exported. Still their condition remains abysmal. The black clay pottery was applied for Geographical Indication (GI) tag in October 2013 with support of NABARD of Lucknow and Human Welfare Association

• Product Catalouge Average raw material cost: Rs.95-105 (Approx.) 4.3. Manufacturing Process: Indian Black Pottery is made at Nizamad in Azamgarh district. The products made include Vases, decorative pieces and Flower Pots. • The pottery is made with locally available fine textured clay. • The clay moulds are prepared in different shapes and are backed in kiln. • Later these clay wares are washed with powdered vegetable matter and are rubbed with mustard oil. The lustrous black pottery is rubbed with special oil and then fired twice. • They are decorated with floral and geometric patterned grooves using sharp twigs. Various beautiful floral and geometric designs are then itched to it. The block surface with its silvery design has an uncanny resemblance to the bidri metal ware, the matt black of the base offset by the silver sheen of the designs. • They are smoke fired with rice husks in enclosed kilns which gives its unique shiny black surface. • The deep black colour is obtained by mixing the local clay with mustard oil seed cake. The silvery ornamentation on the pottery is done by rubbing an amalgam of mercury and tin into the etched and baked patterns on the pots, thereby producing the silvery tracery. The products made have huge demands in the international market as well as the national urban markets.

• The pottery is found to be decorated by painting, stamping, making incisions, molding and appliqué designs. Mainly the decorations consist of horizontal lines, loops, diamonds, circles, triangles, crises- cross, human, animal and bird motifs, rosettes, floral designs and a variety of religious symbols. But during the post- Gupta period, this decorated pottery lost its charm and color. Processing of Clay: Cleaning, Mixing & Kneading Throwing: sentring,coning, raising up, plunging, drawing, thinning the wall, forming, collaring, smoothing, cutting off & removing Beating & Enlarging Finishing & Decorating: Polishing and painting Throwing or modeling by hand may provide only shape to the pot which requires further treatment in to a finished product. In such cases, the last stage of manufacture includes such various processes as shaving, slipping, polishing, engraving, stamping and inlay.

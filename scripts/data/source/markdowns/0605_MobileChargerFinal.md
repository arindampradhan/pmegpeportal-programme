MOBILE CHARGER 1. INTRODUCTION A mobile charger, or recharger, is a device used to put energy into a cell phone or electronic gadget forcing an electric current through it. A typical mobile phone charger consist of charger cabinet, controller PCB, Cable with connector pin. A typical mobile phone charger is rated at anywhere between 3-7 W while charging. Which means even if your phone takes 2 hours for charging it will just consume 0.006 to 0.014 units or k Wh of electricity to charge. USB-A, USB-B, USB-C are some types of USB mobile chargers. Different types of mobile chargers are available now a days like wall chargers, car chargers, desktop chargers, green chargers etc. This mobile charger circuit mainly consists a Transformer, Rectifier and a voltage regulator IC. This circuit can be divided into four parts: (1) Step down AC voltage (2) Rectification (3) Filtration (4) Voltage Regulation. Step down AC voltage – A Transformer is an electrical device that trades voltage for current in a circuit, while not affecting the total electrical power. This means it takes high-voltage electricity with a small current and changes it into low-voltage electricity with a large current, or vice versa. Rectification- It is the process of removing the negative part of the Alternate Current (AC), hence producing the partial DC. Diodes are used for this. Filtration - The output after the Rectification is not a proper DC. For this Capacitor are used. Capacitor will charge till the waveform goes to its peak and it will discharge into load circuit when waveform goes low. So when output is going low, capacitor maintains the proper voltage supply into the Load circuit, hence creating the DC. Voltage Regulation- A voltage regulator IC 7805 is used to provide a regulated 5v DC. The output of the voltage regulator connected to the USB female pin from there we can connect it to cell phone.

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL • Mobile charger is used to charge mobile phone. • It can also be used to charge other electric devices like Tablet, Power banks, to charge rechargeable torch etc. • This DC supply can also be used to charge power source for digital circuits, breadboard circuits, ICs etc. • Used to operate device that take 5v DC input. The global market for mobile chargers should grow from $18.1 billion in 2017 to $25.0 billion by 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% during the forecast period of 2017-2022. Mobile chargers created in India can possibly catch around 50% of the worldwide market under the government’s new scheme for electronic producers, a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India. When it comes to explore in the business market, there is a ton of interest on the lookout. The mobile charger market is acquiring energy because of the developing number of cell phone users, rising disposable income and government strategies for solar based chargers, etc. The mobile charger is the most generally utilized gadget across the globe because of expanded reception of electronic vehicles, electronic devices, and different gadgets. Electronic gadgets/devices such as mobile phones, tablets, cameras, laptops, head gear, and so on, which drain batteries at faster rates, will create significant demand for mobile chargers in the near future. That is because nowadays everyone has smartphones. In today's time all work is done in digital form. In which, when there is a need for a mobile phone. Now it is clear that if the mobile phone is used more than people will charge more. So these days, with the increase in the demand of mobile, the demand for mobile charger has also increased a lot. People also use it quite a lot. Then, whether it is a city or a village, its demand is very high everywhere. Whenever someone's mobile is discharged, that person first goes to the mobile shop and purchases a charger. The special thing about this business is that this business is not run at any particular time, this business can run at any time. Now you can guess from this how much demand is there in the market. You can start it in any month of the year and anytime. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT 1. Plastic: Plastic granules can be used to form charger cabinet. 2. Charger cable with connector pin- PVC material cable is used for mobile charging. The cable comes with attached connector female USB pin.

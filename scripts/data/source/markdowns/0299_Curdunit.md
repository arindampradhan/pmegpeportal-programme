2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 Raw Material Milk is required as the major raw material for the manufacturing of curd. Average raw material (cost per Liter): Rs. 40-45 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Curd Manufacturing Process Step1: Procurement Procurement of raw milk. Step 2: Milk Reception Area After procurement step bring the milk to the milk reception &cool the milk, so that life span of the milk can be increased & it can be used for further processing. Step 3: Pasteurization After that the main processing of by product starts & put the cooled milk into the inoculation tank and boil the milk at 80o C - 90o C (depends upon the pasteurization). Then again cool it at 4o C. Pasteurization machines are of two types: 1. Slow online pasteurization 2. Continuous online pasteurization

Step 4: Homogenization • We used Offline cream separator with pasteurization machine this helps to remove fat from milk and used for the production of the milk. • Online homogenizer is attached with the pasteurization machine. This breaks the fat part and mixed in the milk. • It is used for manufacturing of curd. Step 5: Distribution of pasteurized milk in different tanks It consists of different tanks which are categorized according to the fat content. After that milk is transferred into different sections like pouch milk, curd processing, paneer processing. Curd Milk is boiled at 92o C and then we thermize it & add culture into that. Step 6: Packaging Prepared curd is then transferred into the packaging section Step 7: Cold room All the product are transferred into cold rooms where the temperature is below 4o C Step 8: Distribution All final products are transferred through transportation into different areas. Insulation vehicle is required if the final product is transported above 40 – 50 KM.

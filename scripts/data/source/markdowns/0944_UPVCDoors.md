UPVC DOORS Introduction: UPVC, also known as Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride, is a low maintenance building material used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for window frames and doors. UPVC is a cheaper alternative to expensive hardwood timber and aluminium. It is a popular material due to its durability and it is a cost-effective option. UPVC is proven to offer excellent performance and durability; it is long-lasting and requires very little maintenance making it the perfect material for doors and windows. It is also recognized for its thermal efficiency, sound insulation, and great value for money.

Features of UPVC Doors: 1. One of the best properties of u PVC is that it is incredibly strong despite being lightweight, and u PVC doors can be secured with multi-point locking systems. 2. UPVC is very easy to install, remove, repair and reinstall, and all this can be done without causing any structural damage to your walls or columns. 3. . When combined with the right noise-cancelling door or window glass, UPVC is highly effective in providing acoustic insulation to your retail store. 4. UPVC as a material is extremely efficient at keeping external heat at bay, providing a strong insulating layer between the outdoors and the indoors. UPVC Doors Market analysis: The Indian u PVC doors market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.0% during 2015-2020. The major drivers of the Indian u PVC doors market are increasing new housing construction and replacement activities, which have contributed to the growth of this market. Another important factor that drives this market is their tangible and intangible benefiting features, such as the u PVC doors are thermal, and water- and wind-resistant. They are corrosion-free. These doors are termite free, highly sound insulated, dustproof, highly durable, and need no maintenance. They are energy efficient and could save energy up to 25% to 30%. Manufacturing process: The raw material is procured from the authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. At first, the PVC resin, stabilizer, lubricant, and coloring pigment is added to the Pellet mixer in the required ratio. The mixer rotates at high speed to spread the pellets evenly. The profile dies are mounted at the end of the extruder to give the desired shape of the UPVC structure profile; after approval from the production department. After this, the barrel heaters are started and brought to the

desired temperature and pressure. The raw material is fed into the hopper of the extruder. From the hopper, these plastic pellets come into the feed section of the barrel. There is a screw inside the barrel which rotates about the vertical axis and compresses the pellets along its length. Pellets get melts down and flown plastically out through the extruder. This molten plastic is fed into shaped and drawn dies having the desired profile of the structure. After this, cooling and solidification of the molten plastic are performed using suitable cooling arrangements. After this, the solidified UPVC structures are fed into a cutting machine where these structures are cut down as per the desired length with allowable tolerance and stored in the inventory. In the next step, the sheet metal roll is brought from the inventory and fed into the sheet metal slitting machine. The sheet roll is arranged in such a way that one end of sheet roll is fed through the machine and the remaining coil set will unfold as the sheet fed through the machine. This machine cuts the sheet into fine strips along its length as per the desired width. Rotary cutters are arranged at precise locations to perform slitting operation. These fine strips of slitting sheets are winded over rolls using sheet winding machine. In the next step, these slitting sheets are fed into the Automatic roll forming machine. There is an arrangement of a series of rollers, with each of these rollers adding shape to the metal. The rolls work together and precisely produce very high volumes of the reinforced sheets of the desired cross section. After this finished MS sheets are fed into cutting machine where the rotary cutter cuts the sheets as per the desired length. In the next step, these reinforced sheets are fed into punching the press to punch the desired slots at the required location. In the next step, drilling is performed as per the desired profile over the surface of the UPVC structure for routing and drainage. This helps the removal of rainwater from the surface. Automatic Multi-axis drilling machines are used to perform these operations. In the next step, these reinforced sheets are inserted into UPVC structures and fixed firmly with screws. Torque guns are used at sufficient speed to impart the desired momentum in the screws. After this, welding of the reinforcement sheets is performed using the UPVC welding machine as per the desired profile of doors. The welding machine holds the parts to be weld and uses high-frequency acoustic vibrations to produce dynamic shear stress with frictional heat generation. This leads to

plastic deformation and weld formation. After this, these welded sheets are fed into the UPVC profile cleaning machine to trims off the burr, weld slag, and excess material. In the next step, an oil gasket is pasted firmly at the corners and faces assembled sheets using a gasket tool. The gasket acts as a seal to make the doors sound and waterproof. In the next step, door handles, latches, locks are assembled using screw and torque gun. After this glass cutting is performed as per the desired profile of the doors and windows using a glass cutting tool. The glass beads are cut at an angle of 45° using a glass beading cutting machine. These glass and glass beads are assembled to the doors using suitable glazing and gasket seals. In the next step, these doors are precisely checked as per the desired quality standards. After this, they are safely packed and dispatched in the required quantity. Machinery Requirement: Basic machines and equipments are as follows: Name Cost(Rs.) Double head cutting machine 480000 Glazing bead Cutting saw 80000 Manual end Milling Machine 55000 Portable Copy Router 45000 Manual tool for cleaning pneumatic 17500 Manual tool for water slot 10500 Manual V Welding tool 18000 Sub Total 706000 GST@ 18% 127080 Total Machine cost 833080 Raw material Requirement: Major raw material requirements are: 1.

4. Rubber Gasket 5. Mosquito Mesh 6. Wheel for smooth sliding 7. Lockers etc.. This project report is prepared by taking the average size of UPVC Door to be 24sqft. (6*4 sqft.). Average raw material cost per square feet is approx. Rs 130. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1200 to 1500Sqft. Civil work will cost around 5 Lac (approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40 hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 7 including 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 security Guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and sales personal each.

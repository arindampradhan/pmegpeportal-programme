BANANA FIBRE EXTRACTION PLANT Introduction: Banana fibre, also known as musa fibre is one of the world’s strongest natural fibres. Biodegradable, the natural fibre is made from the stem of the banana tree and is incredibly durable. The fibre consists of thick-walled cell tissue, bonded together by natural gums and is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Banana fibre is similar to natural bamboo fibre, but its spin ability, fineness and tensile strength are said to be better. Banana fibre can be used to make a number of different textiles with different weights and thicknesses, based on what part of the banana stem the fibre was extracted from. The thicker, sturdier fibres are taken from the banana trees outer sheaths, whereas the inner sheaths result in softer fibres. Banana fibre is more sustainable alternative to silk. Although not many people are aware of its existence or use, banana fibre is not a recent innovation. The fibre consists of thick-walled cell tissue, bonded together by natural gums and is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Consists of thick-walled cell tissue, bonded together by natural gums and is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. But using banana trees as a source of fibre to make textiles declined as other fibres such as cotton and silk from China and India became increasingly popular. But now banana fibre is making a comeback in the fashion industry.

Uses & Market Potential: Banana fibre is the natural fibre made out of banana stems used to make handicrafts, ropes, sarees and other garments. Banana fiber is considered to be next revolution in many industries such as textiles and automobile interiors. Some artisans use the fiber to make ropes, handbags, sarees and a variety of handicraft items. But banana papermaking seems to be the only avenue for utilizing this resource most appropriately. If all the banana plants were harvested and their fibre extracted from the trunk, around 2.1 lakh tonnes of the fibre would be available per annum, yielding 1.65 lakh tonnes of handmade paper. Currently, banana fibre is widely used as blending material in the textile sector. There's a high demand for it in countries like United States of America, Malaysia, Korea, European Union and Philippines. Japan's currency, the Yen, is made out of banana fibre. So, exporting banana fibre will bring substantial foreign exchange to India. Product: BANANA FIBRE YARN Raw Material: 1. Dried Banana Sheath 2. Rubber Mat 3. Thread 4. Colours for Dyeing 5. Salt

membrane on the right-hand side. The left-hand membrane has a distinct coating on the inner surface. This coating is a mixture of tar, clay and sand which drops the pitch and provides a well-defined tone. Echoing, the body has two apertures of different size, one, small, that will generate high pitched sounds and another, wider, for low pitched sounds. The walls of the instrument are thick and give it stability in the low frequencies. These two skins are stretched together by iron clad. 3. MARKET POTENTIAL: There are around 300 little units creating wood based drum instrument (Dholak) in the region, which give work to more than 1000 craftsmans.

 These seasoned wooden blocks are transformed to barrel shaped dholaks using wooden lathe and hand tools.  Different designs are crafted over the surface of wooden blocks.  After this, the sides of the Dholak are covered with leather sheet cap which is known as membrane. The sheets are made from leather or plastic, which is attached to the Dholak to produce sound.  After this, the external surface of the wood barrel is smoothened and finished. The calfskin sheet is cut into roundabout shapes according to required sizes and absorbed water for 30 minutes before it is joined to the bamboo ring.  After this, Mixture of harika stone powder and Maida starch mixed with engine oil and applied at the center of the leather sheets. This mixture is applied to get the required sound from the instrument. Metal rings are arranged on the membrane to park the places from where the rope is inserted.  Now, the thin strips of bamboos are cut and converted into bamboo rings. Bamboo ring is placed on the soaked leather sheet and the sides of the leather is curled in the bamboo ring.  Once the marking is made, hole is made in the respected place using a pointed chisel.  A Cotton rope of about 5 to 6 meters is passed through the holes and tied with the metal ring in zigzag manner from chatti to the base.  After tying the rope is pulled and tightened to stretch the membrane. The finished article is tested by the artisan and sold in the market.

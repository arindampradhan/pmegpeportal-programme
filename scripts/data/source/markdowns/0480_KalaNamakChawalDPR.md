KALA NAMAK CHAWAL PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Kalanamak is one of India's finest scented quality rice. Its name comes from the black husk (Kala=black; namak means salt). Since Buddhist times this variety is being cultivated (600 BC). It is also well known as the scented black pearl of Uttar Pradesh, in Himalayan Tarai in eastern Uttar Pradesh. It was featured by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as part of the book 'Specialty rice of the world. In 2012 the Government of India granted Kalanamak Rice the Geographical Index (GI) Tag and the geographical area was defined to allow for the production of Kalanamak Rice. In this defined area, only Kalanamak rice can be labeled as Kalanamak rice. Even the most exclusive Basmati rice with all qualities, except for grain length, is said to have outshined kalanamak rice. Kalanamak is short- to medium-length non-basmati rice. The aroma is more powerful than any of the Basmati variants and the Kalanamak rice is said to be the gift of Gautama Buddha. Elongation after cooking, after cooking is 40 percent more than the Basmati rice which is one of the most important quality features on the international rice market. Cooked kalanamak is softer and fluffier than other types of rice. Uses & Market Potential: India has an enormous abundance of aromatic rice varieties and landraces of Basmati and non-Basmati that show wide variability in their grain quality and cooking characteristics. Kalanamak is an important and popular aromatic rice species cultivated in East Uttar Pradesh, among non-basmati aromas.

Their taste and aroma are renowned. It is cooked in eastern India or given as a present to a guest. While Kalanamak is rapidly abandoned, if it is promoted properly, this is an Indigenous Aromatic Rice Species that offers a huge promise not only on the internal market but also as a commodity for exports. It may be a boon to Eastern Uttar Pradesh farmers and the Bihar Tarai region. Iran and Saudi Arabia are India's largest basmati rice importers, accounting for the majority of the country's overall basmati rice export value. In the last five years, the Indian domestic rice market has grown at a CAGR of over 4%. Non-basmati rice holds a larger share of the Indian rice market than basmati rice because basmati rice production is limited to only a few states and is considered premium rice. Increased urbanization is playing an important role in developing India's packed rice market, which is shifting from an unorganized to an organized market that is growing at a CAGR of nearly 12% consumer awareness. Basmati rice dominates the packed rice market in India, as do new healthy rice segments such as brown rice and organic rice, whose demand has risen in recent years. Product: KALA NAMAK RICE Raw Material: Kala Namak rice varieties are the only raw material required for the milling plant. It is easily available in the market.

INTRODUCTION A solar lamp or lantern is a portable light fixture composed of an LED lamp, a photovoltaic solar panel, and a rechargeable battery. Outdoor lamps may have lamp, solar panel and battery integrated in one unit. Indoor solar lamps with separately- mounted solar panels are used for general illumination where centrally generated power is not conveniently or economically available. Solar-powered household lighting may displace light sources such as kerosene lamps, saving money for the user, and reducing fire and pollution hazards. Solar lamps recharge during the day. Automatic outdoor lamps turn on at dusk and remain illuminated overnight, depending on how much sunlight they receive during the day. Solar garden lights are used for decoration, and come in a wide variety of designs. They are sometimes holiday-themed and may come in animal shapes. They are frequently used to mark footpaths or the areas around swimming pools. Some solar lights do not provide as much light as a line-powered lighting system, but they are easily installed and maintained, and provide a cheaper alternative to wired lamps. Solar street lights provide public lighting without use of an electrical grid; they may have individual panels for each lamp of a system, or may have a large central solar panel and battery bank to power multiple lamps. To reduce the overall cost of a solar lighting system, energy saving lamps of either the fluorescent or LED lamp type are used, since incandescent bulbs consume several times as much energy for a given quantity of light. The technology in this sector is undergoing rapid strides of change and there is a need for regular monitoring of the national and international technology scenario. The unit, may therefore, keep abreast with new technologies in order to keep them in pace with the developments for global competition. Quality today is not only confined to the product or service alone. It also extends to the process and environment in which they are generated. The ISO 9000 defines standards for quality management system and ISO 14001 defines standards for environmental MARKET POTENTIAL India is a nation in transition. Considered an "emerging economy," increasing GDP is driving the demand for additional electrical energy, as well as transportation fuels. India is a nation of extremes. Poverty remains in areas with no energy services, while wealth grows in the new business hubs. Coal fired generation currently provides two thirds of the generation capacity, and hydropower supplies the other third. Yet, India is blessed with vast resources of renewable energy in solar, wind, biomass and small hydro. In fact, the technical potential of these renewable exceeds the present installed generation capacity. Unique in the world, India has the only Ministry that is dedicated to the development of renewable energies: the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. This bodes well for the acceleration of renewable development throughout the nation –both to meet the underserved needs of millions of rural residents and the growing demand of an energy hungry economy.

The development and deployment of renewable energy, products, and services in India is driven by the need to • decrease dependence on energy imports • sustain accelerated deployment of renewable energy system and devices • expand cost-effective energy supply • augment energy supply to remote and deficient areas to provide normative Consumption levels to all section of the population across the country And finally, switch fuels through new and renewable energy system/ device deployment. Renewable energy remains a small fraction of installed capacity, yet India is blessed with over 150,000 MW of exploitable renewable. It makes sense that all efforts and investment should consider accelerating these sustainable energy resources before committing to the same fossil fuel path as western nations. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS i. The basis for calculation of production capacity has been taken on single shift basis on 67% efficiency. ii. The maximum capacity utilization on single shift basis for 300 days a year. During first year and second year of operations the capacity utilization is 70% and 80% respectively. The unit is expected to achieve full capacity utilization from the third year onward. iii. The salaries and wages, cost of raw material, utilities, rents, etc. are based on the prevailing rates are likely to vary with time and location. iv. Interest on term loan and working capital has been taken @ 11.50% on an average. This rate may vary depending upon the policy of financial institutions/agencies from time to time. v. The cost of machinery and equipments refer to a particular/make model and prices are approximate. vi. The break-even point percentage indicated is of full capacity utilization. vii. The essential machinery and equipments required for the project have been indicated. The unit may also utilize common facilities available at Electronics Test & Development Centres (ETDC) and Electronic Regional Test Laboratories (ERTLs) set up by state Governments and STQC Directorate of Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to manufacture products conforming to Bureau of Indian Standards.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS CEL SOLAR LANTERN is a versatile and reliable source of lighting. It comprises a Lantern, Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) module and a connecting cable. The SPV module when exposed to sunlight charges the battery in the lantern. This stored energy in the battery is used to operate the lamp when required. Solar Lantern consists of a 7W CFL (light output equivalent to a 40W incandescent lamp) ch can be used for 3-4 hours daily. The system comprises SPV Panel, lantern (with ntenance free lead acid battery) and a detachable connecting cord. SOLAR PV MODULE: A number of high-grade crystalline Silicon Solar Cells, interconnected in a series combination and hermetically sealed with a toughened and highly transparent front glass cover, from the SPV Module. CEL's Solar Lantern is the final and latest answer to many lighting problems. SALIENT FEATURES:  Environment Friendly  Portable  Rugged and Dependable  Silent Operation  Light output 400 lumens i.e. equivalent to a 40 watts incandescent lamp  LED for battery status indication and its safeguard. APPLICATIONS:  Emergency Light Source  Light Source in remote unelectrified villages  Picnic Sports and Farm Houses  Military Outposts  Light sources for the field personnel of Agriculture extension, Adult Education and other Mass Communication Programmers  Garden Lighting SPECIFICATIONS: Solar PV Module: Wattage 10 -12Wp Operation per Day: 3-4 Hrs. Light Source: 7 Watt Compact Fluorescent Lamp Battery: 12 Volt/7AH Sealed maintenance free. Weight: 3.0 Kgs. Approx (Lantern).

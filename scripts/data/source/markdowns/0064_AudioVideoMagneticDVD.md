1. INTRODUCTION Digital versatile disc (commonly abbreviated as DVD) is a digital format for delivering high- fidelity content on a DVD. DVD uses most of the storage on the disc for high-quality data. The first discs entered the marketplace in 2000. DVD was in a format war with CD, and along with consumers' tastes tending towards downloadable music, these factors meant that neither high- quality disc achieved considerable market penetration. DVD has been described as "extinct". Magnetic tape is a medium for magnetic recording made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a tape drive (tape unit, streamer). Magnetic tape revolutionized broadcast and recording. When all radio was live, it allowed programming to be recorded. At a time when gramophone records were recorded in one take, it allowed recordings to be made in multiple parts, which were then mixed and edited with tolerable loss in quality. It is a key technology in early computer development, allowing unparalleled amounts of data to be mechanically created, stored for long periods, and to be rapidly accessed.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES DVD uses most of the storage on the disc for high-quality data. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL  Aluminum metal is used for the housing as well as a hard plastic. The base material of the disks is plastic. They are additionally coated with a silver-colored layer and a thin gold layer. The surface of the disk is further coated with a hard layer of lacquer to protect it.  Polycarbonate: DVD actually made of three layers. Most of a DVD is made from a tough, brittle plastic called polycarbonate. Sandwiched in the middle there is a thin layer of aluminum. Finally, on top of the aluminum, is a protective layer of plastic and lacquer.  Glass: Glass is used as a substrate to hold the DVD master image while it is created and processed; hence the name. Glass substrates, noticeably larger than a DVD, are round plates of glass approximately 240 mm in diameter and 6 mm thick. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Production Process  Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels

at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in; dust-free, neat, and clean environment.  Production Process  Pre-Mastering: It involves creation of a glass master that is placed onto a stamper which is then injected into a mould (shape of a disc) made from polycarbonate substrates. Data is then permanently stamped or "pressed" onto the CD or DVD and the end result is a fully manufactured disc that is playable across multiple platforms.  Glass Mastering: laminate is slit to the desired size it is ready for printing. Artworks provided by customers are processed using sophisticated technology to enable accuracy with the printing of colors and other details on the laminate. Can use the laminate printing machine, Flexi, and Letter Press technology for printing. When the printing process is completed, different colors are merged to give the desired design.  Replicating: Replicating is the process of creating a glass master from your audio and then manufacturing or molding each disc. This is the process used when you purchase a commercially released DVD. Compact disc manufacturing is the process by which commercial DVD are replicated in mass quantities using a master version created from a source recording.  UV Lacquering: Ultraviolet cured lacquering can be applied over ink printed on paper and dried by exposure to UV radiation.  UV Curing: UV-cured coatings provide a number of benefits to plastic part manufacturers, including improved performance, enhanced appearance and various process advantages. Atmospheric plasma provides an especially effective means of enhancing the adhesion of UV cure coatings to a broad range of plastic materials 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000 to 2500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of

project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.15,000 to Rs.20,000 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery Machines-  DVD Pressing Machine: Laminate printing machines are used for customized printing on tubes. These machines are capable of offering exciting effects that cannot be possible with other printing methods.  DVD metallization processing: To form caps for tubes, a hydraulic-horizontal injection molding machine is used. These are being made from plastic granules. Firstly, granules are fed via a hopper into a heated barrel. Where the plastic will be melted at the set temperature. The melted plastic is then injected through a nozzle into a mold cavity where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity and the formed plastic parts will be ejected out. A vertical injection molding machine can be used for shoulder fixing.  U V Lacquering Machine: This machine is used for the capping process. Caps will be automatically fixed with the tube.

LIQUID SHOE POLISH Introduction: Polish are materials, which on one hand, increases the glaze of the treated surface or restore its initial glaze and on the other hand, protect the surfaces against mechanical and chemical effects, and thus prolong the service life of the object. Shoe polish (or boot polish), usually a waxy paste or a cream, is a consumer product used to shine, waterproof, and restore the appearance of leather shoes or boots, thereby extending the footwear's life. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials. Liquid shoe polish is sold in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content. Liquid shoe polish is a complex mixture. Polyethylene wax emulsion is a major component. Various polymers, typically acrylates, are the next major component, conferring gloss and holding the dyes in suspension. Resins and casein are selected to ensure adhesion to the leather. Fatty phosphate esters, emulsifiers, and glycols are also used. Pigments include titanium dioxide for whites and iron oxides for browns.

Other machinery & equipments Ls 185000 Total Amount 1500000 Manufacturing Process: The Carnauba wax and paraffin wax is put in the reactor vessel first and the heaters are turned on, when the wax has melted then solvent naphtha is added. Then the turpentine oil is added, and the mixture stirred on till all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Then while stirring, stearic acid is added followed by addition of oil soluble dye. The Triethanolamine and soft water, obtained from water treatment plant are mixed in a separate reactor vessel, after simultaneous mixing and heating of these two ingredients, Boricin and Water-soluble dye are added one by one and mixed thoroughly. Water based solution is added to reactor vessel with oil-based solution. Vigorous mechanical agitation is very much necessary for uniform emulsification; solution is allowed to cool with constant agitation. The temperature, which in the initial stages is around 110°C is slowly brought down while stirring the mixture properly. The mixture is kept at about 50°C for some time and the stirring continues, then the operator will decide whether all the ingredients have been mixed thoroughly and they will not separate on cooling the liquid mixture to room temperature, the liquid mixture is then cooled to 40°C and stored in a holding tank of bottle filling machine, from where it’s poured in the PVC bottle by the filling machine and bottles are then sealed with the rubber cork with the spreading foam already affixed on the rubber stopper, by a fitting press. These bottles are then capped, from where they are collected in finished product section, where they are checked for quality, packed in cartons and sent for sale.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

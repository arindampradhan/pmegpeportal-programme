SURGICAL ADHESIVE PLASTER INTRODUCTION The plaster are a class of medical treatment tool that are used to support muscle, fascia, ligament, tendons and bones in case of any injury to them; so as to allow them to rest by taking away a portion of their load, thus allowing them to heal or to cover a small portion in case of small wound that don’t require full bandage dressing. Medical Plaster are of various types ranging from adhesive plaster band to plaster cast depending on connective tissue in question and extent of injury; this research work extensively focuses on Adhesive Plasters, whose construction is similar to that of surgical tape but have cotton gauze of finer mesh as base tape material; strength of fabric to be manufactured depends on the type of medical plaster produced.

RAW MATERIAL Bleached Cotton Thread Zinc Oxide based Adhesive Packaging Material MACHINE REQUIRED The manufacturing of Medical Adhesive Plaster requires weaving, roll cutting, roll unwinding, tensioning, coating, drying, roll winding and packaging processes, which are performed in Air Jet Loom and various individual sections of Adhesive Tape Making Machine; thus, the machine required are,

1) Air Jet Loom for Cotton Gauze Loom is a fabric manufacturing machine which is used to weave a fabric, the air jet loom utilizes air jets to insert the weft to form the woven fabric. 2) Adhesive Tape Making Machine The machine has a roll unwinding station, tape alignment and tensioning station, coating station, drying station, roll winding station and tape slitting station; these stations are in general required for any adhesive tape manufacturing.

3) Gauze Bandage Packaging Machine This machine simply packs the adhesive plaster within a plastic packaging. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK / TREND The segment of absorbent and packing gauze surgical dressings is expected to grow worldwide owing to factors such as increasing incidences of road accidents and sports related injuries. Globally raising aging population and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases. In addition, the swift healing times brought about by the usage of wound dressings make them useful during emergency care. The rising incidence of wound infections raises the sale of wound dressings, thus having a positive impact on the market. MANUFACTURING PROCESS The threads of bleached cotton are placed in air jet loom and appropriate settings are made, followed by which it weaves the cotton threads into a cotton plaster fabric; which is also rolled by the machine into large cotton plaster roll. The large cotton plaster roll is then feed to tape roll unwinding section of adhesive tape making machine which simply unrolls the cotton plaster from its roll and feeds it to alignment and tensioning roller section via a set of feed rollers.

## Page 7

Alignment and tensioning section of machine ensures that the plaster sheet is aligned properly so as to avert improper coating of adhesive on plaster, thus the plaster is feed to coating section which applies coating of Zinc Oxide based adhesive onto the plaster uniformly along its width. The plaster is then passed through a drying section, which may use an air drier or air heater, so as to properly dry the applied adhesive, followed by which adhesive plaster is obtained and is feed to tape roll winding section of machine which simply rolls the adhesive plaster back to form a large roll. This roll is then feed to tape slitting section of machine which utilizes an appropriate cutter to simply cut the giant roll into number of adhesive plaster as per the length requirements. Note: An extra section is present in some machines in which a smooth non-stick paper is applied to adhesive side of tape prior to tape roll winding section, so as to prevent stickiness due to adhesive on adhesive free side of tape. These cut Medical Adhesive Plaster Rolls are then, either feed to gauze bandage packaging machine which simply seals these bandages within a packaging or packed manually into appropriate packaging, followed by which they are packed in cartons and sent for sale. MARKET DEMAND The demand for surgical adhesive tape is mainly influenced by population growth, economic growth and expansion of the health sector. The health sector has been given due attention by the government. Due to the favorable environment created for private investment a number of health facilities including hospitals and clinics are being established throughout the country. Medical and health facilities registered an annual average growth of 12.00% approx. over the past four years.

Considering the rapid economic growth and the expansion of health facilities in the urban and rural areas, the demand for adhesive dressings for medical purposes is assumed to grow by 12.00% per annum. UTILITIES Raw Material The required material can be obtained from local Market. Auxiliary materials include labels, packing material and other inputs. Power HP connection load shall be required from the Electricity Board and necessary arrangements for DG Set shall also be required to made 40 available to meet out the inconsistencies arises in case of power failure.

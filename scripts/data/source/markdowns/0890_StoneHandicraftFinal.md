2. INTRODUCTION Shazar is made uniquely at Banda in India. It is made in an old customary design with a wooden bow and a dainty steel wire called 'Kaman'. Stones are mounted over a wooden stand called 'khunta' and cut by this bow with the assistance of silicon carbide powder in 2 to 4mm thickness. These stones cuts are then planned, managed, formed and cleaned with most extreme consideration and accuracy as the testimonies are in micron thickness as it were. The specialty of Shazar Stonework is being drilled in Banda area as it were. Banda is arranged close to the correct bank of the stream Ken in the Bundelkhand district of Uttar Pradesh. Stream Ken is a rich storage facility of the Shazar stones that required great many years to frame. The Shazar stones are Dendritic Agate. The historical backdrop of life and craft of the Shazar stone is antiquated. Banda has been the middle for this stone work for the last 300-400 years. Legend has it that Shazar was found in Banda around 400 years back by a Middle Easterner. Captivated by the tree like examples, he named it Shazar which, in Arabic, implies: tree, plant or bush.

In neighborhood speech it is frequently called shajar, in Urdu, it is called Haqiq and in Hindi Sphatic. In English, Shazar is known as Dendrite Agate The specialty of Shazar Stonework is being rehearsed in Banda area as it were. Banda is arranged close to the correct bank of the waterway Ken in the Bundelkhand locale of Uttar Pradesh. Waterway Ken is a rich storage facility of the Shazar stones that required great many years to shape. The Shazar stones are Dendritic Agate. 3. Market Potential: The Shazar Art industry in Banda Bunch encourages the immediate and backhanded business chance to 150 families and around 1000 individuals. The 150 craftsman families in 60-70 units are occupied with shazar stone specialty at Kahipar, Khutla, Mardannaka territory in Banda. The craftsmans come from various foundations and social constructions like minority, in reverse, underneath neediness line and general local area. Agates are called as 'commemoration stones'. Rings made out of greenery agates are given as commemoration presents for the fourteenth commemoration. It involves pride that this work is just being done at Banda in India. There is extraordinary fare potential as well. In any case, critical to guarantee fitting compensation to the artworks people to help protect and proceed with this art in the solitary spot in India. The specialty is currently being advanced by Legislatures of Uttar Pradesh just as India. Shazar Specialty business is exhibited all over India through fairs and exihibitions at Mumbai, Delhi ,Agra, Khujraho, Surajkund and others. The fairs orchestrated by the public authority are principle commercial center of the Shazar Stone Specialty. Numerous craftsmans have since been regarded at public and worldwide shows.

4. Product Description: 4.1. Product Uses- It is mostly used for ornamental purposes like pendants, ear rings, rings, curio item like paper weights. Pill boxes, sindoordani etc. This art is also used to produce several other items for decorative as well as general use purpose tools /items such as Frames(Photo Frames, Door and window Frames), Sculptures. In this project we have discussed Photo Frames and sculptures made of Shazar Stone. 4.2. Raw Material- Shazar stone, thin steel wire, Silicon Carbide Powder, Paints & Primers. Average raw material cost per Photo Frame will be Rs. 240-300 (Approx.) Average raw material cost per Stone Sculpture will be Rs. 200-260 (Approx.) 4.3. Manufacturing Process: Collecting the stone to forming the gem is a very labour intensive work.  Sourcing: In earlier periods Karkanedaars or factory owners used to set out for days to camp on the river banks. There they would try to source stones that would yield sazar. The collection is often carried out after the rainy season to. When it rains heavily and river and stream of that area gets swept a couple times, the soil gets dissolved and flows over rocks or gets steeped onto the bank of the river. Shazar is hidden with many other stones.

 Chipping: The specialties individual needs to work with a mallet which is utilized to break the stone. The testimonies are found by breaking the strand of each conceivable stone. It is an extremely old and informal strategy. Further chipping may uncover dendrite spots. Just 5% of the stones uncover a decent quality sazar while practically 95% stone ends up being a waste. The great quality stone is then chosen for the following cycle.  Sawing/ Slicing: In the wake of taking it back to the production line, it is firmly arranged and even couple of impressions are opened by scouring the stone. Cutting is done approach the impact on those stones which have Sazar in profound position. The stone is then cut. A spring steel wire of 23 measure is wrapped with a 5 feet in length wood bow hanging 500 grams weight of stone on one side and alumina or silicon carbide powder is blended in with water and applied on the stone and the stone is scoured. This is the cycle which assumes primary part in making the Sazar. The wire cutting the stone close to the Sazar separates the stone into two sections. This is the characteristic creation which is then molded to frame Sazar.  Shaping/ Designing: Then carefully avoiding any fault lines, a design is drawn on the stone with a pencil so that the emerging dendrite is

showcased in the most effective manner. The designs could be round, oval, heart shaped, pentagon, octagon or square. In local language these are referred to as shaping/designing. In local language these are referred to as round (GOL), oval (BAIJA) heart (PAN), octagon (6MAS), square (CHAOCOR). The largest dendrite that has been found in Banda has been about eight inches in diameter.  Chipping: Excess stone outside the penciled deign is carefully chipped away by cutting with a wire or breaking bit by bit with a wrench. The shape of the Shazar is classified in three ways. The best complete, best incomplete and spotty, accordingly their price is fixed- Precious, valuable and inexpensive respectively.  It is also crafted in a very old traditional fashion with a wooden bow and a thin steel wire as string called “KAMAN”. Stones are mounted over a wooden stand called “KHUNTA” and sliced by this bow with the help of silicon carbide powder in 2 to 4 mm thickness. These stone slices are then designed. Trimmed, shaped and polished with utmost care and precision as the depositions are in micron thickness only.  Polishing: The lapped and sanded sazar is now ready for polishing. The stone is polished with Red oxide, Cerium Oxide, Tin Oxide and Chromium Oxide. 5. Project Components: 5.1. Land- The necessary land for stone managing and cleaning is assessed to be around 1500sqft.

5.2. Civil Work-  Workshop Area- This zone incorporates the wheel set up and establishment space for all types of gear, work floor zone, and vital cutting and cleaning. Complete workshop territory is approx. 1000Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials, tooling and storage space and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 300Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region.. Total workshop area is approx 200Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 5.3. Machinery & Tools- Major machines and tools are mentioned below: Stone Machine for cutting up bars of material or Cutting for cutting out shapes in plates of raw machine material. Shaper A shaper is a kind of machine instrument that utilizes straight relative movement between the work piece and a solitary guide cutting device toward machine a direct device way. Grinding The shaped stone is now sent for grinding which is done using the machine. Grindstone can be either iron or silicon carbide grinder. The rough edges are smoothened. Finally the stone is beginning

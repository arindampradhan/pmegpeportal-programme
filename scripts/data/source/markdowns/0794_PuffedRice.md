PUFFED RICE (MURMURA) MANUFACTURING UNIT INTRODUCTION: Puffed Rice or Murmura is one of the very popular fast food of the Country. The paddy is used after gelatinization of starch which will give a better puffing. The parboiled rice is sundried and dehisced and polished. Then the same is soaked in the brine solution for 6 to 7 hours and drained completely and dried in sun light for about one hour for removing the excess moisture. Later the rice is fried at 110 degree celcious and cooled and packed. Puffed rice is a type of puffed grain from the Indian subcontinent, made from rice, commonly used in breakfast cereal or snack foods, and served as a popular street food in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. It is usually made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam, though the method of manufacture varies widely. It is widely consumed in countries like India. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Compared to other ready-to-eat cereals, puffed rice is very low in calories. A 3/4-cup serving of a bran flake cereal has 98 calories, and swapping out your bran flakes for puffed rice can save you 44 calories per serving. If you're trying to lose weight, saving an extra 44 calories a day may help you lose 1 pound every 2 1/2 months. While that may seem like a slow way to lose weight, every little bit helps. Puffed rice, especially the one made from white rice, does

not offer any major health benefit. White rice is produced by removing the bran layer, along with the germ. The manufacturing process of white rice destroys much of the nutrients found in unpolished rice, leaving behind only the endosperm that mainly contains carbohydrates with traces of B vitamins. The process of making puffed rice further lowers the nutritional value of this grain, by destroying the heat-sensitive nutrients. However, some manufacturers do add iron and other vitamins and minerals to puffed rice, in order to compensate the loss of nutrients in the manufacturing process. So, fortified puffed rice can provide some essential nutrients like B vitamins, iron, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. Moreover, it contains negligible amounts of sodium, which is good for regulating your blood pressure. Puffed rice is light and easily digestible. Though it has more volume than regular rice, it contains less calories and almost no fat. So, it can be used as a snack between meals. However, puffed rice is not rich in proteins and fibers and will not keep you full for long. As mentioned already, puffed brown rice is comparatively more nutritious than puffed white rice. Puffed brown rice does contain dietary fiber, and hence, may prove beneficial for maintaining the health of your digestive tract. Brown rice contains a significant amount of B vitamins and minerals, like zinc, manganese, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. Puffs made from brown rice also contains these nutrients, though the puffing process reduces the nutritional value of this grain to some extent. INDUSTRY LOOKOUT AND TRENDS Puffed food segmented by category type, application and region. By category, puffing comes in wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, and ragi. Puffed wheat is prepared by heating wheat grains under pressure and then rapidly releasing pressure when the superheated steam in the grain expands grain is puffed. It is a good source of copper, protein, and iron. Puffed rice used in breakfast cereal or snack foods served as popular street food. It is made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam. Puffed food is segmented by applications as Bakery Industry and Snacks Industry. In bakery it uses in in making puffed backed pancake, puffed baked potato and others. Puffed food market is further segmented by region such as Latin America, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia

Pacific. Latin America and North America possess significant potential, whereas Europe and other developing markets such as Asia-Pacific and MEA possess the growth opportunities for quinoa over the forecast period. There is a high consumption of puffed food in Asia-Pacific regions like India and China as growing young population prefers street food and snacks like cheese doodles. Puffed food provides a multitude of health benefits, as these are rich source of protein, fiber, magnesium, iron, and potassium, and which are anticipated to contribute to the growth of global puffed market over the coming years. Puffed food has low calories which easily gets digested and absorbed quickly which acts as one of the factors of popularity among consumers. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Puffed rice is enriched with extra vitamins and minerals. The refining process used to create the white rice cereal also removes many of the essential nutrients, so manufacturers add iron and B vitamins back into the product. As a result, one cup of puffed rice provides 25 percent of the daily value for iron and niacin and 24 percent for thiamin, based on a 2,000- calorie diet. The cereal also provides 24 percent of the daily value for riboflavin and 10 percent for manganese. It is not a notable source of any other vitamins or minerals. You can use puffed rice to extend your serving sizes of more nutritious cereals. Many healthier cereals contain 150 to 200 calories per 1/2 to 1 cup serving. If you find these servings too small for your appetite, consider stretching them by adding 1 cup of puffed rice, which adds minimal calories, but may help you feel more satisfied. Eating puffed rice alone may leave you feeling hungry sooner because it contains no fiber or protein. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The basic raw material for the unit is RICE.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Rice is first cleaned to remove stones and husk. It is then soaked in brine solution and dried. On drying it is fed into the puffing machine from where the 2 puffed products is obtained. It is cooled and packed immediately to prevent moisture absorption. A traditional puffed rice called muri is made by heating rice in a sand-filled oven. Muri is to rice as popcorn is to corn. The processing involved makes rice less perishable. Mandakki is a staple food in many parts of Rayalaseema, North Karnataka, Odisha, Tripura, West Bengal and Bangladesh. Jhalmuri or Masalemandakki is a very popular preparation made from mandakki (muri). Puffed rice is formed by the reaction of both starch and moisture when heated within the shell of the grain. Unlike popcorn, rice kernels are naturally lacking in moisture and must first be conditioned with steam. Puffed rice can be created by heating the steam-conditioned kernels either with oil or in an oven. Rice puffed in this way is crisp, and known as "crisped rice". Oven-crisped rice is used to produce the Rice Krispies breakfast cereal as well as the crisped rice used in Lion Bars, Nestlé Crunch, Krackel, and similar chocolate bars. Though not as dramatic a change when compared to popcorn, the process and end result are the same. Another method of puffing rice is "gun puffing", where the grain is conditioned to the correct level of moisture and pressurized to around 200 psi (1,400 k Pa). When the pressure is suddenly released, the pressure stored inside the kernel causes it to puff out. This method produces a puffed rice which is spongy in texture. Rice can also be puffed by making a rice dough, and extruding small pellets which are then rapidly heated. The moisture in the dough flash boils and puffs the rice up.

growth of peanuts market. However, peanut is also listed as one of the major allergens due to which its consumption is restricted only amongst the consumers who do not have peanut allergy. On the basis of peanuts form, raw form is found to hold a major share and is calculated to increase at high rate globally based on the oil and flour extracted from the raw form of peanuts. However, the convenience usage of the powder form is supporting the increased demand of the product from consumer’s side. The application of peanut in extraction of peanut oil is found to hold a major share on a global level. Amongst the distribution channels for the sale of peanuts, hypermarket and supermarket’s share is projected to increase at a high rate. Peanut is a potential crop used for the manufacturing of peanut oil, spreads and is often used directly for culinary propose and direct consumption. Peanuts are a rich source of poly unsaturated fatty-acids and hence have a wide application in food industries for the health benefits it imparts. The by-products after peanut processing are also considered to be of industrial use. Peanuts are rich in energy and are a good source of nutrients, minerals, antioxidants and vitamins that are essential for maintaining a healthy body. They are also known to be a rich source of dietary proteins and hence are popularly used amongst the consumers. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Flavored and roasted nuts are heavily used in daily routine and across various industries like peanut butter, nut based chocolates, sweets, and as intermediate to many other food products.

STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries. The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry. The act brought into force in place of the PFA is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "FSSA") that overrides all other food related laws. FSSA initiates harmonization of India's food regulations as per international standards. It establishes a new national regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as "FSSAI"), to develop science based standards for food and to regulate and monitor the manufacture, processing, storage, distribution, sale and import of food so as to ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board where ever it is applicable. All food imports will therefore be subject to the provisions of the FSSA and rules and regulations which as notified by the Government on 5th of August 2011 will be applicable.

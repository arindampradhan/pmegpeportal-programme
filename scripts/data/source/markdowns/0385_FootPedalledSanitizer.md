markets, railway stations, airports, bus stands etc. will witness the inflow of public and installing the Foot Operated Hand wash Dispenser at the entrance of all such establishments will help in eliminating the spread of Corona virus through contact. Considering its features, there is also scope for its installation outsides homes of individuals so that their visitors and they themselves get sanitized before entering. The demand for such equipments is high and will keep on increasing as more and more people will adopt the precautionary route of disease prevention. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Big Pipe 100 mm-Dia 2. Small Pipe ½ Inch-Dia 3. Ground support plate along with foot paddle 4. Readymade L Joints, Strong Industrial spring, Screws, Rope, Welding rods, Small plate(20 mm in length and 60 mm in width), Painting if needed. Machinery Requirement: Major machines & equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Heavy pipe cutter 4 15000 60000 Drilling machine 4 10000 40000 Welding Machine 1 15000 15000 Hand Operated press 1 10000 10000 Painting booth with simple spray 1 80000 80000 gun Hand Grinding Machine 1 5000 5000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 40000 Total Amount 250000

Manufacturing Process: The big pipe with 100 mm diameter is cut in to small 1 m length with heavy pipe cutter. The small pipe with ½ Inch diameter is cut in to small 10 cm length with heavy pipe cutter. The smaller pipe in which readymade L joint will be screwed will be the moving part in the operation and it has to be inserted inside the bigger pipe on which another L joint will be there for supporting the sanitizer. A strong industrial spring has to be connected to the smaller pipe and the bigger pipe through slits made in such a way that the movement is free. The bigger pipe has to be screwed on to the Ground Support Plate. A rope will be attached to the smaller pipe and this will be connected to the foot pedal attached with the ground support plate. A plate will be in screwed near the slits in such a way that the sanitizer bottle could be placed. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs. 2 Lac Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

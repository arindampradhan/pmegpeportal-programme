1. INTRODUCTION Spreads are usually spread onto foods such as bread and crackers, and are thick in nature as it contains fats, healthy vegetable oil and butter. Garlic is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia from where it spread in prehistoric times to the maditerranean region. Clay models of garlic have been excavated in Egypt. It reached China at an early age and was probably carried to the western hemisphere by the Spanish, the Portuguese, and the French. It has been suggested that the wild ancestor of garlic was a flowering form producing seeds on aerial bulbils. Under different soil and climatic conditions, and due to different methods of cultivation in the ancient centres of civilization different varieties arose. The non-flowering varieties are thought to have arisen as a result of interference with the natural life cycle caused by storage. Garlic butter is a very good source of vitamins A, E and K. It is even known to destroy harmful bacterias in our system. Even if it has saturated fats that has no harmful effects on our heart and body, it is a very good replacement for refined oil. Butter is key element in garlic spread. Garlic and butter makes a magic pair. Garlic is a universal herb and butter being an essential condiment in almost every cuisine. Garlic spread is a widely loved compound butter generally used for Italian and continental preparations. Garlic spread is a versatile element that can be used to toss, saute, bake, grill and even as a spread. Apart from cooking purposes, this is often considered as a healthy ingredient which serves multiple health benefits.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Garlic Spread it is easy to make great tasting garlic bread. Simply spread onto bread or rolls and quickly toast or bake until golden brown. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Garlic bread spread Processing  Packing  Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done. And it will stored in neat and clean area for further processing. Garlic Spread Making Process 1. Garlic Clove Separation: The garlic cloves will be separated first by using garlic clove separating machine. A garlic breaking/separating machine is used to separate the garlic bulbs into garlic cloves. It is equipped with standard rubber soft rollers, so the machine imitates squeezing and rubbing action and won’t damage the garlic during the garlic bulb separation process. The separation rates could be as high as 97-98%. Adjustable gaps between the rollers allow to separate garlic bulbs of different sizes too. A built in draught fan helps aspirate the separated garlic skin peels and garlic stem, thus giving separated cloves as the output. Entrepreneur (User) may additionally deploy a garlic bulb conveyor to enable automation in feeding the raw garlic bulbs. Additionally, a horizontal conveyor with controlled speed or a Sorting table may be deployed by user to visually check the separated cloves and to remove infected or damaged cloves. 2. Garlic Peeling: The thin papery skin tightly adhered on Garlic clove is to be removed for

further processing. There are two types of peelers which are generally adopted by industry. In the first abrasion style peeler, the working principle is fairly simple in which garlic cloves are placed into the hopper which transfers them to a stainless steel drum inside which a vertical shaft with rubber pads are rotating. The cloves get in contact with the rubber pads and also with other cloves and the skin get skimmed off and fall (through abrasion process). An inbuilt blower section is placed near the outlet, which blows away the skin to a dust collection box via an aluminum pipe. The peeled cloves are collected in a separate output bin. In another model, the peeling machine adopts pneumatic principle (equipped with compressor), which will not damage the garlic after peeling the skin. The system consists of a cylindrical peeling chamber with an inlet for feeding cloves and an outlet at the bottom for discharge of peeled clove. The chamber has an opening for entry of compressed air. These machines are also generally equipped with a heating system (with auto temperature control) to ensure surface of garlic skin is dry even in humid weather. Because of the strong air flow produced by the air compressor, the cyclone peels off skin of garlic smoothly, with a comparatively lower damage rate. The machine works in such a way that it receives a portion of garlic and instantly releases compressed air, instantly breaking the peels or skin off of the garlic. These are expelled through a mesh and are released below, where a garbage container awaits them. This occurs while the garlic cloves follow a linear path after being cleaned, on the same upper mesh. Entrepreneur (User) may additionally deploy a horizontal conveyor with controlled speed or a Sorting table to visually check the peeled cloves and to remove infected or damaged cloves. Some companies also offer integrated automatic clove separator and peelers as well. 3. Cleaning: Air bubble washing machine is ideal for washing of peeled garlic cloves to remove dirt adhering to the surface. These machines are also generally equipped with jet spraying section to wash garlic clove thoroughly, and the garlic clove is automatically conveyed to spraying section by conveyor mesh belt. The machine can further be equipped with ozone generator for sterilization and disinfection according to user’s requirement. Additionally, an automatic garlic clove air dryer may be deployed by the user. The machine can be used to effectively remove water droplets on the surface of the garlic clove, before it is passed on to crushing section. Flat conveyors may be used to transfer cloves between machines. 4. Roasting: Cleaned and dryied clove then sent for roasting. Where it will be roasted at required temperature. Roasting garlic concentrates the sugars, transforming it into a

caramelized, spreadable, buttery texture, with sweet, deep complex flavors, removing all the sharpness, pungency and bite. It's easier to digest for many people. 5. Grinding and Mixing: The roasted clove then fall into the first rough grinder or crusher mill, where they are roughly ground to form a thick paste. Although it has been ground once, the paste is still rather coarse. Thus, the pulper or finisher further pulverizes the paste to obtain a finely ground paste. It is optional for entrepreneur to deploy two stage grinding system, based on his/her clientele and market trend. The output thus obtained is transferred into a stainless steel blending tank, where preservatives are added to enable a desired shelf life of the product. Spices, Oil, Butter, Salt and other required ingredients will be added in mixture. Transfer pumps may be used to transfer spread paste from Crusher to Pulper and also for transfer to Blending Tank and then to packaging machine. Packaging Once the paste moves to packaging bin, it is packed in desired pack sizes (30 gms, 50 gms, etc) with help of a Automatic form fill seal machine. The initial step is forming the bag/pouch. Depending on the package type, it is taken from a stack or a roll. A single web vertical form fill seal machine work with flexible materials and is typically fed to a coneshaped tube called a forming tube. The film is worked outside the forming tube and sealed to make the package. The package is sealed with a horizontal seal at the top and bottom of the bag with a vertical seal in the back. The next step in the process is filling, which is accomplished by interfacing a filling machine. The machine is programmed for filling, so this step is completely automated. The pre-measured product is dispensed from the machine into the bag. Then, the film is sealed. Finally, the machine seals the package so it can be shipped to stores where it is purchased by consumers. This process typically comes immediately after the filling process. The reason for this is to limit the risk of contamination, which is especially important when packaging food product. Testing Quality control

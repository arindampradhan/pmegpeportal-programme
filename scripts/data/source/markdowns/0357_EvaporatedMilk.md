EVAPORATED MILK PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: Evaporated milk, known in some countries as "unsweetened condensed milk", is a shelf-stable canned cow's milk product where 60% or more of the water has been removed from fresh milk. It differs from sweetened condensed milk, which contains added sugar. There are mainly two types of evaporated milk one is whole evaporated milk and the other one is skim evaporated milk. Just like fresh milk or powdered milk, evaporated milk is a healthy choice. It provides nutrients needed for healthy bones: protein, calcium, vitamins A and D.

USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Evaporated milk is sometimes used in its reduced form, in tea or coffee, or as a topping for desserts. It is also often used to enhance custards, frozen desserts, pie fillings, and rich sauces. If allowed to freeze slightly, evaporated milk can be whipped into a creamy topping. Primarily, this product does not need to be refrigerated and has a much longer shelf life and because of this unique characteristic the demand of evaporated milk is always high. The global evaporated milk market size was valued at USD 4.97 billion in 2018 and is expected to register a CAGR of 2.3% from 2019 to 2025. INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: 1) Land 1800-2000 sq. ft.(approx.) 2) Office Furniture and fixture. MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Basic Machinery requirement are as follows: 1. Weighing Machine

The first thing is to receive the milk and in milk receiving section the milk which is received is first weighed with the help of a weighing machine. Milk is weighed in Kg. 2. Milk Storage Tank In dairy and milk processing industry a bulk milk storage tank is a large storage tank for holding the milk at a cold temperature until it can be picked up by a milk hauler. It is made up of stainless steel and is used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition. 3. Milk Homogenizer This equipment is used in the production of condensed milk in which milk is forced through a small passage at high velocity. This machine reduces fat globule size to a very small size in order to prevent cream formation.

4. Baby Boiler Boilers are basically used in dairy industry for heating of milk and milk pasteurization. Milk boilers ensures good shelf life. It is also said that boilers are heart and soul of dairy industry. 5. Milk Refrigerator Milk refregerators are basically used to store milk and help in the process of cooling which increases the shelf life of the milk and thus prevents it from destroying. It’s made up of stainless steel and it’s also an important dairy farm equipment. 6. Can Filling Machine

## Page 7

This equipment is used to fill the finished product in cans of different sizes. 7. Can Seamer A can seamer is a machine used to seal the lid to the can body. The lid or "end" is usually tinplated steel while the body can be of metal (such as cans for beverages and soups), paperboard (whisky cans) or plastic. During the can seaming process, the seamer chuck holds the can while the rolls rotate around it. 8. Milk Evaporation Tank This equipment is used to heat and thus evaporate the water from milk in a controlled manner.

9. Condenser A condenser's function is to allow high pressure and temperature refrigerant vapor to condense and eject heat. 10. Water Pump It pumps water, using energy to physically transfer water from one place to another. 11. Cooling Tower

## Page 9

It’s a device which cools the water by allowing it to fall through air flow which may be natural or forced so as to achieve evaporative cooling. 12. Sterilization Retort Retort, vessel is used for sterilization of substances that are placed inside them. RAW MATERIAL: Basic Raw material requirement are as follows: 1. Milk 2. Cans 3. Chemicals, Preservatives etc. Manufacturing Process: Process description of Evaporated Milk is defined below: 1. Pre-Warming: This affects both heat stability and viscosity. Previously, a temperature of 203°F for ten to fifteen minutes was used, but now higher temperatures for a shorter time are used to give better heat stability without loss in viscosity.

2. Evaporation: The Milk is then boiled in same evaporation tank in which its pre-warmed until required vaporization of water is achieved. 3. Homogenising: This is usually performed at a pressure of about 2500lbs. per square inch at a temperature of about 130°F. Homogenisation not only keeps the fat evenly distributed, but also increases viscosity. It usually decreases the heat stability slightly. 4. Stabilising: After rapid cooling sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or phosphate may be added at the rate of about 0.25 percent to increase the heat stability. 5. Filling: The greatest care against contamination must be exercised during filling, thus the filling machine is thoroughly cleaned and sterilised immediately after use. 6. Sterilising: The filled and sealed cans are sterilised or autoclaved in a retort at temperature of about 240° F for about twenty minutes.

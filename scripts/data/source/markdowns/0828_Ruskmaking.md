The per capita consumption of bakery products in India, as it stands today, is one to two kg per annum, which is comparatively lower than the advanced countries where consumption is between 10 to 50 kg per annum. The growth rate of bakery products has been tremendous in the both urban and rural areas. The sector has indicated promising growth prospects and has been making rapid progress. TRENDS  Despite a slight slowdown in India’s economy, bakeries continued to perform strongly driving sales of baked goods over 2013. Baked goods is set to register double‐digit value growth of 10% in 2013. The growth of baked goods was driven mainly by the rapid expansion of modern retail outlets across the country. Increasing disposable income levels of consumers, rapid urbanization, the need for convenience and lack of time in urban households helped drive demand for breads, cakes and pastries during 2013. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE  Britannia Industries with an expected retail value share of 9% of the baked goods category proved to be the most successful player in 2013. The company has been expanding its presence and baked goods range aggressively. The company now offers a range of premium and luxury cakes to consumers. Consumers can now place orders for Britannia baked goods products online in select cities which helped propel sales further. PROSPECTS  Baked goods are expected to grow by a constant value CAGR of 2% over the forecast period. Urban regions of India witnessed rapid growth and expansion of modern retail outlets in 2013. However, modern retail outlets such as hypermarkets and supermarkets continued to remain low compared to the overall retail scenario in India. Some of these modern retail outlets also had dedicated sections to bakery products. The range of baked goods available at these stores was more premium and Western in nature. Fresh bread, French baguettes, bread sticks, pizza bases, cakes and various pastries are available in these stores. This trend will continue over the forecast period as premium baked goods sales will be driven by these modern chained retail outlets. Furthermore, the rising numbers of women expected to join the work force together with time‐pressed urban‐dwelling consumers seeking convenience will each drive sales of baked goods. Growth of bakeries and fast food outlets over the forecast period will also help boost sales going forward. The present day consumer looks for new bakery products, better appeal, taste and convenience from bakery foods. With a population of 1 billion plus, India has the largest middle‐income consumers, who demand varieties in food, clothing, transport and improved living standards, also wish to eat out. Opportunities, in abundance, exist in Bakery Cafes and Restaurants, that who cater fast foods, is another fastest growing sector in India. This is a new challenge to baker and he needs to update his information, technology, products and services to meet the changing needs of the Indian consumer. To meet the new challenges, the Govt. of India encourages the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) with very attractive financing schemes, to modernize and up‐grade their units. This has opened up opportunities not only to SMEs but also to those in the bakery trade to supply the new technologies

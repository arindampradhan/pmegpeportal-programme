BAMBOO FURNITURE Introduction: Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plant, whether it is called as green gold, giant grass or woody grass it is one of the amazing raw materials to explore in various ways and means for all kinds of applications. Bamboo is the best material to substitute many applications of wood, steel, plastic etc. Bamboo can be used to produce chairs, sofas, bookshelves, cabinets and tables and is widely regarded as an excellent substitute for wood. It is produced from bamboo components and to the uninitiated eye the furniture is unrecognizable as having been produced from bamboo. A huge range of furniture can be produced, such as tables and chairs, bookshelves, beds, cabinets and recliners. The furniture is durable, practical and has a modern appearance. Bamboo furniture can withstand everyday use. It is far more resistant to damage than traditional hardwoods. This project deals with set of furniture having 4 chairs and 1 table.

Uses & Market Potential: Bamboo furniture can withstand everyday use. Bamboo furniture won’t swell or shrink due to atmospheric changes. For this reason, outdoor furniture made from bamboo withstands the change from humid to dry air and changes in temperature. Bamboo features a fine grain that adds beauty and elegance to any piece of furniture and is available in a wide variety of stains and finishes. Bamboo is also used in commercial places such as hotels, offices, and recreational areas. The global bamboo furniture market size was valued at USD 10.09 billion in 2018 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2019 to 2025. The growth is primarily attributed to rising investments in infrastructure developments coupled with the use of sustainable raw materials for furniture. The market is majorly driven by the rise in residential application. Along with offering aesthetic appeal to interiors, bamboo is gaining significant acceptance as a wood substitute due to its mechanical strength, durability, and easy availability. Rising environmental awareness among wood processing companies is anticipated to drive the adoption of bamboos as a sustainable building material.

Raw materials: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Bamboo 2. Other consumables such as Glue, oil, nail, etc. Assuming average raw material cost per set containing 4 chairs & 1 table is 3000-3800 per set. Manufacturing Process: All bamboo and materials required for production are procured from local vendors. Bamboos are initially cut to manageable sizes using carpenter saws and similar tools and machines. The bamboos are then cleaned of all unwanted materials like leaves & protrude at nodes. Bamboos then as per requirement are seasoned in a seasoning plant as per furniture to be made though much furniture can be made with almost no to minor processing. Bamboos either way are allowed to disperse a portion of their moisture content before actual manufacturing of furniture starts. The next step prior to manufacturing is surface cleaning & smoothening of bamboo using sand paper, tough bamboo is fundamentally smooth, but during processing fibers can exposed, scratches can be formed which are not desirable hence smoothened with sand paper or appropriate machines. Then bamboos are cut in appropriate sizes as per furniture to be made, these parts are assembled into furniture utilizing a combination of nails, glue etc. All the edges of assembled product are once again smoothened prior to its dispatch for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs. (Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp.

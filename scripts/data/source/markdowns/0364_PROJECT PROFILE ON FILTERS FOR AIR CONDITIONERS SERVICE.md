# 0364 Project Profile On Filters For Air Conditioners Service

## Page 1

"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" Project Profile on Filters for Air Conditioners service Introduction : The project envisages manufacture of absolute filters capable of filtering and purifying air supply to 0.3 microns. Essentially these use woven and non-woven paper filter elements. Although the filters are supplied with the original equipment, a very good replacement market exists especially in cities & urban areas where higher levels of pollution make for regualr replacement market. The demand arises mainly from air conditioning requirements of hospitals, factories and laboratories besides households and hotels. Raw materials required for the Filters for Air conditioners are CRCA sheetss, aluminium foil, fibre glass filter, paper, wire mesh, adhesives, cutting tools and packing materials. Process of Manufacture: The CRCA sheet is formed to hape by pressing. The body , filter element, wire mesh and filter paper are assembled as per design and fixed to the body of the filter. The completed filter is tested for performance as per BS-2831. Market Potential : Air conditioners have assumed the role of a common consumer durable in urban areas. With the increase in utilisation of this equipment, the demand has constantly been increasing, both from original equipment manufacturers and for the replacement market. 1 Name of the Product : FILTERS FOR AIR CONDITIONERS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.ft On rent Rs. 24,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 700,000.00 Hand shearing machine, Folding machine, spot welding apparatus, pleating machine for filter paper, centre lathe, bench grinder, hand tools, jigs, press and fixtures.

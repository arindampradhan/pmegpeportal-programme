BLOOD BAGS Introduction: Blood Bags are the apparatus for the contamination and coagulation free collection, storage and infusing of whole blood. It comprising a deformable hermetically sealed bag to contain the blood, a diaphragm- sealed delivery tube on the bag and adapted to receive a seal-piercing coupling needle to afford egress from the bag, and a collecting line comprising flexible tubing. The blood bags are manufactured from bio-compatible PVC, compounded with suitable additives. Blood bags must be flexible to permit filling(blood collection), transfer of components (expression), and complete emptying (transfusion) without the need to vent. Blood bags must also be able to withstand exposure to low temperatures, e.g., during the preparation of fresh frozen plasma in which temperatures down to –70°C can be encountered. Blood bag plastics cannot contain any toxic substances that could enter the transfusion product and possibly harm the patient.

Blood Bag Market was valued at $279 million in 2016, and is estimated to reach at $580 million by 2023, registering a CAGR of 11.0% from 2017 to 2023. The volume of disposable blood bag market was 275 million units in 2016 and is expected to reach by 556 million units by 2023, registering a CAGR of 10.5%. Disposable blood bag can be defined as a sterile, clear, plastic device employed for transfer, storage, collection, and transfusion of blood and its components. The blood bags are used for efficient handling of blood cells, plasma collection. Double Blood Bag is designed for the collection and separation of whole blood into two different blood components, plasma and red cells. Triple Blood Bag is designed to separate whole blood into three blood components; red blood cells, platelets and plasma through the process of centrifugation and extraction. Triple top and bottom blood bags are used to collect and separate three different blood components: plasma, red cells and buffy coat. Raw material: Basic raw materials are as follows: 1. PVC DEHP Pellets 2. PVC DEHP Tubing Raw Material Requirement: S No. Raw Material Quantity Rate Value 1. PVC DEHP Pellets 32000 kg 95 3040000 2. PVC DEHP Tubing 300000 pcs 25 7500000 .

Manufacturing Process: Blood Bags are available with single bag, double bag or triple bag system in the market. In this context report the single blood bag manufacturing is discussed. In the first step, the PVC DEHP free pellets are procured from the authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the PVC blown films are manufactured for sealing. Since the manufacturing of blood bags requires a set of predefined measures to avoid any contamination, all the process are carried out in a clean and healthy environment. At first, the PVC pellets are poured into the hopper of the extruder. The profile dies of circular shape for the blown film is mounted at the end of extruder. After this, the barrel heaters are started and brought up to the desired melting temperature of the PVC. These pallets present in the hopper are passed into the barrel which is the feed section of the extruder. There is a single or double screw arrangement inside the barrel of the extruder. The screw rotates in a very close fitting with stationary barrel. The resultant force on the material causes it to move forward in the barrel. It heats up as it moves, both from frictional heat generation and heat generated by heating element present in barrel of extruder. These pellets soon begin to melt and this melting continues along the screw until no more solid remains. The pressure and temperature at the exit of the extruder have been set. When the desired glass transition temperature has been reached, the melt is forced through a die by extruder into the film blowing machine. In this machine forming die is shaped like a circle and air pressure is used to further expand the film. After it is expanded to the desired dimensions, it is cooled to solidify the polymer. The cooled PVC sheets polymer gets rolled on over by the rollers. In the next step, the PVC blown film is fed into cutting machine. This machine cuts the PVC sheets as per desired dimension. In the next step, these bags are

fed into PVC welding machine. Profile dies as per the dimension of blood bag is mounted into the machine. The dies have the provision for the placement of PVC tubing while welding the bags. The PVC films are welded as per desired shape of the die. The excess linings are trimmed off and get separated. After this, blood bags arebe sterilized with high-pressure steam. This is because of the presence of anticoagulant and preservative solutions that are degraded on exposure to radiation or gas. Blood bags are typicality autoclaved at 115°C to 120°Cfor 30 to 60minutes. In the next step, the blood bags are quality tested. Blood bags must also be able to withstand exposure to low temperatures, e.g., during the preparation of fresh frozen plasma in which temperatures down to – 70°C can be encountered. After this they are packed and dispatched as per required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 - 1400Sqft. Civil work will cost around Rs. 4 Lac (Approx.) Machines: 1. Extruder– Extruder are used to melt the plastic pellets in a high volume manufacturing process. The plastic material is melted with the application of heat and extruded through die into a desired shape. A cylindrical rotating screw is placed inside the barrel which forces out molten plastic material through a die.

2. Film Blowing Machine – The film blowing machines are used for the producing films or sheets into a viscous liquid between rotating screws and barrels of the extruder. This allows for the polymer to be fed through a die that shapes it in the form of a tube. This tube is then carefully inflated, so there is no risk of tearing, into a bubble by injecting it with air. 3. Cutting Machine –This machine is used to cut the PVC sheets as per desired shape of the bags dimension.

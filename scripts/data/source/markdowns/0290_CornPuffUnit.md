CORN PUFF MAKING (FULLY AUTOMATIC) WHAT IS CORN PUFF? Puffcorn or Corn puffs are puffed or extruded corn snacks made with Corn meal and baked. Products by the name of puffcorn (instead of the more generic term corn puff) in particular can be made to look similar to popcorn, although the latter is made from whole grains. Puffcorn is an extruded puffed corn snack which belongs in the snack group products made with corn grits, rice, wheat, or other cereals. Puffcorn is often flavored with cheese, oil, Chili, Onion or garlic powder, and many other spices. Types of puffcorn can vary between specific length, higher bulk density, lower lightness, higher redness, lower yellowness, higher hardness, and lower springiness, gumminess and chewiness when using different percentage of oat flour.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS Puffcorn, much like other puffed products such as cereals and crispbreads are processed by Extrusion cooking through an extruder. This is a thermodynamic process where the dough is passed through a tube and heated under a certain amount of pressure. The puffcorn dough product is then forced through a narrow opening called a die, and as it gets released, the change in pressure and temperature causes the product to puff out, giving the texture and consistency of puffcorn. The different shapes and textures of puffcorn are manipulated by the die at the end of the extruder and the type of extruder used. Specific types of grain size of the starch required during processing also depends on the snack type itself, for example; if the puffcorn snack requires a fine structure with small pores an extruder with smaller granulation should be used whereas crispier puffcorn would require larger granulation. PACKAGING OF MANUFACTURED CORN PUFF Factors that are considered to determine the packaging material of extruded snacks like puffcorn are Water Vapor transmission rate, Oxygen Transmission rate, optical density and Flavor/odor barriers property. The packaging of choice ultimately compromises between protective properties, shelf life of the product, aesthetic appeal, and cost. Given that deterioration of Puffcorn products is primarily attributed to loss of crispness, it is crucial that the packaging provides a barrier against water vapor. Oxygen barrier requirements for the packaging of puffcorn may be less stringent as extruded and puffed snacks can be less sensitive to oxygen in comparison with fried snack foods. A variety of materials can be used in packaging of puffcorn, examples of which include Low Density Polyethylene, Laminated Pouches and Oriented Polypropylene.

ABOUT THE MARKET SCENARIO‚ÄêPUFFED FOOD MARKET Puffed food has a primary role in human consumption. Consumer demand is increasing for puffed food due to various health benefits such as weight loss, therefore increasing the market share of puffed food market. Increasing demand for flavor food products is expected to increase the puffed food market over the forecast period. Consumers believe in ready to eat products which have high nutrients like popcorns and Cheetos. The growing puffed market attributed to the shift in consumer demand for various flavors and nutritious food. Puffed food is segmented by category type, application and region. By category, puffin comes in wheat, rice, sorghum and ragi. Puffed wheat is prepared by heating wheat grains under pressure and the rapidly releasing pressure when the superheated steam in the grain expands, then grain is puffed. It is good source of copper, protein and iron. Puffed rice used in breakfast cereal and snack foods served as popular food street food. It is made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam. Puffed food is segmented by applications as bakery Industry and Snack Industry.

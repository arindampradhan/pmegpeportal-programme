VETIVER OIL Introduction Vetiver is a species of tropical grass, known as khus. There are two types of vetiver grass: one originated from North India and one from South India. It is important to distinguish between the two types as the South Indian type is domesticated and is therefore found all over the world, whereas the North Indian type is wild and can become a weed. Vetiver essential oil, also called khus oil, is extracted from the vetiver plant, a clumpy, green grass native to India that can grow five feet high or more. Vetiver is in the same family as other grasses used for their essential oils, including lemongrass and citronella. Vetiver oil is quite fragrant, with a distinctive sharp and earthy scent you may recognize from men’s cologne. Vetiver essential oil is distilled from the vetiver plant’s roots, which are aged before being soaked in water. The highly concentrated oil that is released is then skimmed off the top of the water. It’s used in holistic practice for its soothing, grounding capabilities. History of vetiver oil Derived from the aromatic roots of the Vetiveria zizanioides (Linn), Vetiver Essential Oil has come to be known as both the “Oil of Tranquillity” and “The Fragrance of the Soil” in India and Sri Lanka, due to its grounding, sensuous, and deeply calming scent. Vetiver belongs to the Grass family, and is sometimes referred to as Vetivert and Khus. Since ancient times, almost the entire Vetiver plant has been used for various applications including the making of perfumes, soaps, and cosmetics. Used in foods and drinks, Vetiver made a cooling beverage and sorbet flavouring. In tropical countries, Vetiver roots were traditionally used in the production of homemade evaporative

How does Vetiver oil works Since essential oils are extremely potent, vetiver oil to be diluted with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil. You can start with one drop to one to three teaspoons of carrier oil. With caution, increase the essential oil as needed. Vetiver oil works in vapour therapy16 – it can address nervous complaints, dispel anger and irritability, and relieve insomnia this way. It can also be blended in a massage oil or diluted in the bath. Through this mode of administration, it can assist with mental and physical exhaustion, nervous complaints, rheumatism and arthritic pain, and skin healing. This essential oil also works in a cream or lotion, moisturizing and nourishing skin. It especially benefits dry, irritated, and dehydrated skin, and helps reduce wrinkles and stretch marks. On the other hand, it is generally NOT recommended to be taken internally.

Essential oil market is expected to surpass 370 kilo tons by 2025. Vetiver oil is extensively utilized in the perfume industry for manufacturing incense, scents and colognes. Increasing personal grooming trend owing to rising disposable incomes would propel vetiver oil market growth. Asia-Pacific led by Japan, India and China may witness substantial gains in the forecast timeframe. The global vetiver oil market size is expected to reach USD 88.0 million by 2027, expanding at a revenue-based CAGR of 9.4%, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The market is expected to witness surging product demand owing to its increasing applications in pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and fragrance. Extraction of vetiver essential Oil The techniques for extraction of essential oils from plant matter can be classified into three techniques: continuous conventional, discontinuous conventional and non-conventional. The type of extraction method used directly affects the quality, yield and odour of the essential oil. The steps below describe the mass transfer mechanism for the extraction of essential oils from plant material. 1. Constant extraction rate – The external surface of the particles (plant material) are completely covered with oil. 2. Falling extraction rate – Phase where the external surface oil has been depleted by mass transfer into the extracting fluid and the surface area of the particles are only partially covered. 3. Diffusion period – No oil is present on the external surface of the particle and hence diffusion occurs. According to survey, 70% of extracted oils are extracted in the constant and falling rate extraction periods of which 50% is extracted in the constant rate period. Therefore the process can be modelled considering convective processes only. However, vetiver

roots do not easily yield oils as the oils are located in the inside root tissue and hence the slow physical process of diffusion must occur before oils are extracted. Processing of vetiver oil 1. Employed Process The manufacturing process utilized in this project is Distillation Process to extract Vetiver Grass’s Root Oil. The Distillation Apparatus is used to obtain 2 products High Density & Low Density Vetiver Oil utilizing specialized separator. Field Distillation Unit is used to separate the oil within the material at field side; it’s a simple distillation unit which is utilized to separate oil & water within the crop, extra water is added in case of crops in order to prevent burning of crop. It’s composed of Heating Tank, Condenser, Separator, Furnace & Steam Pipe these components are fundamental requirement of a distillation system.

2. Cultivation Procedure Saplings are sown in field by end of January after appropriately preparing the field (Levelling & Ploughing) followed by which water is continuously supplied to field in order to ensure good growth. The micro & macro nutrients are provided via fertilizers and manure as and when required to ensure a disease free plentiful yield. The Vetiver is an annual crop thus crops become ready for harvesting by beginning of December. 3. Harvesting Procedure Vetiver Oil is obtained from roots thus unrooting needs to performed once crop are prepared but as shoot of Vetiver is relatively bulky cutting of shoot is performed earlier followed by careful unrooting. Both cutting and unrooting can be performed manually or by machine. In case of machines human pulled harvesters for vetiver can be used but it’s advisable to avoid any machinery while heavy machinery cannot be used as required part of crop is root which might be damaged due to machine weight. The unrooting on the other hand can be performed by JCB’s, this method is advisable as Vetiver has fibrous type roots which are likely to be damaged in manual unrooting. The removed roots are cleaned followed by removal stock and supplied to Field Distillation Unit for extraction of oil. 4. Detailed Plant Procedure The roots obtained from field or one purchased from other farmers is washed in a large washing tank followed by soaking of roots in same tank for a day in order to allow the roots to swell in order to allow coagulation of vetiver root oil for easy and efficient extraction.

The Vetiver Roots are boiled with water in heating tank and are boiled for 60 to 70 hrs, during this period the steam generated carries along with it Vetiver Root Oil. This steam is transferred to condenser via steam pipe, as condenser is circulated with cooling water continuously, thus steam transferred to condenser undergoes condensation completing distillation process. The contents (Water + Vetiver Root Oil) obtained from condenser are supplied to separator which has an outlet at centre & a tap at bottom. The liquid is allowed to settle down and as oil and water are immiscible, water settles in-between low & high density oil, and is drained by centre outlet and supplied back to heating tank; entire process is repeated for enrichment purpose. The enrichment process continues for 60 to 70 hrs, after which high density vetiver root oil is initially obtained by pouring its content into a storage tank, once high density oil stop flowing into storage tank tap is closed and then reopened after replacing storage tank. The contents of both storage tanks are then packaged into Plastic Containers and marked appropriately with labels for sale.

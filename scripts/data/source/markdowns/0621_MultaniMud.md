MULTANI MUD MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Fuller's earth is a clay-like material made largely of aluminium magnesium silicate. It gets its name from the fact that it's used to clean dirt and grease off of wool. It was applied to the wool by a worker at a wool refinery known as a "fuller." Multani mitti, or "mud from Multan," is another name for it, and it originates from the Pakistan's city's history of mineral-rich clay. Fuller's earth may be used in skin care products including facial clays and masks that are claimed to reduce wrinkles and acne. It's also used in cosmetics to bind other substances, prevent other powders from caking together, give mild exfoliation, and stabilise products. Fuller's earth is recognised for its capacity to absorb oil and other impurities, making it a good skin cleanser for those who have oily skin or blocked pores. It's also supposed to soften the face and enhance skin tone and appearance. Fuller's earth is also said to have a skin-lightening effect, making it a common component in treatments aimed at reducing the appearance of black spots. There is no scientific evidence to support this assertion. Fuller's earth is a safe and reasonably affordable technique to cleanse and enhance the look of your skin, particularly if you have oily skin. It might also assist with acne and greasy hair. It's sold commercially both online and in stores, either as a powder or already incorporated into skin and hair products. Making your own clay or face masks with fuller's earth might be a good alternative to masks that contain harsh chemicals and synthetic components.

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL Multani mitti uses can be segmented to various applications like in pharmaceutical companies for medicinal purpose, skin care and beauty industry for facial and spas, handicraft sector for decorative items etc. The Multani mitti market is as energising and useful as the substance itself. It has a strong rural demand as well as a well-functioning urban demand. Multani mitti is classified as a sedimentary clay and is mostly constituted of the qualities silica, iron oxide, lime, magnesia, and water in extremely varied amounts. Olive, green, white, brown, yellow, blue, and more colours are available. The global market for Fuller's Earth and Allied Clays is expected to expand by 3.7 million tonnes, with a compounded annual growth rate of 2.9 percent. One of the sectors studied and examined in this research is bentonite, which has a growth potential of over 3.9 percent. Because of the changing forces that underpin this expansion, it's vital for enterprises in this sector to stay on top of the market's pulse. Poised to reach over 3 Million Tons by the year 2025, Bentonite will bring in healthy gains adding significant momentum to global growth. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT Basic raw material are as follows:  Water  Multani mitti rocks  Packing material

MANUFACTURING PROCESS Because of the increasing awareness of organic and natural skincare and beauty, people nowa days are shifting from chemically infused beauty products to natural remedies like multani mitti. Hence, the production of multani mitti occurs to be simply procurring it natural possible way.  Procurement of the raw material: This caly is widely obtained from the Multan region and Barmer part of Rajasthan, readily available with the sellers in the market.  Grinding Process: The Pure product is sourced and then put into grinnding process where it gets grind into finely coarsed powder.  Filtering the finished product: The next step involves filtering the grinded powder to remove the impurites. As largely the product is used to make facial paste and medicinal pupose, hence it is important to remove stone or hard substances from the powder for final packaging.  Packaging: Finally the filtered powder is packaged and stored for market distribution. For eminder it is important to pack the product in dry and damp free packaging such that the rawness and purety of the product remains intact wothout getting spoiled or damped. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500-2000 square feet. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs.20000.00 per month.

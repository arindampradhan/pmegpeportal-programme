MEDICINAL TABLETS MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Oral drug delivery is the most convenient, high patient compliance, cost-effective, and safe route of administration to treat various diseases. They come as solid tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, lozenges to be swallowed whole or sucked on, or as drinkable liquids such as drops, syrups, or solutions. In most cases, the ingredients in oral medication don't enter the bloodstream until they reach the stomach or bowel. A tablet is a pharmaceutical oral dosage form (oral solid dosage, or OSD) or solid unit dosage form. Tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medicament or medicaments with suitable excipients. It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. Tablets are prepared either by moulding or by compression. The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tableting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours

to enhance taste, and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever colour their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colours to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter. The compressed tablet is the most popular dosage form in use today. About two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered sublingually, buccally, rectally, or intravaginally. The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as syrups, elixirs, suspensions, and emulsions. 2 PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Tablets are chemicals or compounds used to cure, halt, or prevent disease; ease symptoms; or help in the diagnosis of illnesses. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process is as follows- Raw material procurement Making Process Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in; a dust- free, moisture-free, neat, and clean environment. Quality control of tablet raw materials (APIs and excipients) is one of the main tasks of the quality control unit in any drug manufacturing industry. Raw materials must undergo the necessary tests. It is often sufficient if identification testing is conducted on the individual packages/containers and content and purity determination in mixed samples. Every manufacturer has the opportunity to carry out further testing if they deem it necessary for guaranteeing a smooth-running production process or a very high-quality product.

Starting materials are released only after their quality is established or judged as satisfactory. Raw materials that fail the quality control test are rejected and returned to the supplier. Any risks that may emanate from starting materials of inappropriate quality must be avoided to prevent product failure and to ensure a consistent level of quality, as well as safety in consumer and industrial products. Tablets Making Process 1. Dispensing: After receiving raw material it will be procured in the RM store. At dispensing, booth raw material sampling is done. Each ingredient in the tablet formula is weighed and accurately dispensed as per dose. This is one of the critical steps in any type of formulation process and should be done under technical supervision. After sampling it will be sent to under testing. After testing raw material is stored in an approved area. After dispensing the material is then kept in a pass bag for further processing. After dispensing material is collected through a pass box. Here material will be cross-checked. According to MFR, it is then processed step by step. Shifting, Mixing, Granulation, Drying, Lubrication, etc is then performed step by step. Formulation ingredients must be in finely divided form, otherwise, size reduction should be carried out for better flow property and easy mixing. 2. Powder blending: Powders are mixed using a suitable blender to obtain a uniform and homogeneous powder mix. The drug substance and excipients are mixed in geometric dilution. 3. Granulation: Here small powder particles are gathered together into layers, and permanent aggregates to render them into free-flowing states. 4. Drying and dry screening: Screened wet granules need to be dried for a particular period in a tray dry or fluid bed dryer at a controlled temperature not exceeding 550C. Dried granules are screened through the appropriate mesh screen. Here lubrication is done. Lubricated tablet powder is stored separately and sent for sampling. 5. Tablet compression: Quality passed lubricated granules are used for compression. Before tablet compression line check will be done. The machine is properly cleaned or not is checked. For compression lubricated granules are fed into the hopper, according to MFR parameters tablets are compressed. This step involves the compression of granules into flat or convex, round, oblong, or unique shaped, scored, or unscored tablets; engraved with an identifying symbol and/ or code number using a tablet press. Along with this process, yield is recorded on BMR. 6. Coating: Tablets and granules are coated if there is a need to mask the unpleasant taste/odor of some drug substance or to increase the aesthetic appeal of uncoated tablets as well as to modify the release or control the release of drug substances from tablets. This is achieved by enclosing or covering the core tablet or granules with coating solutions. Color solution is made first before coating tablets. After coating, the sample is sent to QC for testing. 7. Packing: First primary packing is done. Blister or Alu alu machine is used for tablet striping and packing. Hydrogen flushing is done while tablet striping. PVC and aluminum foil is used for tablet packing. After

QC, the tablet is then sent for secondary packing; carton packing. After mass packing, again final QC is done and the tablet is ready to dispatch. Testing  Quality Control 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2,500-3,000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs. 40,000 per month. Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx. 1,500 Sqft. Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 700 Sqft. Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is

Market Opportunities Urbanization has changed the lifestyles of not only urbanites but even of semi- urban and rural areas. This along with increase in the purchasing power of people has fuelled demand for many fast-food or instant food items and vermicelli is one such product. With the addition of groundnut or soybean or tapioca flour, it also becomes a nutritive product and thus even health conscious people prefer it. Vermicelli has, thus, become a very popular instant food variety since last few years and its demand is steadily growing. There are some established brands like Maggi and Fryums but the market is very large and growing. A small scale unit can compete with these brands in the local market on the price front because of low overheads, less transportation costs and reasonable advertisement budget. Proper and adequate placement of product and thrust on publicity basically at the point of sales would also be crucial. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Applications Vermicelli is an extruded instant food product basically made from wheat flour. Other flours like groundnut, soybean or tapioca are also mixed with wheat flour to make it more nutritive. They are easily affordable, tasty and easy to make. This product can be made in many states of the country Availability of knowhow and compliances DFRL, Mysore,, has successfully developed the technical know-how. BIS has specified quality parameters in 1485:1976. Compliances under the PFA Act are mandatory. Capacity of the Project Rated production capacity of 80 tonnes per year with 300 working days and 8 hours working every day. 2

Manufacturing process It is very well standardised and simple. Wheat and other flours in small quantity are mixed with around 25% to 30% of water in a mixer for about half an hour and dough is prepared. This dough is passed through extruder and long rods of vermicelli come out from the extruder which are cut into the desired length and then placed in the tray drier for drying. Drying temperature is around 55-65 degree C and time required is 4Â½ to 5 hours. Dried pieces are weighed and packed in attractively printed polythene bags. The weight and process loss is around 10%. The process flow chart is as under: Mixing of Ingredients Dough Preparation Extrusion Drying and Packing FSSAI LICENSE: FSSAI License is issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of Family Health & Welfare, Government of India. Application to commence a food business must be made to the FSSAI in the prescribed format. Based on the application and supporting documents, FSSAI will accord approval. The Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations 2011 introduced to improve the hygiene and quality of food has brought about tremendous changes in the food industry. As per the Act, no person shall commence or carry on any food business except under a FSSAI license or FSSAI registration.

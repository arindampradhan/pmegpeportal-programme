INDUSTRY OUTLOOK & TRENDS: Market for Ladies Suit has witnessed a continuous growth in last two decades. The growth is result of increasing women literacy, number of working women, impact of urbanization in semi urban & rural areas and awareness of women’s rights. The ladies suits are not just formal but are also comfortable and go well in offices, educational institutions and celebrations / events. Designer suits have become a rage with people having high disposable income. The demand follows income and education charts. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: An increasing number of women now prefer to work and therefore need formal clothing. Ladies suit offers good look, physical comfort and perfect functionality in office as well as industrial duties. It can also be worn on all outdoor occasions. Therefore the market for this product is simply huge. The price of a ladies suit varies from low of Rss500 to high of Rs10,000 depending on type of material, design, style, fitting and accessories etc. There are several branded and unbranded (local labels) products in the market. Although the competition is severe, there is room for every player to find his niche offering the right product and price. There is also some market for partly stitched ladies suits and unstitched dress material. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The main raw material is fabric. Variety of cotton and synthetic fabric is available in all major cities. Accessories like buttons, laces, zippers, patches, danglers, piping etc are also easily available with traders dealing in tailoring materials or dress materials. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The fabric purchased in roll form is spread in layers on the cutting table. Patterns of various parts of the garmentmade out of card board or plywood or metal are laid on the fabric in such a way that wastage of fabric is minimized. Several layers of fabric are then cut through vertical motorized blade. Garments are stitched in assembly line manner wherein each machine operator completes only a part of the product. The stitching starts on the 1st machine and gets completed at the last stage where the product is inspected for quality defects if any. Garments are then cleaned of loose yarn or dirt and packed in plastic bags as per customer requirements.

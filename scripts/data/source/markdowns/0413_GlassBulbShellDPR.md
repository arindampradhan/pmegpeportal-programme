GLASS BULB SHELL MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The common incandescent light bulb consists of several parts, some of which you can see, and a few you can't. Thin outer glass shell of the bulb is called the bulb shell/globe. The glass ensures maximum light efficiency and provides strong support for the other parts of the bulb. It contains the filament which gives off light, a stem, which holds the filament, and a metal base that screws into a socket, such as in a lamp or ceiling fixture. The parts function together as one of the most successful inventions of all time. Uses & Market Potential: The glass ensures maximum light efficiency and provides strong support for the other parts of the bulb. It contains the filament which gives off light, a stem, which holds the filament, and a metal base that screws into a socket, such as in a lamp or ceiling fixture. The global glassware industry is positively impacted by a recent change in buying behaviour of consumers who are increasingly favouring premium homeware products. Moreover, the availability of trendy glassware products is favouring the overall industry growth. A wide variety of glass shells for consumers, industrial and automobile lamps are produced. Increasing disposable income of consumers from developing nations such as China and India is resulting in strong demand for luxury and premium glassware products. The soda lime glass segment expected to grow at the fastest rate of 12.4% CAGR during the upcoming years.

Product: GLASS BULB SHELL Raw Material: 1. Soda Lime Silica Glass (Soda Ash 33%, Silica Sand 66% and chemicals 1%) produced at around 1450 degree Celsius 2. Lead Glass (Soft Glass) in which around 24% Lead (Pb) is mixed as a raw material. Most of the products are manufactured using Soda Lime Glass Manufacturing Process: Fig. 1 – Process Flowchart Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small scale factory setup is 2000-3000 Sq. ft. approximate.

PATCHWORK FABRICS UNIT Introduction: Patchwork is a print trend rather than a fabric trend. In the distinctive way the printed materials are placed in the patchwork design gives the outfit a distinct personality. Print-on-print and patchwork are not the same thing. There isn't much of a distinction between patchwork and print-on-print, as both provide the wearer with a unique experience. Though there isn't much of a distinction between patchwork and print-on-print, both provide the user with a variety of colours and prints to choose from. Patchwork prints, on the other hand, are intelligently and imaginatively made as one piece by stitching multiple pieces of print cloth together, unlike layered prints. It may appear to be mismatched bits of fabric at first glance, but putting together different pieces of cloth and turning them into a beautiful outfit that is designed to look that way takes a lot of thinking. Patchwork is a craft that promotes recycling and, as a result, has several environmental advantages. There is no need to produce these textiles from raw materials because existing fibres and fabrics may be reused (such as cotton, wool, and synthetic fibres). This reduces the amount of energy consumed and pollutants produced in production operations like as dying, washing, and scouring.

Uses & Market Potential: Patchwork, often known as "pieced work," is a type of needlework in which pieces of cloth are sewn together to make a bigger design. The bigger design is often made up of recurring patterns made up of various fabric forms (which can be different colours). These basic geometric shapes have been carefully measured and cut, making them simple to piece together. Patchwork is most often used to make quilts, but it can also be used to make rugs, bags, wall-hangings, warm jackets, cushion covers, skirts, waistcoats and other items of clothing. Patchwork patterns were used with square patterned wall tiles by brands like D&G, creating a gypsy atmosphere, and patchwork designs have been a popular motif for numerous design companies since then. Patchwork with tribal patterns and geometrical motifs is very popular. Metallic studs, sheer ruffles, mesh, embroidery, pleats, and leather are just a few of the embellishments that may be used to create a stunning look. The global decorated apparel market size was valued at USD 26.75 billion in 2018 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 10.91% over the forecast period of 2019 to 2025. Increasing demand for embroidery, screen printing, sublimation, and heat transfer works on apparel is driving the growth of the market. With the growing popularity of personalised t-shirts and tops, demand for clothing printing is rising, resulting in market expansion. Furthermore, market growth will be fuelled by product and technical advancements, particularly in the women's apparel sector. Over the projected period, the rising trend of patchwork and vintage logo designs is likely to enhance product demand. Product: PATCHWORK FABRIC Raw Material: 1. Cotton Fabric: Pieces of cotton fabric is the basic material used for making the applique patchwork. 2. Scissor: Scissor is used for cutting extra fabric and thread. 3. Thread: Thread is used for stitching the pieces of fabric together. 4. Needle: Needle is used for sewing the fabric.

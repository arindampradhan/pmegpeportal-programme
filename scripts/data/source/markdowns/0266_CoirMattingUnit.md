PROJECT PROFILE FOR SEMI AUTOMATIC COIR MATTING UNIT INTRODUCTION The main problem of weaving on hand loom is the high force needed to operate the pedal for lifting the shed and the force to beat the slay. Usually healthy male workers are engaged for weaving. In power loom, both this operation is done by motor but the high cost of the loom is restricting the user to purchase the power loom. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE In the semi-automatic loom, beating, shedding and winding are carried by motor and the picking is done manually and high force is not needed to operate the pedal for lifting the shed and the force to beat the slay. The quality of the mating woven in this loom is good. The picks also can be changed depending on thickness of weft yarn. The cost is less compared to power loom. BASIS AND PRESUMTIONS The Project Profile is based on 8 working hours in a day and 25 days in a month and the Break Even efficiency has been calculated on 70%, 80%, 90%, 90% and 100% capacity utilization. The rate of interest both for fixed asset and working capital have been taken as 11.5% p.a. 1

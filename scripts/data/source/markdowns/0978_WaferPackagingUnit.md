Packaging unit Market Analysis The Indian packaging industry itself is growing at 14-15% annually.  This growth rate is expected to double in the next two years. According to the Indian Packaging Institute, Indian Packaging industry  is USD 14 billion and growing at more than 15% p.a. These figures indicate towards a change in the industrial and consumer set up. The growth in the packaging industry in India is mainly driven by the food and the pharmaceutical packaging sectors. The large and growing Indian middle class, along with the growth in organized retailing in the country are fueling growth in the packaging industry. Another factor, which has provided substantial stimulus to the packaging machinery industry is the rapid growth of exports, which requires superior packaging standards for the international market. With this the need for adopting better packaging methods, materials and machinery to ensure quality has become very important for Indian businesses. The Indian packaging industry is dominated by plastic flexible packaging. The traditional rigid packaging users have also been seen to shift to flexible packaging in recent times. According to industry sources, the main reasons for this is that flexible packages are found aesthetically attractive, cost-effective and sturdy. Consumer preference for the use of convenient packaging and packaged products in affordable quantities in laminates is also one of the main reasons that have contributed to the growth of flexible packaging in India. The food-processing sector is the largest user of flexible packaging, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total demand. The flexible packaging segment is estimated to be growing at over 35 percent annually. Major players in the flexible packaging sector are Paper Products Ltd. and Flex Industries. Manufacturing Process The first step in pouch packaging is ordering or creating your pouches. Depending on what you’re packing and what machine you’re using, you may want to use anything from small, 2-inch pouches up to large, 250mm pouches.

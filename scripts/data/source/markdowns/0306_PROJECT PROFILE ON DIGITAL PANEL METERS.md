# 0306 Project Profile On Digital Panel Meters

## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON DIGITAL PANEL METERS Introduction : Digital panel meter is basically a voltage measuring device. It consists of analog switches, integrator, comparator, control circuitry with display unit. With the modern technique of production in the field of chemical refineries and fertilizers, it is expected that yearly requirement is high. The requirement of the country for this item at present is being met through imports. It has a very good export market. Raw materials required for the production of Digital Panel Meters are Hole Printed circuit baords, chips, electrolytic capacitors, poly carbonate capacitors, metal film resistors, leakage & switching transistors, zenor diodes, transformers etc. Process of Manufacture: Various electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, chips and transistors are soldered on printed, circuit board. Sub assemblies of power supply, switching circuit, integrator, comparator circuit and counter are assembled and tested for resolution, accuracy, drift, operational amplifier characteristics, input impedance, common mode rejection etc. The output is checked ona jig fitted with nixie tubes. The standard voltage are fed to the input circuit and it is again calibrated and tested. 1 Name of the Product : DIGITAL PANEL METERS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.ft Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 200,000.00 Digital voltage standard, drilling machine, shearing machine, Bendig machine, Instrument lathe painting unit, Oscilloscope, Signal generator,Multimeter, LCR Bridge, PCB Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 200,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 165,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 365,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in 000) Sr. No. Particulars Capacity in No./Q.

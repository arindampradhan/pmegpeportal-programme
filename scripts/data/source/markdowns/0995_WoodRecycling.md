WOOD RECYLING Introduction: Wood recycling or Timber recycling is the process of turning waste wood into usable products. Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source. Recycling timber is environment friendly form of timber production and is very common in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where supplies of old wooden structures are plentiful. Timber can be chipped down into wood chips which can be used to power homes or power plants. In the landfill wood is a wasted resource. Wood can be reused as building material, recycled into mulch for landscaping or pulp for paper production and used beneficially as a fuel. Reusing and recycling wood reduces the need to cut down trees. Uses & Market Potential: Wood can be reused as building material, recycled into mulch for landscaping or pulp for paper production and used beneficially as a fuel. Reusing and recycling wood reduces the need to cut down trees. In terms of application, the global wood recycling market has been segmented into wood panels, energy generation, and others which include landscaping products, animal bedding, furniture, pulp, coal making, etc. Increasing demand for plywood globally, is

increasing the overall demand for recycled wood into wood panel manufacturing. Recyclable wood can come from numerous sources like construction waste, industrial waste, pallets, junk furniture, tree trimming, etc. More common woods are Oak, Cedar, Maple, Cherry, etc. These woods are ideal for manufacturing furniture and pallets. Pallet recycling is big business for many companies. Almost every truck freighted item in this country is shipped on a pallet; therefore the market for used pallets and pallet disposal is huge. Raw material: Raw material that is used is waste Wood (Small Blocks, Chips, Saw Dust), and other consumables (Adhesives, Nails, etc.) Average rate per (Kg) waste wood is Rs 2.5 to 5 Machinery Requirements: Following machinery are required for automatic wood recycling Unit: 1. Waste Separator 2. Shredder 3. Conveyor Belt 4. Grinder 5. Hopper 6. Compression Molding machine 7. Other equipments and hand tools Average machine cost for wood recycling unit will be Rs 30 Lac (Approx) Manufacturing Process: Wood recycling is the process by which clean waste wood, containing no contaminants or hazardous materials such as glue, lead paint, asbestos or creosote, are ground into chips and used to make new products. Wood that is recycled is diverted from landfills, reducing the number of new landfill sites that must be created. The process is straightforward. Load waste wood containing rock, soil or metal into the hopper allowing it to be moved by conveyor into the trommel screen where small pieces drop through and large pieces drop into a water bath. Separate wood floating in the water bath using an upper conveyor belt partially positioned below the surface of the water. Transport the floating

wood by conveyor to the front of the classifier. Move, by means of a lower conveyor, the heavier waterlogged wood and rock from the bottom of the wood bath and transport it to the rear of the classifier for disposal. Pick up the wood from the front of the classifier using a front end loader. Expose the wood to industrial magnets to separate any metal from the mix. Move the material to the tub grinder, horizontal grinder or wood chipper. Grind the wood into chips to be sold for use in particle board, chipboard, pulp and paper products, animal bedding, mulch, biomass fuel and compost. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

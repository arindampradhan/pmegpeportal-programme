BULB HOLDER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A bulb holder, light socket, lamp socket or bulb socket is a device which mechanically supports and provides electrical connections for a compatible electric bulb or lamp. Sockets allow bulbs to be safely and conveniently replaced. The construction of a bulb holder socket defines and limits its intended use. Ceramic insulation can withstand considerably higher operating temperature than bakelite or other plastics. The electrical components and wires must be designed to carry the intended current plus a safety factor. The contact surface area, conductivity and thickness of the metal, maximum operating temperature and connection methods must all be considered in the design of a bulb holder. Bulb holder failures are usually caused by mechanical abuse or by overheating. A socket with a built-in switch is far more likely to fail in normal use as the switch parts wear out. Insulation failures are usually caused by impacts or by difficulty inserting or removing a bulb. Bulb holders used outdoors or in damp areas often suffer from corrosion which can cause the bulb to "stick" in the socket and attempts to change a bulb can result in breakage of either the lamp or the bulb holder.

Uses & Market Potential: A bulb holder is the device used to hold a light bulb or lamp. Most light fittings or luminaires have a bulb holder. For wall and ceiling lights with a fixed bulb holder, it's important that the lamp holder is compatible with the type of bulb you want to use. Bulb holders can be used at household, stores, school, restaurant, hotel and factory etc. The global bulb market reached a value of US$ 5.4 Billion in 2018. The market is further projected to reach a value of US$ 9.5 Billion by 2024, expanding at a CAGR of 9.4% during the year 2019-2024. Electricity has become an irreplaceable part of our day-to-day lives. The importance of electricity in our lives cannot be refuted. While electricity is a broad term, there are many nuances involved in creating, supplying, and using it. However, there are many intricate components that play an important role in electricity supply and use; Bulb holder is one of them. The demand of different type’s bulb is increased because of urbanization. In India under Ujala yojana the LED light bulbs will be given at subsidized prices. The prices was slashed down by 60% and the reduced price is 40% less than the market price. The demand of bulbs are increased hence the demand of bulb holder. Product: Bulb Holder Raw Material: Basic raw material are Plastic, Metal sheet and other parts (Brass terminals, screws, springs, etc.)

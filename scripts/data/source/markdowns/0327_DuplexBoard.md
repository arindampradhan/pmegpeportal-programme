DUPLEX BOARD MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Duplex Board is a kind of paperboard or cardboard, also named greyboard, due to its double side grey color. It consists of two layers, or plies, so people call it duplex board. The exterior one side of the board often is coated with a bright white appearance to give it a glossy sheen. Coated duplex board one side with a glossy coated surface suit for superior printability. The advantage of the duplex board is rigid, durable, straight. In Box Packaging Solution team, usually, we use it to make luxury rigid gift boxes, like rigid shoe boxes, garment boxes, and toys packing. Because of the outstanding paper stiffness, which is strong support for the box die- cutting process, and laminating hot stamping results. Also, it could be used for making containers to pack wine and liquor packaging. The uncoated duplex board always be wrapped with art paper and specialty paper to build rigid boxes with fantastic artwork printing.

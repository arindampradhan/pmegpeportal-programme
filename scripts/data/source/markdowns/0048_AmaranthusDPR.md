AMARANTHUS PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Amaranth in Hindi is known as Rajgira. Simply put, Rajgira means raj (royal) & gira (grain). As a matter of fact, amaranth grain meaning in Gujarati is also Rajgira. Moreover, amaranth grain in India is also known as 'Ramdana', meaning God’s own grain. Amaranthus is a genus (family Amaranthaceae) consisting of more than 50 species and is a pseudocereal that was domesticated in America over 4000 years ago by the Aztecs and Mayas. The importance of amaranth has resurged in the last years due to agricultural features, since it is a fast-growing cultivar with tolerance to drought conditions, can grow in poor soils, and has important nutritional properties. Moreover, it has minerals, such as calcium, sodium, iron, magnesium, and vitamin E. Polyphenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which have been characterized in amaranth grains, which makes it an excellent source of bioactive compounds. Typically, amaranth grain is not eaten raw and suffers a variety of processing methods in order to achieve desired flavor, color, texture, and, sometimes, nutritional and nutraceutical properties. Uses & Market Potential: Amaranth seed has a high protein content, which helps muscles heal faster after they've worked out. Recent developments, such as busy and urban lifestyles, the acceptance of on-the-go meals, and rising health consciousness among the working population, are expected to fuel demand for low-cost protein sustenance over the forecast period. Amaranth oil also has anti-inflammatory effects, which may help you avoid allergic

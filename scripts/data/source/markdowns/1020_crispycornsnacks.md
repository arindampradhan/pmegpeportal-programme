CRISPY CORN SNACKS MAKING UNIT Introduction: Extruded snacks are a type of snack prepared through the extrusion process, in which raw materials such as starch-rich materials such as corn, maize, wheat, rice, potato flour, and so on are ground to the correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour, and then transformed into hot melt fluids or dry mixes. This mixture is passed through a pre- conditioner, where other ingredients, such as liquid sugar, fats, dyes, meats, or water, are added, depending on the target product. To begin the cooking process, steam is pumped, and the preconditioned mix (extrude) is then passed through an extruder, where it is expanded or puffed. Extrusion cooking is the most recent and advanced technology to produce ready-to- eat snacks. Extrusion cooking necessitates a higher temperature and a shorter cooking time. Extrusion cooking is a common processing method in the food industry because it is a cost- effective manufacturing method. Extrusion cooking produces products with low density, high expansion, and a distinctive texture by combining high temperature, high pressure, and high force. Extrusion allows you to change the functional and rheological properties of food ingredients in addition to the normal advantages of heat production.

Uses & Market Potential: Snacks give energy during the day or when you exercise. A balanced snack in between meals can help to feel fuller and avoid overeating at mealtime. Snacks are small portions of food consumed between meals. RTE Snacks are available in a number of formats, extruded food, including canned snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items prepared at home with fresh ingredients. The Indian extruded snacks market is expanding rapidly and is expected to grow at a high CAGR through 2021, owing to changing consumer tastes and preferences, rising demand for different snack flavors, increasing acceptance of western snacks in the country's traditional diet, rising disposable income, and the availability of extruded snacks at low prices. Furthermore, major companies such as Pepsi Co, ITC, and others are constantly introducing new products and investing heavily in marketing and advertising, with extruded snack advertisements visible even in remote areas of the region. Because of the presence of states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, where extruded snack consumption is considered to be the highest in India, increasing purchasing power, and shifting customer taste preferences, the West India region currently accounts for the largest share of the extruded snacks market in India. Due to high population density, a growing middle-class population, a significant proportion of youth and working-age people, and other factors. In India's extruded snack industry, the North is projected to have the second-largest market share. Product: Crispy corn snacks

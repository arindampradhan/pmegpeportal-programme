BANANA PAPER MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Banana, fruit of the genus Musa, of the family Musaceae, one of the most important fruit crops of the world. The banana is grown in the tropics, and, though it is most widely consumed in this region, it is valued worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value, and availability throughout the year. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. Banana may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Banana plants thrive naturally on deep, loose, well-drained soils in humid tropical climates, and they are grown successfully under irrigation in such semiarid regions as southern Jamaica. Suckers and divisions of the rhizome are used as planting material; the first crop ripens within 10 to 15 months, and thereafter fruit production is more or less continuous. Banana paper is a type of paper created from banana plant bark or banana peel fibres. Banana paper has a lower density, higher stiffness, higher disposability, higher renewability, and higher tensile strength compared to traditional paper. These qualities are due to the cellular composition of banana fibre, which consists of cellulose, hemi cellulose, and lignin. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  Banana Paper helps prevent excessive pollution of the eco-system's rivers and forests.  Banana paper is used in lights, artwork, sketching and can be turned into beautiful journals and Note books well.  The Banana paper is used screen print and ink jet friendly and available from 30 to 380 GSM. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS

This process can be broken down into the following steps:  Raw material procurement  Production Process Raw Material Procurement: Procurement is the connection process of purchasing and arranging in bound movement of all items, supplies, materials, parts, finished inventory and general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses. Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Banana Paper:  Collecting of Banana stem: The collection of banana stem take place before proceed to cutting operation.  Cutting of materials: The banana stem is collecting and cutting down in a small part so that proper semi liquid product can be made.  Pulping of stem: The process carried to remove fibre present in the process before going to remove moisture from it.  Beating process for paper: The removal of water from semi liquid product done by pressing of the residue to remove water content.  Screening of residue: The semi liquid product can be placed over this plate and solidification take place.  Removal of residual moisture: The residual moisture can be removed by putting plate in a vertical position so that water totally removed.  Packaging of paper: Banana paper are proceeded for packaging process according to standards customer requirement. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 800-1000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of

the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs. 15,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx. 450 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 300 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 150 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project 3.2 Plant & Machinery Machines- Stem Cutter: The stem cutter is used to cut the large portion of Banana stem into small parts.  Pulp bater: The pulp machine is used to convert the solid input product of banana tree into the semi liquid removing fibre from it.

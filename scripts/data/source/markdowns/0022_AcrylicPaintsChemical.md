ACRYLIC PAINTS Introduction: In the 1940s after the Second World War, the paint manufacturing industry moved away from the old tried and true methods of making linseed oil paint and began heavily promoting chemical, petroleum and solvent based paints. With the awareness of danger of petroleum products in the environment, we are entering a new period for the painting industry. Major difference in modern paint is the change in the binder form the used natural boiled linseed oil to alkyd oil, which is generally derived from Soybean and Safflower oil. Use of synthetic resins, such as acrylics and epoxies, has become prevalent in paint manufacture in the last 30 years. Acrylic resin emulsions in latex paints with water thinner have also become common. Uses & Market Potential: Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion and plasticizers, silicon oils, defoamers, stabilizers, metal soaps. Acrylic paints are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry. Acrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the

paint surface by using acrylic mediums. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials. Acrylic paints have good adhesion on difficult substrates. This pure acrylic emulsion paint helps prevent adhesion related failures after a long period of time; blistering, peeling and cracking, and flaking. Also paint discoloration is an undesirable change in the colour of exterior paint. Pure acrylic emulsions ensure to paint a very constant and durable colour for long periods of time. The resistance to chalking and fading of the acrylic paints is much better than any other paint particularly in sunny exposure. Due to above said qualities acrylic paints especially exterior paints are preferably used in place of oil based paints.

Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. DM Water 2. Wetting Agent 3. HEC 4. Pine Oil 5. Titanium Dioxide 6. China Clay 7. Calcite 8. Acrylic Emulsion 9. Thickener 10. Defoamer 11. Other Preservatives and emulsifiers Manufacturing Process: Solution of hydroxy ethyl cellulose (HEC) is made with the help of water and ammonia. All the pigments and extenders are mixed with the small quantity of water and weighting agents with the help of high speed stirrer having the rpm of 1500. The prepared mill base is passed through the sand mill with the flow rate of 3 – 4 litrs per minutes. For light colour mill based is passed once through the sand mill and for dark colour it is passed through twice or thrice depending upon the hardness of pigment. The grinded material is mixed with the remaining water and emulsion at a low rpm with the high speed stirrer. Thickener, coaleasing agents, defoamer, buffer solution are added under slow speed to get the right consistency. Various water based stainers are added to the prepared paint to get the required shade of paint. After preparation and thorough checking of quality parameters the acrylic paint is packed to different small containers. Now it is ready for dispatch at various places.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1200Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 3 Lac Rs.(Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

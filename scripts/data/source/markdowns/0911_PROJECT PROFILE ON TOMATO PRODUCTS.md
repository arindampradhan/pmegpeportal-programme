"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" Project Profile on Tomato Products Introduction : Tomato, though botanically a fruit for the purpose of trade, is generally considered a vegetable because of the way in which it is consumed. Tomatoes are widely grown in all parts of the world. However, the yield per hectare is the highest (245 tonnes/hect.) in Netherlands. The world average yield of tomato is 23 tones per hectare. Indian average yield of tomato is 9.6 tones per hectare. Tomato products such as puree, juice, ketchup are commonly used commodities in households, hotels are restaurants. These items are used to enhance the taste of different food products. Tomato puree is used as a substitute of fresh tomato in cooking. Ketch up is a sweeter and diluted version of puree (Pulp).

Tomato juice- Fully ripe will developed colour tomatoes are washed, trimmed, steamed, crushed in a crusher or cut into pieces with knives. The crushed pieces are heated in the steam jacketted kettle till they become quite soften. The heated tomatoes are passed through the pulping machien using a fine mesh sieve to separate juice from seeds and the skin. The sugar and salt @ 1% is added and heated to 85-90 C. The hot juice is then filled in bottles, sealted immediately and processed sterlised in boiling water for about 30 minutes and cooled. Tomato Puree- The juice obtained as above is concentrated under cacuum to about 9% to 12% total solids so as to get tomato puree.

Generally, concentration is doen three folkd. It is concentrated to 28% to 30% solids in which 12% are tomato solids. The final product could be preserved by addition of sodium benzoate @ 750 ppm. The tomato ketchup is filled hot into clean, dry bottles,crown corked and processed in boiling water for 30 minutes and cooled at room temperature 1 Name of the Product : Tomato Product such as Tomato puri,Ketchup,Juice 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.fmts150 On rent Rs. 3 6,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 6 50,000.00 Steam boiler 150kg/hr-1,Washing machine-1,S.

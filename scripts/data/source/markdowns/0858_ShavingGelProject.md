Manufacturing Process: Fig.1 – Flow Chart In personal care products manufacturing, formulation of raw material with fragrance plays an important role. The raw material for shaving gel is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the deionized water and aloe vera gel are mixed in required proportion in a tank. The tank is heated to a temperature of 80-85 ℃ by using steam jacketed kettle. The jacketed kettle, resembles a double boiler with one container placed inside another, is heated when steam is circulated through the outer container. Inside the interior kettle are blades that revolve to mix the oils as they are heated. After heating for 40-50 minutes the first group of ingredients has turned smooth. The steam is released from the outer container of the kettle, and the mixture is allowed to cool.

In the next step, the mixture is allowed to cool down to a temperature of 60℃. At this temperature glycerin, propylene glycol and sodium PCA is added. The mixture is stirred continuously for uniform composition. Agitators are used for stirring. Heating is used to maintain the temperature. The stirring is done for 30 minutes. After this, sodium laureth sulphate is added into the mixture in desired proportion and mixture is allowed to cool down.. SLS are the surface active agents lower the surface tension, penetrate and loosen surface deposits and emulsify or suspend the debris. In the next step, when the mixture temperature reaches to 45℃panthenol, lanonin and comfrey extract are added in desired proportion. Comfrey extract are used in wound healing, reduces itching. Fragrance is added in desired composition as per requirement. The mixture is allowed to cool down with continuously stirring. The mixture is allowed to settle down and to reach the room temperature conditions. In the next step, the mixture is transferred into homogenizer and carbomer is added in desired proportion. Continuous stirring is done to avoid any bubble formation into the solution. After 15-20 minutes of continuous stirring gel formation begins. The mixture is allowed to settle down into freezers for gel formation. The gel prepared in the previous step is check for desired specifications. After this, they are filled in the bottles using filling machine. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1800 - 2000Sqft.

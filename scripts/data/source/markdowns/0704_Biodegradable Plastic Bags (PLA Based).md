BIODEGRDABLE PLATSIC BAGS (PLA BASED) MANUFACTURING 1. INTRODUCTION The term “Biodegradable” refers to anything or substances that can be degraded by the natural forces and micro-organisms and Bio-degradable plastics refer to those plastics that can be decomposed by the micro-organisms and also natural factors such as rain, sunlight, etc. Hence these bags will not pose to be a threat to the environment. Plastic bags can be made “Oxo-biodegradable” by manufacturing theme from the normal polyethylene or the polypropylene and then incorporating an additive that can cause them to degrade and then biodegradation of the polymer by oxidation. Fig.: Biodegradable Plastic Bags and PLA pellets The global production capacity of the biodegradable plastic bags reached around 1.17 million tons in 2019. Polylactic Acid (PLA) based is probably the most well-known biodegradable plastic but besides that there are about 20 groups of biodegradable plastic polymers. Of these 20 known biodegradable plastic groups, only 3 types are produced commercially and those include (i) Starch blends (ii) PLA; and (iii) Polybutylene based polymers which includes Polybutyl Succinate (PBS) and Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT) which are both fossil fuel based.

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a potential and popular polymer material. It is also called “Polylactide” and can be produced by the fermentation of renewable sources such as Corn, Cassava, Potato, and Sugarcane. Other feedstock that have been researched and explored include Cellulosic Materials, Agricultural Byproducts, and even greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide and Methane. But that technology is still under development and agricultural by-products set to remain as the main feedstock for starch blends and PLA in the near future. PLA has excellent properties as compared to aliphatic polyesters such as high mechanical strength, high modulus, biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioabsorbability, transparency, and low toxicity. Because of its excellent properties, PLA has shown potential applications in different sectors such as agricultural films, biomedical devices, packaging, and automotive industries. Although PLA is a bio-degradable polymer, but its complete degradation may take several years. As of 2019, production capacity of PLA was approximately 290 thousand tons. The initial production of the biodegradable polymers started in the Europe, the US, and Japan but the production was soon shifted to different parts of Asia due to the low cost of the raw materials and the convenience of feedstock acquisition. Many companies have emerged in China, India, and Thailand that are financed by the local investors and also companies from the global north. 2. MARKET POTENTIAL The global was valued at USD 3.27 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 6.12 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 15.1 % from 2020 to 2025. The governments across the world are prohibiting the use of single use plastics and this coupled with the rising awareness among the people regarding the harm that the plastics are doing to the Earth are among the key trends that are fuelling this market. Non-compostable plastics are an issue across the globe now and the best way to deal with it is the manufacture and the use of biodegradable plastics. The market can be segmented on the basis of Material, End-Use, and Regional Outlook. On the basis of the Material, there can be the following types: Starch-based, PLA-based, Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT), Polybutylene Succinate (PBS), Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), and others. Among these types, the Starch-based bags are set to dominate the market. The segment is poised to expand at a revenue-based CAGR of 10.4%

during the same period in terms of revenue. The PLA-based plastics on the other hand are also another popular category and this is mainly due to the low-cost of the products. On the basis of End-Use the areas include: Packaging, Industrial sector, Agricultural sector, and others. Among them, the packaging sector dominates the market as Biodegradable plastics are used in both flexible and rigid packaging. Replacement of conventional plastics by these products in food packaging such as boxes, wraps, cups, and plates is gaining momentum, which is supporting the growth of the biodegradable plastic market. In the agricultural sector, the use of Biodegradable Mulch Film ensures conservation of water in the soil, suppresses weed growth, and soil temperature maintenance in order to facilitate faster crop development. As far the regional outlook is considered, the market can be divided into North-America, Europe, Asia-Pacific region, and the rest of the world. Among the above regions, the highest market share in the biodegradable plastics market is hold by Europe since 2019. In the Asia- Pacific region as well, the market is expected to emerge as the fastest growing market. 3. INDUSTRIAL SCENERIO The major names in the biodegradable plastics market are: BASF SE, Nature Works LLC, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Carbion, and Biome Technologies plc. On the global scale, the American company Nature Works leads the PLA sector, operating a manufacturing facility in Midwestern state of Nebraska with a production capacity of 150,000 tons. They use crops that grow within 50 miles of their US production capacity. Total Corbion PLA operates the world’s second largest PLA plant in Rayong, Thailand. The plant was opened in 2019, with an annual capacity of 75,000 tonnes, using non-Ithe company announced, the company announced its plan for a second PLA plant based in Grandpuits, France,with an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes. The remaining major PLA producers are mainly from China and most of the companies are small scale companies with a fairly small production capacity of 10, 000 – 50, 000 tons per year. Jiangsu Yunyoucheng operates the largest PLA plant in China, with an annual capacity of 50,000 tonnes. In India too, there is a high demand for bio-degradable plastics and our country has a huge amount of bio-mass required for their production. Quite a few manufacturing firms like

Envigreen, Ecolife, Plastobags, Earthsoul India and Truegreen have come up with different forms of bioplastics, which are already supplying these environment friendly forms of plastics in regional markets. Truegreen is a firm based out of Ahmedabad that started the manufacturing plant with a production capacity of 5000 MT per year. Ecolife is a firm based out of Chennai that manufactures Bio-plastics for industrial purposes. Bengaluru based firm Envigreen which is the latest startup to enter the Indian bioplastics market has a production capacity of upto 1000 Tons bioplastics per year. 4. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 4.1 PRODUCT USES The uses of the biodegradable plastics can be listed as follows: 1. The manufacturing of the compostable bags is the primary sector of application of the Biodegradable plastics. These bags can be used as grocery carrying, Food Storage, Garbage bags, 2. Packaging is another important sector of application of the biodegradable plastics and accounted for 59 % of the biodegradable plastics made in 2019. Flexible packaging requires almost 500, 000 tons of biodegradable plastics. 3. The second area is the agricultural and the horticultural sector that used 14 % of the biodegradable plastics manufactured in 2019. Agricultural mulching film is used to improve crop yield in many countries. 4. They are also used as consumer goods in different areas. 4.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The raw materials required for the production of PLA plastics are “Polylactic Acid or Polylactic Acid Blends”. These are available in the form of granules, in various grades, for the use by the plastic convertors. PLA is a polymer of Lactic Acid, which is a natural acid produced by the fermentation of sugars or starch with the help of micro-organisms. The PLA formed

from the starch or the sugar is incapable of being used as plastics and hence the raw PLA is compounded by mixing it with other substances or by co-polymerization or it is blended with other plastics to enhance its properties. Besides this, certain additives are also added to the PLA blends that include UV stabilizers, impact resistance modifiers, plasticizers, color pigments. 4.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The production process for PLA Plastic Blends can be written as follows: 1. A “polymer” becomes plastic only when they are correctly adapted to the specific application by compounding. Compounding means preparing for use, and describes the enhancing process that raw plastics go through, being blended with certain additives (e. g. fillers or other additives) to optimize their properties for the planned application. Such aids can be processing aids, UV stabilizers, impact resistance modifiers, plasticizers, color pigments, and many other things. Compounding can be done in a mixing vessel. Here the components that are added to the PLA blends are mixed together and homogenized. 2. The PLA blends are loaded into the hopper of a Plastic extrusion machine and it conveyed to the rotating screw of the machine. In the extruder, the PLA blends are heated to a particular temperature and then diversified. When the plastic within container is heated it becomes a melt, it can be extruded and then blown up with the help of circular die to give an inflated plastic sheet. 3. The inflated sheet of plastic is blown up vertically to a high level that further allows the material, a proper distribution and provides the required cooling time before the plastic film is flattened. 4. The ending step in the manufacturing process is to send the inflated sheet through a section of nip rollers to make the film flat and later roll the film into large cores. By altering the speed of the nip rolls, the bubble like formation can change its measurement and thickness of the film.

5. Following the extrusion process, the large coil of plastic films enters the converting department where the film roll is fed into an unwinder, where it’s subsequently converted to the plastic bags. The plastic roll is treated with an electrostatic wave of current where it starts to unwind. This is an “Optional” step and is carried out to appropriately prepare the film for the printing process, where the plastic bags are printed with logos and messages. 6. Either after the printing process or after the extrusion process, depending on weather any printing is done, the film is cut into the correct dimensions with hot knives that seal the ends of the bags together at the same time. 7. After the cutting and the sealing process, any material that is “Scrap” is reused again in the manufacturing process in order to minimize any waste material. 8. After this process, the plastic bags are packed in large bundles and then stored for dispatch. Fig.: Schematic diagram of the extrusion and blow up process. 4.4 YIELD OF PRODUCT/PRODUCTION RATIO The annual production capacity of this Biodegradable Plastic Plant can be something between 100 MT – 250 MT per year depending upon the capacity of the machines used.

7. LICENSE & APPROVALS To start the biodegradable plastic bag manufacturing process the different licenses and registrations from the different authorities regarding the area and machineries must be obtained initially. These laws vary from one state to the other. Besides them, the other certificates that must be obtained are: 1. A trade license from the local Municipal Body authority. 2. MSME Udyam Online registration 3. The GST (Goods and Service Tax) certification. 4. A “No-objection Certificate” from the Pollution Control Board. 5. A “No-objection Certificate” from the Fire Board. 8. SWOT ANALYSIS Strengths: On one hand when plastics take somewhere between 20 to 500 years for their degradation, Biodegradable plastics can be degraded by the natural forces within 5 years which is a major advantage over the normal plastics. The issue of Global Warming and rising levels of pollution are also spreading awareness among the people thus motivating them to use the biodegradable variety. Another major advantage of the Biodegradable plastic bag manufacturing is the fact that the raw materials are not sourced from petroleum. Weaknesses: Despite several environmental advantages, the Biodegradable have a range of shortcomings too. Segregation of the plastics and the biodegradable plastics is a major drawback as they look very similar. Moreover, they take a long amount of time to get decomposed and some of them even do not degrade under normal conditions and specified conditions are required for their degradation. Some of the biodegradable plastics release

greenhouse gases during decomposition, which is counterproductive to the environmental cause, thus restraining the market growth. Opportunities: With the rising awareness among the people regarding the different environmental concerns, the biodegradable plastics are to find a huge market and hence market in the near future. Threats: The major threat to the market is the fact that the PLA bags take a lot of time to decompose which might lead ways to other faster degrading materials.

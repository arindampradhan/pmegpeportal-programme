INTERLOCKING BRICKS Introduction: The block's sizes are modular and rectangular (250 mm length, 210 mm wide and125 mm high) in shape. Corner or junction block is required to maintain right angle corner or a proper T-junction. The interlocking block is different from conventional blocks or bricks since they do not require mortar for its laying work. Because of this characteristic, the process of building walls and other structures are faster as the blocks are laid dry and lock into place. Almost any type of building can be constructed with interlocking blocks, which has projection and depression to key each other. They are pre-cast solid products made out of cement concrete. The product is made in various sizes and shapes viz. rectangular, square and round blocks of different dimensions with designs for interlocking of adjacent tiles blocks. Shapes & sizes: A variety of interlocking blocks have been developed during the past years, differing in shapes and sizes, depending on the required strengths and uses. The system developed has the following shapes and forms:

---

(i) Full blocks (300 x 125 – 150 x 100 mm) for all standard walls (single or double block thick). (ii) Half blocks (150 x 125 - 150 x 100 mm), which can be molded to size, or made by cutting freshly molded full blocks in half. (iii) Channel blocks, same sizes as full and half blocks, but with a channel along the long axis, into which reinforcing steel and concrete can be placed to form lintels or ring beams. (iv) The vertical sides of the blocks can be flat or have recesses, and the vertical grout holes can be square or round. (v) Inserts for electrical switch housing and conduits as well as water piping outlets can be incorporated. (vi) Special blocks for window sills. Advantages of Interlocking Block: The advantages of interlocking Block are: (i) Construction with interlocking block saves time and ample amount of mortar concrete compared to conventional masonry block laid with mortar (ii) Areas prone to earthquake uses hollow interlocking block with the strength improved with grout and reinforcement throughout the height of the wall to resist the effect of earthquake, thus, providing adequate structural stability against collapse (iii) Having formed the base course, other course can be assembled by unskilled labour (iv) Dismantling of the blocks in case of temporary structure does not incur much damages as in blocks laid with mortar (v) Cost of construction is relatively less.

Market Potential: Interlocking cement tiles and paving blocks find applications in pavements, footpaths, gardens, passenger waiting sheds, bus-stops, industry and other public places. The product is commonly used in urban areas for the above applications. Hence, the unit may be set up in urban and semi-urban areas, near the market. A lot of face-lift is being given to roads, footpaths along the roadside. These bricks are ideal materials on the footpaths for easy laying, better look and finish. Whereas the tiles find extensive use outside the large building and houses, lots of these materials are also used in flooring in the open areas of public offices and commercial buildings and residential apartments. Machinery & equipment requirement: Basic machines & equipments are: Name Qty Price Hydraulically operated Concrete block making 3 800000 machine Concrete mixer capacity 1 90000 Water pump 1 40000 Colour mixer 1 100000 Other machines & equipments 50000 Raw materials: Basic raw material requirements are as follows: 1.

Manufacturing Process: The process of Manufacture of interlocking bricks involves the following steps: a) Proportioning b) Mixing c) Compacting d) Curing e) Drying Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1400Sqft. Civil work will cost around 5 Lac (approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 security Guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and sales personal each. Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require

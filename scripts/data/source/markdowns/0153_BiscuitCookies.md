PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE Biscuit manufacturing consists of four major processes mixing, forming, baking and packing. Mixing Mixing is a process where all ingredients are put together in right proportion for dough formation. These ingredients are then fed into Mixers where mixing is done and dough is prepared for molding. Major ingredients are flour, fat, sugar and others as per the product one would like to have. Mixing can be done in one stage, two stage or three stages. One stage or all in One is type of mixing where all ingredients and water are added once . Mixing is allowed till satisfactory dough is prepared . Normally this type of mixing is used for hard Dough. Two ‐ Stage mixing: Creaming: All ingredients are added with water and mixed 4‐5 minutes except for flour. 2nd stage: Flour with chemicals are then mix with the creaming product to form a consistent dough. 3

Three stages mixing: Stage One: fat, sugar with other ingredient like milk, chocolate, malt, honey etc are mixed and cream is prepared with portion of water. Stage two: Salt, chemical and flavors with colors are mixed with water. Stage three: Flour with water is then added to the prepared cream and mixed till satisfactory dough is prepared. Mixing process has following characteristics which have been monitored for better result. Method. Mixing time: Normally any mixing could be achieved within 15‐25 minutes. Much depends on mixing speed of mixer, flour characteristics or temperatures required for dough. Dough Temperatures : Very important factor the temperature ranges between 35 deg c ‐ 42 deg c as per biscuit variety . Temperatures are maintained by refrigerant equipments like chillers , direct expansion type chillers . In winter dough temperatures are maintained by heating equipments Dough consistency: This is done manually by checking dough and stretching the dough it should not break neither should it be so elastic . These methods are mastered by bakers by trial and error method. For cracker variety dough had additional ingredient yeast and dough are kept for 10‐ 24 hrs. 4

Different type of Dough Mixer DOUGH MIXERS The mixing stage is of great importance in biscuit‐making technology, as a good process starts from the head of the line. In the mixing stage, all ingredients must be uniformly and evenly incorporated in a consistent mass and transformed into a dough which can be processed by the next set of machines. Various mixing machines are available according to the type of dough to be handled. They include: Horizontal mixer, suitable for hard sweet and rotary molded biscuit dough. Vertical mixer, mainly used for cracker production, especially for the sponge and dough process. Planetary mixer, particularly suitable for soft dough, mainly for wire cut or deposited products; it can also be used for rotary moulded dough. Spiral mixer, much used in the bread industry, it is also suitable for rotary moulded dough. Each of these mixing systems has its advantages and disadvantages, so the choice of the mixer type, size and performance must be carefully evaluated by our specialists. HORIZONTAL MIXERS: Mixing arm is parallel to floor . Popular models are z arm sigma mixers . Tilting arrangement is available with options of dual speed with jackets for cold and water. 5

Forming In forming sections the dough is passed through several rolls to form sheets , these sheets are then converted into One uniform sheet of desired thickness it is normally 6‐5mm. Moulders and cutters are used to cut sheet or convert dough into desired shape and size Stages in forming laminators : Dough after mixing in tipped into laminators hoppers with some mechanical /pneumatic tilting . There are two type of laminators. Horizontal type laminators: If space is not the constraint then horizontal type laminators are the best selection as the maintenance and repairs are easily done. The lamination and the controls are visible . Changing webs and rolls are very 7

easy . Pneumatics and servo motors are used in now modern day laminators for automated speed to be synchronized with rest of the plant .11‐14 sheet per batch. Vertical type laminators : Vertical type of laminators have been there for very long its useful if space is a constraint. Dough is passed through three stage rollers and after lamination of sheet it cut into sheets which are then carried to rollers through inclined webs. Gauge roll stands . Reduction in sheet is achieved through numerous gauge roll s stand . Popular are three stand gauge rolls or four stand gauge roll . Reduction are achieved in stages as not to create too much stress on the sheet , webs are provided in between for relaxation even an additional web is provided prior to 8

These gauge roll are of different diameter depending upon the plant capacity could be as small as 6" ,8"' , 10" , 12''and 14'' . Speed are set as per plant and cutter rpm . Gauge roll speed has to be increased in every stand so as to maintain the flow of sheets Dough sheet conditioning: Dough sheet conditioning is done as per the ambient conditions in the plant. Steam spray ‐ to moist the web surface Blower : to dry the dough surface. Flour dusting : to dry the wet surface of the dough . Above process is mainly for cutting Variety . Toppings: Toppings are done through mechanical, vibratory or sprays. Means where a hopper is placed above the plant line after the cutter . The toppings could be milk, salt, sugar or cashew, pista bits. Rotary cutter: 9

Role of Ingredients.(Raw Material) Sugar Primary role of sugar in bread and biscuit is provide sweetness( taste) to the product . Color to the product due to carmalisation . Color of the crust in bread loaves is due to the sugar . Basic role of sugar is to activate the yeast to produce carbon dioxide and alochol during bread manufacturing . Note: When preparing for mixing yeast is separately being put into ammonium chloride and sugar solution . Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil ‐( HVO )Main function of HVO is to retain the moisture inside the dough. Give smoothness to the bite . Salt It provides taste to the product. Salt act as controlling agent against wild yeast activity . Thus controlled yeast activity can provide better texture or network . GMS ( Glycerol Mono stearate)‐ Its act as emulsifier which binds together the oil and water molecules and it helps bread to hold moisture. SSL ( Sodium Stearoyl lactilate)‐ It is also known as Smoother . It is a compound which retains softness in bread and delays staling of bread . 16

SMP ( Skimmed Milk Powder)‐ Solution‐Main function of Skimmed milk powder is to give flavour to the product and sweetens the product. Ammonium Chloride‐ Ammonium chloride provides Nitrogen which used to activate yeast in presence of water and sugar. Yeast‐It is an unicellular living organism . Its growth is max at higher humidity and temperature 45 deg c . Yeast action on food releases carbon dioxide which gets entrapped in dough and gives puffiness to the product after baking . Yeast are used for sour dough products or Sponge dough products . Sponge are prepared in cracker production yeast is added during mixing are then kept for 18‐20 hrs before production. Commercial yeast are of two types ‐ Compressed yeast and Dry yeast Compressed yeast ‐ These can be further classified as Breweries yeast ‐ It acts on malt to give alcohol and carbon dioxide. Distillers yeast‐ It acts on molasses to give alcohol and carbon dioxide . Bakers yeast ‐ It acts on sugar to produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. Carbon dioxide is the main by product. 17

BISCUIT PLANT LAYOUT The following plant layout are most suitable for biscuit production line. Mixing areas has to be double storied as premixing has to be done on the first floor which helps in putting ingredient s to the mixers and in some cases dough to the laminators . Provision for good s elevator has to be kept as ingredients has to be moved to upper floor . Roof has to be provided with natural ventilation so as to reduce the temperatures of baking hall . Packing hall could be on the same floor or could be on the first floor. Basement could be made for raw material storage. H‐ Shaped plant layout The most popular biscuit plant lay out is H shaped or I shaped. The mixing and packaging section occupies the ends are the ovens the main section. H section is the ideal plant layout where we can have mixing section near to the production line . Packing section is also best placed in H type plant layout Highlights of H type plants.  Mixing and packing at the ends  Production flow is smooth  Pre ‐Mixing can be done on the same floor  No bends hence less maintenance of 90 deg conveyors  Less wastages 21

Energy Conservation: The following steps may be taken for the conservation of energy. 1. Machinery & Equipment’s parts, which are revolving and reciprocating should be properly, lubricated from time to time with suitable lubricant oil. 2. Lay out of the unit should be in such a way in that no back tracking of material is there. 3. All electric switches may be kept off, when not required. 4. The entire transmission belt will be tightened before starting the work is wherever applicable. 5. Fluorescent tube with electronic Chokes may be used for energy saving. Further recently developed compact fluorescent tubes called (CFT) of 10,15, watts Philips/Glaux made may be used for energy saving and decoration. These self ballasted fluorescent lamps are high efficiency replacements for ordinary bulbs. For same light output, CFLEBs consume about one‐fifth the power consumed by ordinary bulbs, thereby saving a lot of energy. The savings get further multiplied when CLEBs are used in air conditioned areas, since the saving of energy by using CLEBs also corresponds to less heat dissipation reducing load on air conditioners. The life of CFLEBs is about 8000/10000 hours i.e. about 10 times that of ordinary bulb. The typical payback period in terms of savings of energy bills and cost 27

## Page 27

of ordinary lamps is about 6 months operation. Unlike ordinary bulbs, these CFLEBs provide choice of three colours designated A, B & C, to suit individual requirements. Electronic Ballast, with protection against high voltage spikes, along with high quality CFLs make these composite CFLEBs (or self ballasted CFLs) Slim, lightweight, efficient and reliable units. 6. As far as possible Solar Energy and day light will be used keeping all the other lights off. 7. As far as possible inductive load of motor will be reduced and high power factor will be used with the aid of capacitors of appropriate sizes. 8. It is desirable for an oven to have a higher production capacity , a short come‐uptime, a higher reliability and energy efficiency ( with least thermal radiation ) and less maintenance requirement. Pollution Control: 1. This industry may be involves pollution to some extent for which State Pollution Control Board has to be approached. 2. Minimum height of shed will be maintained with exhaust fans should be installed for removing decongestion proper ventilation, removal of cokes fumes etc. 28

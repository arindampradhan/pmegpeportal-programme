TEXTILE SCREEN PRINTING INTRODUCTION Textile printing refers to the production of designs of any kind that could not be made on textile fabrics by normal weaving/knitting techniques. Before the printing process, the cloth should be thoroughly prepared by different wet process namely designing, scouring and bleaching. Printing is mainly done on finished fabrics, curtain clothes, ladies dress materials, bed sheets, bed covers, fabric for children garments, gents shirts etc. to improve its attractiveness, marketability etc. Screen printing can be done in single colour or in combination of different colours as per end use requirement. Colour combination is an important area by which the appearance of an ordinary fabric can be improved to a maximum extent. It is, therefore, necessary that the quality printing material, chemicals and printing screen should be good so that printed items are fully accepted in the market.

MARKET POTENTIAL With regard to marketability of the product in general, printed items have good market potential both in domestic and export market. In populated country like India, there is no problem of marketing printed fabrics as the requirement tends to increase and also these items will satisfy individual customerâ€™s needs and requirements in terms of colour combination, design requirements etc. BASIS AND ASSUMPTIONS This project is based on single shift basis and 300 working days in a year and time period for achieving maximum capacity utilisation is considered from 5th year from the date on which production is started. The costs of machinery and equipment/material indicated refer to a particular make and approximate to those prevailing at the time of preparation of this project. IMPLEMENTATIONSCHEDULE The implementation period for executing different types of work right from selection of site/working shed and forming of company to selection of market channel and miscellaneous work will take a total period of 6 months. However, on considering that some of the activities may be overlapping, the actual project implementation may hardly take 3 months. TECHNICAL ASPECTS Process of Manufacture The various steps involved in printing process are preparation of printing paste, printing of fabric, fixation of dye stuff by curing/steaming, washing off, calendaring, folding and packing. Scoured and bleached cotton fabric as obtained from dealers is inspected to remove any objectionable faults and stretched evenly on printing table. Screens containing the designs is placed over the table and the dye paste is pressed over the screen by means of rubber squeezer. The selection of dyes and gums depends on the construction of basic cloth to be printed and their end use. After printing, the printed clothes are cured or steamed for the fixation of the colour. Later, the printed material is thoroughly washed to remove loose dye stuffs. Then, it is calendared, folded and packed for the delivery.

Quality Control and Standards A quality printed item should have good fastness to washing, rubbing and light. This can be achieved by properly fixing the print on the cloth by curing or steaming. Dyes to be used should be of good quality and capable of giving bright shades. Printing quality is not covered by any specifications. Pollution Control Textile printing does not necessarily produce sufficient effluents (except washing section) so as to create pollution problems. However, a no objection certificate from the State Pollution Control Board is required before setting up of the project. Energy Conservation Wastage of energy should be minimised as much as possible so that the unit can withstand competition with similar unit.

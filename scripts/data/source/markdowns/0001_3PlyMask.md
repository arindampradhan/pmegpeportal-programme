Surgical Masks are widely used by medical practitioner during any operation or medical procedure which involves direct treatment of any internal body parts, so as to prevent patient from bacterias which are present in exhaled breath of the practitioner, so as to prevent any possible infection to patient and on the flip side it protects practitioner from accidently ingesting any bodily fluid during operation. As these masks are to be used in medical procedure hence cleanliness protocol demands these masks be disposed after each such operation, thus they are use and throw masks, therefore have an essential financial requirement of being low cost product which is obtained by mass production and cheap raw material. RAW MATERIAL Spun-Bound Polypropylene Roll Melt Blown Polypropylene Roll Polyamide Elastic Band Reel Packaging Material

MANUFACTURING PROCESS The two spun-bound polypropylene rolls and a melt blown polypropylene roll are placed in roll feeding section at appropriate locations while, polyamide elastic band reel is placed in ear loop welding section of non-woven surgical mask making machine. The non-woven surgical mask making machine unrolls the sheet of two spun- bound polypropylene and melt blown polypropylene simultaneously from their respective rolls and pulls them into edge seam welding section. All these layers are welded at edges so as to obtain a continuous mask material; the outer most layer is made of spun bound polypropylene sheet and acts as external non-woven fabric sheet of mask, second layer is made of melt blown polypropylene sheet and acts as filtration layer of mask, while third layer is made of another spun-bound polypropylene sheet and form inner skin contact layer of mask. This welded material is then feed to folding section which folds the mask so as to allow the mask to take appropriate shape required to cover users face when in application, in order to make the folds to set the mask material is passed through a hot press just after folding.

The mask material is then feed to cutting and welding section which cuts the mask material into the width of masks, which are then welded at edges so as to obtain the mask’s body; these mask bodies are separated into multiple lines each having its own ear loop welding section which welds the ear loop onto the mask, cut from polyamide elastic band; thus surgical masks are obtained from machine. These surgical masks are then feed to packaging machine which simply packs them into an appropriate plastic packaging, followed by which masks are packed in cartons and sent for sale. MARKET OVERVIEW The India surgical mask market accounted for ₹4,060 million approx. in 2017, and is projected to reach ₹ 6,650 million approx. by 2025, registering a CAGR of 6.1% from 2018 to 2025.

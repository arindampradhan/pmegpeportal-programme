PET PREFORMS 1. INTRODUCTION A PET preform is an intermediate product that is subsequently blown into a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) container. Preforms vary in neck finish, weight, colour and shape, and are specifically designed to meet the needs of customers in different market segments. Preforms can be single-layer or multilayer. PET Preforms are produced by using a highly-accurate injection molding process and equipment. Preform weight depends on the end container’s desired volume. Barrier preforms provide additional benefits and increased beverage shelf life. PET Preforms are used to make bottles especially convenience-sized soft drinks, juices and water. There is one characteristic of PET preform, which is the product that made from it will be clear and transparent. The surface is smooth and sparking, which can attract the buyer´s attention. This makes the PET preform a delicate product. On the other hand, although the PET preform can create a similar sensation just like glass. It’s not fragile as glass. The wall is strong and tough, which appears on the container.

2. MARKET POTENTIAL: PET preforms offer reasonable packaging solution in terms of cost, which are used in packaging of bottled water, carbonated soft drinks, edible oil, and other special care & domestic goods. The demand for PET preforms has been increased in the last decade due to high consumption of convenient food & beverages products such as ready-to-drink coffee, tea, soft drinks, and juices in both developed and developing countries. The hot filling process is common in developed countries, which is boosting the PET preforms bottles market as it requires low capital investments and excludes the usage of preservers. Increasing consumption of packaged drinking water is significantly responsible for a heightened prospect of PET preforms market. The global PET preforms market is expected to reach USD 23.35 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.31% from 2017 to 2022. In terms of volume, the market size is projected to reach 552.64 Billion units by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2017 to 2022.

## Page 6

In PET Preforms the quality of PET resin is the most important consideration. Generally, those PET resins are used in which antimony concentration is less than 300mg. In the first step, the raw material is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. PET naturally absorbs water from its surroundings. So, it is preheated before start manufacturing to reduce the moisture content. PET resins are heated to a temperature of 110 – 115℃ for near about 4 hours. This heating will reduce the moisture content to less than 50 parts per million. The moisture balance is an important step to avoid hydrolytic reaction which reduces the PET quality by generation of acetaldehyde. In the next step, the PET resins are poured into the injection moulding machine manually. The profile dies of desired preform shape of preform are mounted precisely into the machine after approval from the production team. The profile dies have more than one cavity of preform shape. Generally, mould dies have cavities as per the weight of preform. For 14-gram weight preform 16 cavity dies are available. In the next step, barrel heaters are started and brought up to the desired melting temperature of PET. The resins from the hopper are fed into the barrel section of the machine where the screw mounted in the machine rotates about horizontal axis. The resins are fed into heating zone as the screw rotates. In the heating zone, resins melts to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the die cavity by the machine. From the extruder of the machine this molten semi-fluid plastic is injected into the die at desired pressure and temperature. The molten plastic will acquire the shape of the die and cooling cycle of the machine begins. Water is used as a cooling medium which transfers heating through a suitable cooling arrangement. The molten plastic gets solidified and acquires the shape of the die. After this, when the cooling cycle completes the mold gets opened and the ejector pin will eject the preforms outside. These preforms have the threaded portion for cap mounting.

The non-uniform or deformed products are crushed using grinder into small pieces. After this, the preforms are packed and dispatched as per the requirement. PLANT AND MACHINERY: 1. Injection Moulding Machine – Injection molding is a method to obtain molded products by injecting plastic materials molten by heat into a mold, and then cooling and solidifying them. The method is suitable for the mass production of products with complicated shapes, and takes a large part in the area of plastic processing. 2. Grinder – This machine is used to crush the waste or non-uniform products into small pieces.

3. Water Chiller – This is used to cool down the heated water required during the cooling cycle of the blow moldings machine.

Equipment’s: Profile Dies – A die is a specialized tool used in manufacturing industries to cut or shape material mostly using a press. Pump – Pumps are used to transfer the oil from crude oil tank to filter cloth.

## Page 1

KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON HIGH DUTY IRON CASTINGS Introduction : High duty cast irons are inoculated with calcium silicide. It is essentially a gray iron containing free graphite which is graphitised in a controlled manner in the ladle. Also known as Mechanite iron castings for its properties like ductility, high resistance to shok, toughness is widely used in the manufacture of agricultural implements, machine tool beds etc. 1 Name of the Product : HIGH DUTY IRON CASTING 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft RENTED 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 933,000.00 Rotary Furnace of 1MT cap.

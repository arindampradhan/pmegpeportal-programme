POTATO CHIPS UNIT Introduction Potato chips (often just chips) (North American English), or crisps (British English), are thin slices of potato that have been deep fried or baked until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavourings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavours, artificial flavours, and additives. Potato chips form a large part of the snack food and convenience food market in Western countries. In the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass-produced for home consumption. Advantages of Potato chips 1. Bone health: The iron, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, and zinc in potatoes all help the body to build and maintain bone structure and strength. 2. Blood pressure: Potassium, calcium, and magnesium are all present in the potato. These have been found to decrease blood pressure naturally. 3. Heart Health: Potatoes contain significant amounts of fibre. Fibre helps lower the total amount of cholesterol in the blood, thereby decreasing the risk of heart disease. 4. Inflammation: Choline is an important and versatile nutrient that is present in potatoes. It helps with muscle movement, mood, learning, and memory. 5. Digestion & regularity: The fibre content in potatoes helps prevent constipation and promote regularity for a healthy digestive tract.

3. De-stoner 4. Peeler 5. Inspection conveyor 6. Slicer 7. De-oiling conveyor 8. Heat exchanger These Machines are used to produce potato chips from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, extruding, heating, frying & packaging completes in a very short span. Popcorn Market Analysis The global potato chips market size was worth US$ 29 Billion in 2018. The market is further projected to reach a value of US$ 35 Billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 3.3% during 2019-2024. Potato chips represent one of the most popular snack foods consumed across the globe. These are thin slices of potato which are seasoned after being fried until crisp. At the time of frying, the sugar present in potatoes combine with amino acids and turns brown which results in the yellowish- brown colour of potato chips. In addition to this, potato chips are processed and stored in such a way that they are inert towards any microbiological spoilage, chemical and enzymatic activities as well as moisture or other vapour migration. The taste, texture and colour of the chips remain unaltered for a long period of time. Apart from this, potato chips are generally packed and sold in air-tight plastic bags which significantly increases the longevity of the products. Potato chips Manufacturing Process When the potatoes arrive at the plant, they are examined and tasted  for quality. A half dozen or so buckets are randomly filled. Some are punched with holes in their cores so that they can be tracked through the cooking process. The potatoes are examined for green edges and blemishes. The pile of defective potatoes is weighed; if the weight

exceeds a company's preset allowance, the entire truckload can be rejected. The potatoes move along a conveyer belt to the various stages of  manufacturing. The conveyer belts are powered by gentle vibrations to keep breakage to a minimum. Destoning and peeling The potatoes are loaded into a vertical helical screw conveyer which  allows stones to fall to the bottom and pushes the potatoes up to a conveyer belt to the automatic peeling machine. After they have been peeled, the potatoes are washed with cold water. Slicing The potatoes pass through a revolving impaler/presser that cuts them  into paper-thin slices, between 0.066-0.072 in (1.7-1.85 mm) in thickness. Straight blades produce regular chips while rippled blades produce ridged potato chips. The slices fall into a second cold-water wash that removes  the starch released when the potatoes are cut. Some manufacturers, who market their chips as natural, do not wash the starch off the potatoes. Colour treatment If the potatoes need to be chemically treated to enhance their colour, it  is done at this stage. The potato slices are immersed in a solution that has been adjusted for p H, hardness, and mineral content. Frying and salting The slices pass under air jets that remove excess water as they flow  into 40-75 ft (12.2-23 m) troughs filled with oil. The oil temperature is kept at 350-375°F (176.6-190.5°C). Paddles gently push the slices along. As the slices tumble, salt is sprinkled from receptacles positioned above the trough at the rate of about 1.75 lb (0.79 kg) of salt to each 100 lb (45.4 kg) of chips. Potato chips that are to be flavoured pass through a drum filled with  the desired powdered seasonings.

Cooling and sorting At the end of the trough, a wire mesh belt pulls out the hot chips.  As the chips move along the mesh conveyer belt, excess oil is drained off and the chips begin to cool. They then move under an optical sorter that picks out any burnt slices and removes them with puffs of air. Packaging The chips are conveyed to a packaging machine with a scale. As  the pre-set weight of chips is measured, a metal detector checks the chips once more for any foreign matter such as metal pieces that could have come with the potatoes or been picked up in the frying process. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Description Value Machinery price 10,75,000 GST @ 18% 1,93,500 Total Cost 12,68,500 * Machine Value is exclusive of other transportation cost.

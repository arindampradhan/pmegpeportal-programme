ENGINE COOLANT MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: An engine coolant, also known as an “Anti-freeze” is a liquid that runs through the engines of the Automobiles to keep it within its correct operating temperature or resists over-heating of the engine. It is generally prepared with Ethylene Glycol or Propanol along with some additives. It is generally green, pink, or blue in color. The engines of the automobiles produce a lot of heat when they are running and should be cooled continuously to avoid engine damage. The cooling system in the cars, send the coolant through the passages in the engine blocks and heads. As the coolant runs through these passages, it picks up the excess heat thereby causing a decrease in the temperature of the car engine. The heated liquid finds its way to the radiator of the car through the rubber hose. As it flows through the thin tubes in the radiator, the hot liquid is cooled by the stream of air entering the engine compartment from the grill in front of the car. Once the fluid is cooled, it returns back to the engine to pick up more heat. Water alone cannot keep the engine cool as due to the intense heat from the engine fuel burning, the water would ultimately evaporate. Likewise, at extremely cold temperature conditions, the water inside would freeze into ice therefore it would be unable to move.

Uses & Market Potential: The major use of the engine Coolant to cool the engines by absorbing the heat that is radiated by the car engines due to the exothermic reaction that takes place due to the burning of the fuel. Depending on the engine type, few other additives are added to the engine along with the Coolant. The global Antifreeze/Coolant market is estimated at USD 5.4 Billion in 2020 and is predicted to reach USD 5.9 Billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 1.8 %. The growth drive is primarily influenced by the increasing demand for passenger cars as well as luxury cars. Besides the increasing demand for vehicles in the market, there are other factors that influence the market such as overall economic growth, the development in the chemical industries, etc. The Indian market has emerged in this sector with a CAGR of 6 % in the forecast period of 2019 – 2025. The automotive industry has grown rapidly in India, as the demand for both passenger and commercial vehicles has increased to 7.32% and 9.08% respectively over the last two years (2017-2018). This increase in the sales of vehicle has significantly increased the demand for coolants in the country. Product: Engine Coolant Raw Material: Basic raw material is Ethylene Glycol, Benzotriazole, Sodium Benzoate, Toyltriazole, Sodium Molybdate, Triethanolamine, Phosphoric Acid, Antifoaming agent, Dyestuff and Water.

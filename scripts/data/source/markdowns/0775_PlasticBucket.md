PLASTIC BUCKET Introduction: Thermoplastic materials like PP homopolymer, recycled PP and clarified PP can be injection moulded into buckets of different sizes and shapes. Some of the common items that are produced from PP include buckets, cans and mugs. Their light weight, flexibility, corrosion resistance and chemical resistance have made these plastic products popular for storage and handling of water, petrol, diesel etc. This project profile is based on 10 Ltr capacity Plastic Bucket. Uses & Market Potential: Bucket is a conventional utensils being used in house since long. Plastic bucket is strong, rough & tough in use. The metal bucket has threatened it to same extent but could not replace it due to issues occurring for pitting and corrosion issues, that is due to salty the water which varies from place to place. Buckets are known for its durability. Even now

there is wide scope of the bucket not only is rural area but also in urban houses and industries. This is a basic household product and is in daily use therefore the demand is always there in Urban as well as in Rural areas. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Polypropylene(PP Granules) 2. Colourant 3. Metal Handle Machine Requirement: Major machinery and equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Injection Molding Machine 1 2200000 2200000 Air Compressor 1 50000 50000 Cooling Tower 1 350000 350000 Scrap Grinder 1 250000 250000 Dry colour mixer 1 200000 200000 Crane(Manual) 1 450000 450000 Mold Cost Ls 200000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 3750000 Manufacturing Process: In this injection moulding process, the cold, hard plastic material is loaded into the machine via hopper, plasticized by heating and then injected under pressure into a cold mould, where it sets and is then ejected as the finished products. The main process steps involved are – • Plastic material in the form of granules is subjected to heat and pressure in an extruder.

• Semi-molten plastic in extruder passed through the nozzle known as Parison. Adjustments have to be made in the machine to vary the wall thickness of the parison. • Suitable parison is then inserted in a mould and air is blown into parison to force the molten plastic against the sides of the mould. • The material is then cooled before removal from the mould. • The article is then trimmed to remove flashes. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

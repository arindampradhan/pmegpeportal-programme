KNITTED LACE PRODUCTION UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Lace is a delicate fabric made of yarn or thread in an open web like pattern made by machine or by hand. Generally, lace is divided into two main categories, needle lace, and bobbin lace. There are other types of lace, such as knitted or crocheted lace. Other laces such as these are considered as a category of their specific craft. Knitted lace, therefore, is an example of knitting. A highly elastic form of lace, knitted lace is a type of knit fabric that features a large number of small holes. Commonly used to make shawls and table covers, knitted lace is very difficult to make, earlier it cannot be made with machines. The wonderful thing about knitted lace is that despite its apparent intricacy, it follows a simple logic. The openings are created by special increases called yarnovers, and each yarnover is accompanied by a compensating decrease. Traditional laceweight yarn yields beautiful lace patterns, but sport, worsted, and bulky yarns can be equally effective. A smooth, light-colored fingering or sport weight yarn worked on a needle three to four sizes larger than you’d normally use creates a fluid fabric in which the lace pattern is visible. But fuzzy yarns and dark, variegated colors yield impressive results, too.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Commonly used to make shawls and table covers. Lace is mainly used as a decorative addition to other textile products. Winter wears often feature multiple lace segments, and it’s also relatively common to add lace to other formal and informal women’s garments. Knitted lace is used to make gloves, socks, and sweaters. Lace is also a popular fabric for homewares. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Production Process  Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in; dust-free, moisture-free, neat, and clean environment. Production Process Bobbin lace: To produce bobbin lace, textile manufacturers load thread or yarn onto approximately 20 different bobbins. They then feed these bobbins onto a pillow attached to a spindle, and they form the desired lace pattern on the pillow using pins. The first automated lace-making machines followed the bobbin lace method, and automated bobbin lace is produced using a similar (yet more efficient) process.

Needle lace: Needle lace appears to predate bobbin lace, and while exquisitely beautiful, this type of lace is incredibly time-consuming to make. In most cases, textile manufacturers make needle lace by affixing guiding threads to a stiff background and filling in the desired pattern with tiny stitches. While modern textile manufacturing machinery can approximate needle lace with reasonable fidelity, there is simply no substitute for this exquisite, handmade type of lace fabric. Chemical lace: Textile manufacturers make chemical lace by embroidering a pattern on a type of fabric that is not resistant to caustic chemicals. Then, the lace is bathed in chemicals until the base fabric dissolves, leaving only the lace pattern intact. While it is easier to stitch chemical lace, this type of lace is not as high-quality as bobbin or needle lace. Knitted lace: Once the yarn has been sourced, it is winded into cones using a winding machine. The thread or yarn can also be sourced wounded. The yarn is then distributed to operators at manufacturing facilities. Knitters will then knit lace on a flat knitting machine according to a design panel. Weaving is a process of making cloth by interlacing threads perpendicular to each other usually accomplished with a hand- or power-operated loom. A loom is any machine or device that holds the threads and helps to weave them. The weaving machine has multiple needles that each correspond to a specific thread and they work together to create a lace-like structure. Panel knitting involves knitting specific areas of the garment referred to as panels. Then, during the knitting process, a separation thread is inserted between the panels which allows them to be divided without cutting them. Finally, once the panels are knitted, the separation thread is removed. And lace will be sent for testing. Before that embroidery can also be done. Soluble toppers will be placed upon lace and by using a multi-head embroidery machine; embroidery work will be performed if required. The dying process can also be done if required.

Testing: Quality Control: Manual inspection, trimming of loose fabrics or strings. 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000- 3000 square feet. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs.30000.00 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Lace Knitting or weaving Machine Knitting machines work by automating all or part of the knitting process. They can produce a variety of different knitted fabrics, mostly dependent upon the size of the yarn used. Specialty machines like automatic patterning machines can also create custom patterns.

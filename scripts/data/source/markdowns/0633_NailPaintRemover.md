NAIL PAINT REMOVER UNIT Introduction: Nail polish or Nail Paint remover is an organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvents that may also include other oils, fragrances, and mild colors which is used to remove the nail polish from our nails. The most commonly used chemical is “Acetone” while an alternative remover is “Ethyl Acetate” which often also contains Isopropyl Alcohol and along with it “Butyl Acetate” and “Propylene Carbonate” are also used all Nail paint removers. “Acetonitrile” can also be used as the Remover but it is more toxic than the previously mentioned options and thus has been banned in different parts of Europe. These Nail polish removers are designed to soften the polishes so that the coating on the nails can be easily removed. Most of these solvents are extremely volatile in nature and thus the nail polish remover may totally be converted to the vapor state if the bottle is kept open for some time. It is due to this phenomenon that they help in removing the nail polish. Initially Acetone was used for this purpose which has the molecular formula: C H O. It can be found both 3 6 naturally as well as occurs in the nature. Though acetone is the best remover to remove the Nail polish, it is quite harmful to both the Nails as well as the Skin and prolonged use of the chemicals make the nails brittle and the leaves the skin dry.

11. Fragrance: 1 – 2 % Manufacturing Process: 1. The process begins in a Reactor vessel with a motor that is connected to a shaft to which appropriate propellers are attached. In this vessel, Ethyl acetate, Isopropyl Alcohol, and Ethyl Methyl Ketone are added first and rotated on a medium speed. Color pigments, if any color is required is added next for a homogenous mixing of the color with the solvent. Next, the gelling agent which is ethyl cellulose is added to the vortex. The gelling agent may require 15 – 30 minutes to completely mix with the contents of the solution. 2. After the addition of the thickening agent, the viscosity of the liquid is measured and then Propylene glycol and Isopropyl Myristate are added. Following this, a certain amount of D. M. water is added if the mixture feels too much viscous. 3. Finally, the Anti-oxidants and the Fragrances are added and the concoction is then allowed to settle down in storage tanks. 4. The products are generally packed either is plastic bottles with inner seals or in glass bottle. These bottles are neatly labelled and then they are filled placed on a conveyor with a filling device that fills a measured amount of the liquid into the bottles. 5. These bottles are then packed in cartons of corrugated board or film laminates and sent to the storage till they are dispatched Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is

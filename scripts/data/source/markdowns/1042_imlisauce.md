1. INTRODUCTION Tamarind is a hardwood tree known scientifically as Tamarindus indica. Imli is a delicious, sweet, and sour fruit that has a wide variety of uses, both for medicinal and culinary purposes. It is a medium-sized bushy tree with evergreen leaves and a fruit that develops in pods characterized by long, brown shells. Inside is a sticky, fleshy, juicy pulp, which is the tamarind fruit. Tamarinds also contain high levels of tartaric acid, just as citrus fruits contain citric acid, providing not just a zing to the taste buds, but evidence of powerful antioxidant action zapping harmful free radicals floating through your system. Tamarind is a fruit that is popular in the foods of Southeast Asia, North Africa, and India. While tamarinds are typically sweet and sour in flavour, they tend to become sweeter as they ripen. Due to their sweet, robust flavour, tamarinds are common in candies, chutneys, jams, desserts, steak sauces, and Worcestershire sauce. In addition to its high energy and fibre content, tamarind is a great source of B-vitamins and several minerals. Tamarind sauce is prepared by boiling tamarind pulp in sufficient sugar and acid. Tamarind sauce is brownish-black coloured and is of delicious texture.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Imli sauce is used with various Indian and foreign snacks. It can also be used in various Indian recipes. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Sauce Making Process  Packing  Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done. Fresh mature but unripe imli are usually selected and fruits that are ripe, overripe, infected, or damaged area to be discarded. The fruits are rinsed well in clean water. The pods are cracked by hand and they will be stored in; dust-free, moisture-free, neat, and clean environment for further processing. Sauce Making Process  Soaking: Raw imli will be kept for soaking in the kettle or respective utensils. If required, imli will be de-lumped manually for proper soaking. Then the imli is soaked for 3-4 hours at 55ºC in 1000-liter capacity tanks. Water is used in the ratio of 1:2.  De-seeding: Then imli de-seeding will be done. By squeezing them, the flesh will be separated from the seeds. Here the sticky pulp is pulled away from the tamarind seeds. The raw fruit is then steeped in hot water for thirty minutes and drained through a sieve to remove the fibrous threads.  Pulping: Then, heat the mass gently till the pulp becomes soft. extraction of the pulp with the aid of an extractor will be done here. De-seeding and pulping can also be done by using two way fully automatic machine. The pulp extraction process involves 3 stages of operations as follows

a. De-stoner is used for removing seeds and large size fibers & extracting pulp from the soaked tamarind. It has a 6mm sieve size b. Pulper (with 2mm sieve size) - In the pulper, there is the rotating body, below it there is a sieve of size 2mm; the particle which has lesser than 3mm penetrates through the filter. The remaining unwanted waste such as seed, fiber, and skin are separated automatically. c. Finisher/ refiner - The Finisher is similar to pulper but there is a sieve of 1mm.  Cooking: The pulp is heated by indirect contact of steam at 85+/-2 ºC. The pre-heating process also pasteurizes the pulp by inactivating bacterial activity. The tubular heat exchanger is particularly suited to the thermal treatment of products with a high viscosity range as well as products containing solids, pulps, or fibrous products. The required amount of water will be added to the pulp and will boil with little heating. Stirring of the mass will be done by automatic machine and it will be removed from the kettle. The pulp obtained is once again taken to the kettle where it is once again concentrated to one.  Mixing: All the other ingredients such as Sugar, Cumin Powder, Edible common salt, Black salt, Acidity regulator acetic acid, Chilli powder, Emulsifying & Stabilizing agent, Preservatives, Additives- Dry ginger, etc. will be mixed with the prepared pulp. Preservatives such as Sodium Benzoate and Potassium metabisulphite can be added to sauces to help preserve the products after the bottle has been opened.  Packing: After QC product will be sent for packing. Where, as per requirement it will be packed in a sachet or bottles. If glass jars are used for packaging, then they need to be hot- filled with the sauce. If the glass jars are cold, there is the risk of breaking when the hot liquid is added. Glass jars with screw-on lids are preferable. Alternatively, plastic jars covered with foil lids can also be used or the sauce can be cooled and filled into polyethylene bags or pouches which are heat- sealed.

Testing Quality control: Quality control plays a major role in the overall success of the unit. You must produce the imli sauce according to the standards laid down under the FPO. The imli sauce must be free from fermented odour in production or storage. Also, the product must not generate any fungal or bacterial effect. Mention the expiry date on the labels. 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 3000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.20,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1500 Sq ft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 1000 Sq ft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sq ft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sq ft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery This is a semi-automatic type of plant and the production capacity is set to be 320 Kg of Imli Sauce per day. Machines- Washer This utensil or machine is used for raw ingredient washing as well as soaking.

MACHINERY REQUIREMENT Basic Machinery requirement are as follows: 1. Weighing Machine The first thing is to receive the milk and in milk receiving section the milk which is received is first weighed with the help of a weighing machine. Milk is weighed in Kg. 2. Milk Storage Tank In dairy and milk processing industry a bulk milk storage tank is a large storage tank for holding the milk at a cold temperature until it can be picked up by a milk hauler. It is made up of stainless steel and is used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition.

3. Milk Evaporator The process of evaporation is widely used to concentrate liquid such as milk, so as to make concentrated milk called condensed milk and this is done by evaporating water from the milk. In process of concentration the aim of evaporation is to vaporize most of the water from a solution and give the desired result for which milk evaporator is used. 4. Milk Homogenizer This equipment is used in the production of condensed milk in which milk is forced through a small passage at high velocity. This machine reduces fat globule size to a very small size in order to prevent cream formation.

5. Baby Boiler Boilers are basically used in dairy industry for heating of milk and milk pasteurization. Milk boilers ensures good shelf life. It is also said that boilers are heart and soul of dairy industry. 6. Refrigerator Milk refregerators are basically used to store milk and help in the process of cooling which increases the shelf life of the milk and prevents it from destroying. It’s made up of stainless steel and it’s also an important dairy farm equipment.

7. Can Washing Machine Can Washing Machine be used to wash the tin containers and can in which condensed milk is to be stored and packed. Before packaging process takes place, the cans or tins are washed in can washing machine. 8. Condensed Milk Filling Machine This equipment is used to fill the finished product in cans or tins of different sizes and the product is ready for sale in the market.’ Raw Material: Basic Raw material requirement are as follows: 1. Milk 2. Sugar 3. Cans 4. Chemicals, Preservatives etc.

Manufacturing Process: Process description for Condensed Milk is defined below: • Pre-heating: It is an important stage in manufacturing process in which, bacteria and specially yeast and moulds are destroyed. It basically refers to heating of milk before it is condensed and, in this process, milk is being heated at a temperature which ranges from 85-90°C for 10 to 20 minutes. • Addition of Sugar: After the above process sugar is added. It is necessary to boil the sugar solution to destroy all yeast and spores. The amount of sugar is adjusted in the milk to give a final constitution of 40- 45 percent. • Condensing: The basic principle used for the removal of water from standardized milk is boiling, and boiling is performed under partial vacuum at a low temperature till the desired concentration is reached. This operation is carried out within an evaporator. • Homogenization: The hot condensed milk is homogenized before it is cooled and crystallized. The objective is to have a uniform fat emulsion and to reduce fat separation to a minimum during storage. • Cooling & Crystallization: In order to obtain the smoothest possible texture, the crystals of lactose should be as small as possible. This is obtained by rapid cooling and seeding with finely powdered lactose.

• Packaging: The condensed milk is now ready for packaging. Bulk packaging may be done in barrels of various sizes like drums or tin containers. For the retail market cans are preferred. After filling cans are sealed, labelled and packed in cases for storage and distribution in the local market.

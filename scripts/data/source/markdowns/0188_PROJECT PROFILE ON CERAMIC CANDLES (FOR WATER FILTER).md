## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON CERAMIC CANDLES (FOR WATER FILTER) Introduction : Ceramic candles used for water filtering and fitted inside of the steel tubler or pot for dfilter the water, and to get it bacteria free and these are made of various ceramic raw materials like china clay, Aluminia,Quarz,Feldsfar,and combustible materials. Among the two varities used (1) Candel which gives bacteria free water and (2)the other gives water free from suspended impurities. As per note of filteraion the candels are classified as domestic type and community type in which rate of filteration is 2 to 3 liters per hour and 6 to 7 per hour respectively. Interested enterpreneurs may contact MSME- DI, 111 & 112 B. T. Road, opposite ISI, Kolkata and central Glass & Ceramic Research Institue, P. O. Jadhavpur University, Kolkata,for technical Know how for manufacture candles for getting bacteria free water. 1 Name of the Product : CERAMIC CANDLES (FOR WATER FILTER) 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft rented 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 570,000.00 Ball Mill with acessaries and motor/Blunger-1000 ltr capacity with motor/Agitator cement tank capacity 1000 ltrs with accessories aand motor/ Grinding machine with motor/Electrical Drying oven 6X6X3 / Oil fired rectangular /DD kiln one tonne capacity / Plaster of paris Moulds / Office furniture and equipment / Installation of machinary and electrification.

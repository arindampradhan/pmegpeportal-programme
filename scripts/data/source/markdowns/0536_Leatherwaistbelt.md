PROJECT PROFILE of LEATHER BELTS INTRODUCTION Leather waist belt is an item of dress used by young and old. It has a functional value besides being a fashion item. The actual use of this belt is to keep the pant tight at the waist. They are made in different widths and lengths to suit customers of all age groups and build. The leather used is plain or chrome tanned cowhides of even substance in different colours and shades of mainly black and brown. The buckles used are in different attractive designs and plated. They are detachable and fitted as per customer’s choice. Leather belts are more comfortable in use and long lasting than belts made of other materials. The manufacturing process of these belts is very simple. This item can easily be fabricated by small scale/cottage scale units. MARKET POTENTIAL The demand for waist belts made of leather is increasing in domestic as well as export markets. It is popular among school-going children and youths wearing western dress. It is also popular among the other age groups of men. There is no scarcity of raw materials and skilled workers, as the same is available in abundant quantity at every place of the country. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: The term "leather belt" can be very misleading. It can be used to describe many different types of belts that vary in quality and price. All these belts look like a simple strip of leather with a buckle, but conceptual differences abound in their manufacturing process. Depending on the exact material, a leather belt can exhibit different levels of strength, durability and flexibility.

Synthetic Leather Belt: The synthetic leather contains no leather at all. It is made out of polymer that gives the appearance and feel of leather. Their manufacture is very easy, which makes them highly affordable and accessible in all sorts of colors, designs, and patterns. Faux leather belts are a good choice for those who wish to swap different belts with their wardrobe. They are not very durable, but if you do not use them often, they can last for years. Bonded Leather Belt: Bonded leather belts represent the most affordable real leather option on the market. These belts are created by pressing together leather waste scraps. The small leather fibers are glued together and treated to look like a single piece of leather. Very cost-efficient, the process results in a cheap alternative to genuine leather belts. Genuine Leather Belt: Genuine contain higher-grade leather. They may still have layers of leather scraps, but only as a fill in the middle. The outer layers are top-grain leather, which increases its strength and durability. This type of belt is considerably cheaper compared to one made solely out of top-grain leather. With a little maintenance, a real leather belt can serve its purpose for a very long time. Full Grain Leather Belt: The highest-grade leather belt, full grain leather belts are constructed out of top-grain leather, found only on the top layers of the animal's skin. This layer may contain blemishes, but that only adds to the belt's charm. In terms of durability, flexibility and strength, a full grain belt is unmatched. However, one can cost as much as several bounded leather belts. Full grain belts are a good choice for those who priorities quality over quantity. Formal or Casual: Leather belts are an essential part of men's formal clothing, and a few rules apply to choosing an appropriate one. The chosen men's formal belt should be same color, contrast, hue, and tone as the shoes. In addition, it should measure between 3 and 4.5 cm wide and 3 mm thick. Men's casual belts are not that constrictive and do not need to be leather at all. Still, many casual leather belts can be an interesting addition to your wardrobe.

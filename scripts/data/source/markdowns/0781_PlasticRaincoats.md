PLASTIC RAINCOATS Introduction: A raincoat is water resistant or water proofing coat over the cloth to prevent them getting wet. They protect our body from rain may also be in the form of may be combined with a pair of rain pants to make a rain suit. The primary material in a raincoat is fabric that has been specially treated to repel water. The fabric of many raincoats is made of a blend of two or more of the following materials; cotton, polyester, nylon, PVC, and/or rayon. The Raincoat is perfect for long-term survival in wet conditions. The quickest killer in any survival situation is hypothermia, which causes muscle fatigue and makes regular survival tasks infinitely harder. Uses & Market Potential: The raincoats are used to wear over cloth to protect the body getting wet during rain. People also wear raincoats during biking to protect the cloth getting dirty. Usually sometimes raincoats are also used in hiking and camping activities because of their temperature resistant properties where climate change or heavy rainfall is always a possibility. A rain jacket is generally combined with a pair of rain pants. Rain coats are lightweight and are useful for people during heavy rain. The trend of increasing globalization has led to increase in sale of goods in most developing economies. Advancement in product design and availability of a wide range of products is resulting in high demand for raincoats. The rain coat market can be segmented on the basis of product type, distribution channel, end-use, and geography. Based on product type, the market is bifurcated into plastic, nylon,

and vinyl. Nylon is expected to lead the market due to preference among consumers for nylon because of its comfort and affordability. Raw material: The raincoats could be manufactured by using nylon, PVC, or polyester waterproof fabric materials. The cost of each raw material decides the overall product cost. Basic raw material requirement are as follows: 1. Fabric Sheet 2. Button & chains 3. Packing material Machinery Requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: Description Set Amount PVC Welding Machine 5 325000 Button Snap Machine 1 15000 Cutting Machine 1 5000 Other equipments, dies, and hand tools Ls 200000 Total Amount 545000 Manufacturing Process: In the first step, the raw material is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. After this, the raincoat design is prepared as per the customer requirement, current market trends and specific needs. After approval from the design department the design is send to the skilled operators for the sealing and fabrication purpose. In the next step, the fabrics are cut down as per required length and width of the rain coat using cutting machine. There is an arrangement of blades in the machine that cuts the resin at desired locations. A skilled operator is required to hold and guide the fabric. After this, the PVC fabric is fed into the welding machine to weld the fabric as per the required dimension. The operator welds the two open ends of the fabric to meet the required design. This machine uses High frequency welding or Radio Frequency welding technology. Two pieces of material are placed on a table press that applies pressure to both surface areas. Dies are used to direct the welding process. When the press comes together, high

frequency waves are passed through the small area between the die or the mould and the table where the weld takes place. The high frequency or radio frequency field causes the molecules in certain materials to oscillate and get hot up to the melting point of the material. The combination of this heat under pressure causes the weld to take the shape of the die. High Frequency welding is used in a variety of industries where a strong consistent leak-proof seal is required. HF welding can only be used with materials of which the molecules allow themselves to vibrate due to the alternating electrical field, therefore PVC (polyvinylchloride) and PU (polyurethane) are the most common thermoplastics to be welded with HF. In the next step, the raincoats are quality tested. After this they are packed and dispatched as per required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

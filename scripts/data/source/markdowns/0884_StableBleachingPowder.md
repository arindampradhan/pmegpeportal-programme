STABLE BLEACHING POWDER Introduction: Stable Bleaching Powder (Calcium Hypochlorite) is a widely used chemical. It decomposes on contact with water, releasing chlorine at the point of application. This makes it a strong oxidising, bleaching and disinfecting agent. Bleaching powder is basically a bleaching agent. It finds application as a bleaching agent in Textile Mills, Hand Looms and Power Looms, Hosiery, Laundry, Paper, Soap and Silicate manufacturing and as oxidizing agent in organic synthesis. It is not for Medicinal Use. Bleaching powder also known as chlorinated lime is a yellowish-white powder easily soluble in water. The chlorine content of bleaching powder varies from 35 – 40%. If temperature of lime kept between 30°C – 40°C bleaching powder with available chlorine upto 40% is obtained. It is not hygroscopic, if kept under 40°C. It is mainly used as a bleaching agent and as a disinfectant. Uses & Market Potential: The major use of bleaching powder is in paper industry, textile industry and oil industry. It is also used in all chemical industry where bleaching is required. Disinfecting and deodorizing in food processing, beverage and sugar industries. Calcium hypochlorite is extensively used as a chlorine compound, which is highly effective against several microorganisms such as algae, bacteria, fungi, slime and other harmful and objectionable microorganisms which exist in the environment. Calcium hypochlorite is one of the most widely used bleaching, sanitation and

disinfecting agent in the world. It is an integral component of bleaching powder which also includes calcium chloride and slaked lime. The principal consumers of bleaching powder are paper industries, textile industries, oil installation, fertilizer units, tea gardens, PHE, railway, hospitals and municipal corporations. It has been estimated that the requirement of bleaching powder in entire N. E. Region is around 3500 MT per annum. Raw Material: The two main raw materials required for the manufacturing of bleaching powder are high grade lime and chlorine. Chlorine is available as a by product during the electrolysis of brine. When lime is processed with chlorine it has to be free from hydrogen to avoid explosions in the reaction chamber. The lime quality used is utmost importance. Machinery & equipments: Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Chlorinator with separator, agitator 2 750000 2. Reduction gear box 2 200000 3. Slipring motor 2 150000 4. Chain & pulley block 1 250000 5. Lime storage tank 1 100000 6. Lime storage tank 2 100000 7. Vacuum pump with motor 2 50000 Total Amount 1600000 Manufacturing Process: The process of manufacture of bleaching powder is as per Hasen Clever Process of manufacturing Bleaching Powder. In this process there are cast iron cylinders operating in series with hydrated lime and chlorine being fed counter current to each other. The cylinders are provided with rotating blades and are arranged horizontally one above the

other the rotating blades act both as mixed and conveyors of the inside mass. Hydrated lime is charged at one end of the top most cylinder while chlorine is introduced at the other end of bottom most cylinder with the rotation of the blades there is an intimate mixing of chlorine and lime with simultaneous movement of slaked lime counter current to chlorine gas. The chlorinated lime is discharged from the bottom cylinder and the un-reacted chlorine is recovered from the top cylinder and recycled along with the fresh chlorine. The bleaching powder discharged is stored in cast iron drums and wood barrels. To increase the storage life it is mixed with quick lime to yield tropical bleach containing 25% of available chlorine. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 3 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

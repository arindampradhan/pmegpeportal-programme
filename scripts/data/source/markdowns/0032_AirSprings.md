AIR SPRING MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Air springs have been used in heavy duty vehicle suspension systems and as required, nearly a century, where they have been able to provide usefulness by taking advantage of the compressed air required for vehicle braking systems. Air springs have provided a two- fold advantage over mechanical leaf- or coil-springs. One advantage with air suspension is the extra comfort provided by being able to vary the air pressure inside the spring, which changes the spring rate, and therefore, ride quality. Additionally, because variable control over air pressure adjusts the deck or trailer height, aligning loading docks to the level of the deck is possible when dock plates are unavailable. Air is directed into air springs, the bladders allow them to expand in a linear fashion, which permits them to be used as force-developing actuators, like pneumatic cylinders, and as such, rod attachments are available to mimic the function of them. Most often, however, an air actuator is simply two end plates connected by a bladder, and as they’re pressurized, force pushes the plates away from each other. Air spring are also excellent for constant force applications, such as pulley tensioners or drum roller compression devices. All air springs are single-acting, unless they are coupled together so one extends while the other retracts.

Uses & Market Potential: Air springs are widely utilized in industry and transportation. Commonly as actuators in amusement park rides, packaging equipment, clutch systems, conveyor belts and scissor lifts, they also act as vibration insulators in centrifuges, commercial laundry machines, measuring and weighing machinery, and textile looms. While the air spring has impacted many industries like oil, logging, construction and manufacturing, it is most prominent in the automobile industry where the air spring is used in suspensions for vehicle brands like Lincoln, Cadillac, Hummer, and Jeep. The global Air Springs market is valued at 2265.3 million USD in 2020 is expected to reach 2735.4 million USD by the end of 2026, growing at a CAGR of 2.7% during 2021-2026. Globally, the Air Springs industry market is concentrated by Continental, Trelleborg, Vibracoustic, Bridgestone, etc. as the manufacturing technology of Air Springs is relatively much more mature. Also, some enterprises are still well-known for the wonderful performance of their Air Springs and related services. At the same time, some countries such as Germany, Japan and USA are remarkable in the global Air Springs industry because of their market share and technology status of Air Springs. Product: Air Spring Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Air Fitting  Nut/Bolt/Mount  Bead Plate

 Bellows  Girdle  Bumper  Piston Manufacturing Process: The steps are:  First of all, twin carcass drums provide for optimum cycle time distribution between components application on one drum and dynamic stitching plus unloading by manipulator on the other drum.  After that, two dedicated beads setting and turn-up stations are connected to the carcass building station by means of automatic manipulators, travelling high speed guides.  The specially designed transfer devices pick-up the air spring carcass from the carcass drum and transfer it to the corresponding turn-up station on both sides of the system.  Positioning of the carcass inside the turn-up station is executed automatically by the manipulator, while special center lock device keeps it in position during the bead setting and turn-up operations.  The same manipulator removes the finished green air spring from the turn-up station after bead setting and mechanical turn-up operations and brings it to the unloading station on its way back to the carcass drum for picking up a new carcass.  The finished green air springs from both turn-up stations are automatically unloaded by manipulators. Material application on the drums is controlled by special cameras and sensors in automatic mode.

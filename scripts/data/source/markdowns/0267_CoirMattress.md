COIR MATTRESS INTRODUCTION Rubber backed coir products finds extensive use as flooring material. It is manufactured by hot pressing of compounded rubber based on natural, synthetic and reclaimed rubber or its blends on the back side of coir products such as mats/matting. For the preparation of Rubber backed matting mats ,coir mattings are cut into the sizes of mats and the edges are finished with all- round rubber edging or tucked back or stitched. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE Rubber and various ingredients for backing are mixed on a two roll mill and allowed to mature overnight. The compound so prepared is made into sheet of desired thickness on a mixing mill or calendar. Prepare blanks of compounded rubber sheet of size equal to that of the coir mat to be backed. The mould is heated and sprayed with a suitable mould releasing agent and the blank rubber compound sheet is kept in the mould and the coir material to be backed is placed over the blank rubber sheet. The combination is then placed in between the platens of a steam/electrically heated hydraulic press/hand fly press. It is then pressed at the appropriate temperature and pressure for the specified time. The press is opened and the product removed from the mould, cooled and trimmed. INDUSTRY LOOK OUT AND TRENDS Coir fibers are extracted from the husks surrounding the coconut. It is a common experience that fibers detached from the coconut skin are quite hard to break by simple tension, hence by pulling from both sides. Excellent properties of resistance to wear and easy availability in countries, where coconut palms are widespread, have allowed coir to be employed for a variety of uses, e.g., for manufacturing toys, bags and carpets. Coir is popularly known as the golden FIBRE. It is extracted from the fibrous husk of the coconut shell. Coconut husk is a residue from coconut production, comprising 1

approximately 30 wt. % coir fibers and 70 wt. % coir pith. It is used to manufacture a wide range of products such as ropes, mats, mattresses, baskets, brushes and brooms. Around 50 per cent of the coconut husk is used for making coir. Mixture of coir fiber and latex is steam heated, pressed and vulcanized to produce mattresses. Types & Structure of Coir Fiber There are two main types of coir fiber first is Brown Coir, from fully ripened coconut husks; strong and resistant to abrasion, it is used in brushes, floor mats, and upholstery padding and White Coir, from husks of coconuts harvested just before they ripen; softer and less strong, it is spun into yarn, used for ropes and mats. Uses and Applications A small amount is also made into twine. Pads of curled brown coir fibre, made by needle felting (a machine technique that mats the fibres together) are shaped and cut to fill mattresses and for use in erosion control on river banks and hillsides. A major proportion of brown coir pads are sprayed with rubber latex; bonds the fibers together (rubberized coir) to be used as upholstery padding for the automobile industry in Europe. The material is also used for insulation and packaging. The major use of white coir is in rope manufacture. Mats of woven coir fiber are made from the finer grades of bristle and white fiber using hand or mechanical looms. Coir is recommended as substitute for milled peat moss because it is free of bacterial and fungal spores. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: With the present growth of furniture industry and the high cost of foam rubber, there is a tremendous scope for the use of rubberized coir as a total substitute for foam rubber. For mattresses and in upholstery, it can be used in combination with foam rubber. The total production of coir around 3 lakh tons valued at Ra.1000 crores. There is a huge potential to expand coir production because only 28% of the raw material is available for production. Coir geo-textiles have been used by Konkan Railways on the rail embankments. They have been used in some of the Kerala districts road embankments in Idduki, bunds in Kuttanad, Irrigation canals in Muvatuppuzha and for hardening the marshy land in the 2

NH-bypass in Kozhikode. Driving factors for demand of rubberized coir is the present growth of furniture industry and the high cost of foam rubber for mattresses and in upholstery, it can be used in combination with foam rubber.

PROJECT PROFILE ON ‘ASSEMBLY OF ‘ALLEN SCREWS’ PRODUCT AND ITS USES: Allen Screws are a Item of fasteners used to join two or more parts of metal or other hard material. These are used to join different parts of a Die/Fixtures etc. They have a cylindrical body with uniform threads all along the length. Round Head has hexagonal cavity is made for accommodating Allen Key which is used for tightening or unscrewing these screws. For screwing in or unscrewing an Allen Key is required for the same. These Screws are used in tapped holes having matching internal thread MARKET POTENTIALITY: Due to enhancement of industrial growth, the demand for these Allen screws, which may be termed as machine screws especially for quality screws, is increasing steadily. Moreover there is one or two such unit available in the operational jurisdiction of MSME- DI, Kanpur. Hence market potential for this Item is considered to be good. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: i) The basis for calculation of production capacity on maximum capacity utilization has been taken on single shift basis for 300 days a year. During first year, second year and third year of operations the capacity utilization is 65%,70%, 75% and 80% respectively. The unit is expected to achieve full capacity utilization from the fifth year onward. ii) The salaries and wages, cost of raw materials, utilities, rents etc. are based on the prevailing rates. These cost factors are likely to vary with time and location. iii) Interest on term loan and working capital loan has been taken 11.00% per Annum. iv) The cost of machinery and equipment as indicated in the scheme are approximate of these ruling at the time of preparation of scheme. Entrepreneur may check up the latest and exact price for specific make and model of the machine selected. v) It is presumed that unit will get full capacity within fifth years. vi) It is presumed that operative period of unit will be 10 years. 2

TECHNICAL PROCESS PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE First of all coils of the required size are cleaned and fed in to the Automatic Heading machine which gives required length & head, then trimming of head to required size is done in the Automatic Machine After this threads are cut in the Auto Thread Rolling Machine Then sorting is done by hundred percent usual inspection. Then heat treatment of the Allen Screws is done as per requirement. Finally gauging and few percentage of hardness testing is done. The packing is done accordingly to size & order Summary of the production process:  Wire - Uncoiled, straightened and cut to length.  Cold forging - Molding the steel into the right shape at room temperature.  Bolt head - Progressively formed by forcing the steel into various dies at high pressure.  Threading - Threads are formed by rolling or cutting.  Heat treatment - The bolt is exposed to extreme heat to harden steel.  Surface treatment - It depends on the application. Zinc-plating is common to increase corrosion resistance.  Packing/stocking - After quality control to ensure uniformity and consistency, and packaged QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARD: The scheme envisages for manufacture of metric series Allen Screws (Socket head cap screw) M3 to M20 i.e. 2.5 mm to 17mmwrench size and generally conforming to IS:2269, IS:44762 and threads are as per IS:1367. PRODUCTION CAPACITY: The unit has capacity to produce approximately 345 Tons PA Allen Screws of assorted size and the unit has capacity to increase or decrease the quantity of each type as per orders on the unit. MOTIVE POWER: 40 HP Power will be required. POLLUTION CONTROL: No pollution is involved in the manufacturing process of Allen Screws. However proper height of chimney should be maintained in the oil fired furnace. 4

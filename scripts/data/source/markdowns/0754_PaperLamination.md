PAPER LAMINATION Introduction Lamination paper is a paper used for laminates. Normally on particle or fibreboards giving a good-looking and resistant surface for use as furniture, decoration panels and flooring. A laminate consists of a single or multiple layers, each having its own distinct function. The base is most often particle- or fibreboards, then some layers of absorbent Kraft paper. The last layers are a decor paper covered with an overlay. The lamination papers are covered with an inert resin, often melamine, which is cured to form a hard composite with the structure of paper. The laminates may also have a lining on the back side of laminating Kraft to compensate for the tension created by the top side lamination. Cheaper particle boards may have only a lining of laminating Kraft to give surface wash ability and resistance to wear. The decor paper can also be processed under heat and low/high pressure to create a melamine laminated sheet, which has several applications. Qualities of Lamination Paper 1. Lamination increases the durability of print materials, allowing them to withstand frequent use. 2. Lamination adds protection against fingerprints and smudges, stains and spills, tears and wrinkles, marks and abrasions, plus oil, grease, dirt, moisture and other contaminants. 3. Lamination improves appearance by enhancing the ink colors of the printed piece. This creates a more professional look and holds attention longer. 4. Lamination adds strength and stiffness, providing an impression of higher quality and importance. 5. Lamination is completely transparent and does not impair or blemish the printing in any way.

6. Lamination has a reasonable cost. Also, because lamination increases the longevity of print materials, it saves money on reprinting. Description of Paper Lamination Machine There are two types of machinery for Paper Lamination:  Roll to Roll sheet: It is used for lamination of paper plate, paper cup etc.  Sheet to Roll Sheet: It is used for the lamination of Sweet Box, Clothes box etc. These Machines are used to laminate the different types of paper products with the help of raw material. With the help of this machine the work of rolling, laminating completes in a very short span. Paper Lamination Market Analysis The laminating base paper is one of the crucial material for the production of aluminium laminated paper which is used as a primary packaging wrap for chocolates and other food items. Sachets & pouches is another major application of laminating base paper. Laminating base paper not only provides strength to the aluminium laminated paper but also provide a smooth surface to provide ease in printing. Direct contact of food products with chemically treated paper is not desirable as it might cause health issues to the end-consumers. Thus, laminating base paper is coated from at least one side with aluminium which makes the paper suitable for food packaging applications. As laminating base paper is primarily used for food packaging applications, huge and further expanding food packaging industry is expected to act as the primary driver for the laminating base paper market globally.

Paper Lamination Manufacturing Process  Give input for paper plate or any raw paper from one end of the machine.  After that give parallel supply of the thin film plastic to the machine from the same end.  Put the glue in the machine & roll to roll process starts.  After that the finished product is ready to kept in dies for giving different shapes. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Name Cost Roll to roll Machine 1,10,000 Sheet to roll Machine 10,00,000  Cost of the machine is exclusive of GST & value of the machine varies with the change in batch size.  This project Financials is based upon the Roll to roll machine. Land &Building required: Land required 200 Square Feet (approx.) Approximate rent for the same is 4000. Labour Requirement: 1 Manpower is required for the Paper Lamination unit. Raw Material Requirement for paper Lamination  Paper  Plastic polythene  Glue Average raw material cost per KG: Rs. 35-40

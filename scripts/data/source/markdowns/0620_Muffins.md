MUFFINS Introduction: A muffin is a chemically-leavened, batter-based bakery product. Its formulation is somewhere in between a low-ratio cake and quick bread. Muffin batter is typically deposited or placed into deep, small cup- shaped pan before baking. This gives the finished product a special “cupcake” or “mushroom-like” shape A muffin is an individual-sized, baked product. It can refer to two distinct items, a part-raised flatbread that is baked and then cooked on a griddle. A muffin is significantly heavier in texture and also in weight; with its cohesiveness, it can contain fruit, nuts or chocolate chips, which are not common in cupcakes. It need not be particularly sweet. The origin of muffins appears to be unclear and greatly depends on who and where the question is asked. The ones consumed in the UK have been traditionally known as English muffins. However, these differ from the popular muffins that are consumed in the U. S., South America and other regions of the world. Muffins have become a very popular alternative to the breakfast Danish and doughnut. They have gained acceptance as snack items in between meals, as desserts and even dinner additions.

Manufacturing process of muffins They are the meeting point between bread and cakes. As with cakes, the type of flour, baking powder and batter consistency greatly affect product characteristics. The following is a formulation process of muffins:  Scaling of the ingredients  Mixing (batter mixing using the muffin method)  Combine all dry ingredients & then Combine all liquid ingredients  Add liquids to dry ingredients and mix with the help of mixture at low speed to form a homogeneous batter.  Add inclusions and incorporate gently into batter to prevent them from breaking and releasing juices (Batter should be immediately processed to avoid loss of carbon dioxide gas that may cause poor volume in the finished product)  Put all the mixed batter into the hopper.  Start machine & the material starts come into the die with the help of filling machine in the form of drops.  After automatic filling of 2/3rd of die with material it will go to the baking section.  After baking dies are removed from the bake muffins and sent it to the packaging section.  In the packaging section, muffins flows in a horizontal line and packaging starts in small pouch.  After pouch packaging, product is ready to be sold in market.

Raw Material requirement: Basic raw material are as follows: 1. Flour 2. Milk 3. Vegetable oil 4. Sugar 5. Salt 6. Baking powder 7. Butter Paper Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1200Sqft. Civil work will cost around 5 Lac (approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and security Guard each. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and sales personal each.

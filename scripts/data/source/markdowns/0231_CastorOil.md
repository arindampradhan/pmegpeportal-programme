CASTOR OIL Introduction: Castor oil is a multi-purpose vegetable oil that people have used for thousands of years. Castor oil is colourless to very pale yellow liquid with a distinct taste and odour. Castor oil is a vegetable oil pressed from castor beans. Ricinus communis, the castor bean or castor oil plant, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the spurge family. These seeds, which are known as castor beans, contain a toxic enzyme called ricin. However, the heating process that castor oil undergoes deactivates it, allowing the oil to be used safely. Today, castor oil remains a popular natural treatment for common conditions like constipation and skin ailments and is commonly used in natural beauty products. Benefits & uses of Castor Oil:  One of the best-known medicinal uses for castor oil is as a natural laxative.  Castor oil is often used in cosmetics to promote hydration and often added to products like lotions, makeup and cleansers.

 Castor oil stimulates tissue growth so that a barrier can be formed between the wound and the environment, decreasing the risk of infection.  Ricinoleic acid, the main fatty acid found in castor oil, has impressive anti-inflammatory properties.  Castor oil has antimicrobial properties that may help fight bacterial overgrowth when applied to the skin.  Applying fats like castor oil to the hair on a regular basis helps lubricate the hair shaft, increasing flexibility and decreasing the chance of breakage Market Potential: India is one of the best producers of castor seed. India accounts for 85 per cent of the global castor seed output. The global castor oil market reached a volume of 790.5 Kilotons in 2019 & expected to touch $1,470 million by the end of 2025, growing at a CAGR of 2.8 per cent between 2019 and 2025, according to international reports. Castor oil acts as a major raw material which is used in the production of various end products such as biodiesel, polyurethane adhesives, machining oils, refrigeration lubricants, etc. This versatile nature of castor oil has been contributing towards the propelling growth of the market. Raw material: Castor beans or seeds are used as basic raw material for Castor Oil extraction plant. Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a water-soluble toxin, which is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant.

Process of extraction may be batch type or continuous. Oil Extraction process carried over the following stages to get pure castor oil; they are Extraction process, Distillation process, Separation of excess wax available in the oil. Castor Oil Extraction: The ripe seeds are allowed to dry, when they split open and discharge the seeds. These seeds are cleaned, cooked and dried prior to extraction. Oil is then extracted by pre-pressing, using a high pressure continuous screw press – called the expeller. Extracted oil is filtered. Material finally discharged from the press, called cake. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also

KVIC- REGP-Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana ELECTRO STATIC POWDER COATING Introduction : Electrostatic powder coating - process is asimple teachnique to cover metallic surfaces by coating the powder. It is superior to conventional solvent base, liquid coating (spray painting) because it contains no solvent, its performance is better, it is free from pollution and the wastage is quiteless. PROCESS AND SOURCE OF TECHNOLOGY The surface of job to be coated is prepared by processing it in pretreatment tanks thereafter the job is sprayed with the help of power coating equipment. After coating the job is taken out from booth and shifted to curing oven. The job is cured in the oven at 180 Deg. C for about 10-15 minutes. 1 Name of the Product : ELECTRO STATIC POWDER COATING 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.ft 600 Rs. 120,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 500,000.00 Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 620,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 150,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 770,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in Lakhs) Sr. No. Particulars Capcity in Quintals Rate Total Value 1 Metal Powder 240000.00 3.85 894.80 TOTAL 240000.00 3.85 894.80 4 Raw Material : Rs. 250,000.00 5 Packing Material : Rs. 10,000.00 6 Wages (3-Skilled & 3-Unskilled) : Rs. 288,000.00 7 Salaries 1 Manager R s:. 120,000.00

MANGO PULP Introduction The pulp of a citrus fruit are the stringy content of the fruit’s endocarp. The pulp contains the juice of the fruit. The pulp is usually removed from fruit juice by filtering it out. The colour of the pulp can change, depending on the species and the ripening stage. Usually, it has the colour of the fruit's peel. The juiciness of the pulp depends on the species, variety, season, and even the tree on which it grew. Mango Pulp is prepared from selected varieties of Fresh Mango Fruit. Fully matured Mangoes are harvested, quickly transported to the fruit processing plant, inspected and washed. Selected high quality fruits go to the controlled ripening chambers; Fully Ripened Mango fruits are then washed, blanched, pulped, deseeded, centrifuged, homogenized, concentrated when required, thermally processed and aseptically filled maintaining sterility. The preparation process includes cutting, de- stoning, refining and packing. In case of aseptic product the pulp is sterilized and packed in aseptic bags. The refined pulp is also packed in cans, hermetically sealed and retorted. Frozen pulp is pasteurized and deep-frozen in plate freezers. The process ensures that the natural flavour and aroma of the fruit is retained in the final product. Varieties of Mango Main varieties of Mango Pulp are Alphonso Mango Pulp, Totapari Mango Pulp, Kesar Mango Pulp. Uses of Mango Pulp  Mango pulp is widely used in preparing juices, drinks & nectars.  It is used as a base in various jams & marmalades.  It is used to make Aam ras which goes very well with puris.  Use to make delicious milkshakes which can be prepared in a jiffy.

Health benefits of Mango Pulp  Mango has high iron content, so pregnant women & people suffering from anaemia are advised to consume it regularly.  It combats acidity & improve digestion.  Mango is rich source of Vitamin A & Vitamin E which helps hormonal system function efficiently.  Selenium is also present in mangoes which provide protection against heart disease. Mango Pulp Market Analysis According to the report “Global Mango Puree outlook (2017-2026)’’ The Global Mango Puree Market is accounted for $995 million in 2017 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.7% to reach $2110 million by 2026. Some of the key factors such as mango puree widely used in making drinks, juices, jams and nectars, increasing consumption of mangoes across the globe are driving the market growth. However, due to lack of production, strict import policies especially in U. S are hindering the market growth. By nature, organic mango puree is processed from sound ripe mango rosa variety mangos, which are peeled, de-seeded, and run through a screen to retain the characteristic flavour and colour of the whole fruit. In some cases, the puree is pasteurized to increase shelf life. Fruit puree retains all the juice and a large proportion of the fibrous matter of the raw fruit.

PAPER CLIP MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A paper clip is a curved piece of wire in a certain way that is used to temporarily or permanently bond several paper sheets together. Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes. The most common material is steel or some other metal, but molded plastic is also used. Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system. Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips. The advantage of this device over others is that it practically leaves no traces and does not reliably damage the material being joined. And the sale of this type of stationery in bulk in almost every country for a year is tens of millions and billions. In the same offices, a paper clip is used not only as a fastener, but also to cover the holes in the nose of the tube with glue (clerical or PVA). This allows you to protect it from drying out, and the hole itself - from blocking it with an adhesive mass. And if, however, the nose is clogged, then with the same paper clip you can clean it and thereby avoid cutting off a fairly large part of it. A paper clip also harmoniously fits into various sockets of various household appliances and electronics.

Uses & Market Potential: A paper clip is a curved piece of wire in a certain way that is used to temporarily or permanently bond several paper sheets together. A paper clip also harmoniously fits into various sockets of various household appliances and electronics. Temporarily it can be used with a blown fuse, or as a plug for the antenna to the TV. The market potential for paper clip is vast because of the still existing paper based needs of the consumers. The global paper product market is expected to grow form INR 61,004 billion in 2020 to INR 64,502 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of about 5%. The industry growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID -19 impact, the market is expected to reach INR 78,690 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 5%. In countries such as India for instance, e-commerce portals have boosted the sales of paper products and paper pin manufactures by giving larger exposure to producers who were confined to one geography. Product: Paper Clip Raw Material: The only raw materials required for the manufacture of the Paper Clip are galvanized steel wire.

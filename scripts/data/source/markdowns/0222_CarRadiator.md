CAR RADIATOR MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A Car radiator is a heat exchanger that’s used to lower the temperature of coolant/antifreeze in the engine. Radiators contain narrow tubes that are designed to disperse heat rapidly, helping to maintain the correct operating temperature of the engine. Radiators are cooling devices used in automobiles to prevent engines from overheating. They form the heart of the cooling system in all the vehicles. They’re placed at the front of the engine where they’re fed by a flow of air, which helps with the cooling process. Primarily, they are responsible for maintaining the temperature of engines so that they can give an optimum performance. Radiators are generally fabricated from copper and brass or aluminum and comprising of numbers of pipes put in a series through which coolant circulates. However, the material of radiator depends on its use. The radiator is an invaluable part of an engine. An automobile engine burns the fuel and creates friction in the process of giving your vehicle the feed it needs. During this process, a large amount of heat is built up in the engine. The heat generated needs to be expelled in order to prevent its internal mechanics from the damage. Due to overheating, the pistons in the engine may seize up causing the engine to break down.

Uses & Market Potential: Radiators are heat exchangers used for cooling internal combustion engines, mainly in automobiles but also in piston-engine aircraft, railway locomotives, stationary generating plant or any similar use of such an engine. The government of various economies are imposing stringent regulations regarding reduction of carbon emissions from vehicles, which is projected to fuel growth of the automotive radiators market during the forecast period (2017 - 2025). The regulations such as Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) III, Tier 3, and Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) are implied to ensure least carbon emissions. Increasing inclination of consumers towards hybrid vehicles, owing to its enhanced power and fuel-efficiency is propelling demand for automotive radiators. Furthermore, hybrid vehicles require additional low temperature heat exchangers for regulated battery cooling along with normal heat exchangers. Therefore, increasing demand for additional low-temperature heat exchangers is projected to drive growth of the automotive radiators market. Product: Car Radiator Raw Material: The raw materials are mentioned below:  Copper Sheet  Brass Sheet  Tin  Lead  Other Chemicals  Packing Material

NUTMEG PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Myristica fragrans Houtt., also known in India as Jaiphal and Javitri, is a member of the Myristicaceae family. Nutmeg and mace are two spices that it makes. Mace is the fleshy red, net-like skin covering (aril) on the kernel, and nutmeg is the seed kernel inside the fruit. Nutmeg and mace are two distinct spices made from the fruit of an evergreen tree and It is a spreading aromatic evergreen tree that grows to a height of 5 to 13 meters, with a maximum height of 20 meters. The dried reticulated ‘aril' of the fruit is mace, and the dried seed kernel is nutmeg. Fruit is a fleshy drupe with a longitudinal groove in the middle, spherical in shape and light yellow in color. When the fruit ripens, it bursts open along the groove, exposing the brightly colored mace hidden underneath the nutmeg seed's hard, black, gleaming shell. On 1 cm long leaf stems, the pointed dark green leaves are borne alternately along the branches. The tops of the leaves have a gleaming sheen to them. Male and female flowers are rarely found on the same tree, and flowers are usually sexed separately. Male flowers appear in clusters of one to three, while female flowers appear in clusters of one to ten. Flowers are waxy, fleshy, and bell-shaped, and are pale yellow. Fruits with a longitudinal ridge are fleshy, drooping, yellow, smooth, and 6 to 9 cm long. The succulent yellow fruit coat splits into two valves when fully mature, exposing a purplish-brown, shiny seed (nutmeg) surrounded by a red aril (mace). Nutmeg seeds are broadly ovoid (2 to 3 cm long), hard, fleshy, whitish, and have red-brown veins running through them. The aril (mace) is bright scarlet when young, but when dry, it becomes horny, brittle, and a yellowish-brown color. The trees do not bloom until they are about 9 years old, but once they do, they continue to flower for another 75 years. The

trees produce two to three crops per year. The seeds (nutmegs) must dry for 3 to 6 weeks before they can be used. Uses & Market Potential: Nutmeg is a spice that is commonly used in Asian cuisine and is gaining popularity in other parts of the world. Nutmeg is one of the most common spices in Europe. The growing popularity of ethnic cuisines such as Indian and Thai has boosted demand for spices like nutmeg among food producers. Nutmeg is used in the garam masala used to make seasonal curry dishes by the huge Asian population, which includes India and Indonesia, who live in various parts of the world. The Indonesian group in the Netherlands, for example, is a relatively large consumer of Nutmeg in the European Union. In 2017, the Netherlands was a big nutmeg importer, accounting for nearly a quarter of all European nutmeg imports. Because of the Western community's interest in Asian cuisines, the demand for nutmeg spice is expected to grow during the forecast period. Nutmeg spice is mostly consumed in Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The

wide variety of regional dishes that use it as the main spice ingredient, as well as the long- standing, practice of using it in medicine, explain the spice's popularity. Nutmeg's main producers and export markets are Guatemala, India, and Indonesia. The nutmeg market in the area has been boosted by the development of the oleoresins industry. Spices such as nutmeg contain oleoresins, which are interesting ingredients to use in ethnic dishes for food producers. Nutmeg oleoresin is extracted in countries such as India and Sri Lanka, allowing for regional export. In both European and American communities, the demand for these extractions is high. Because of increased demand from the international community, the nutmeg market is expected to grow during the forecast period. During the forecast period, the global nutmeg market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 3.6 percent (2020-2025). Product: Nutmeg Raw Material: Ripe or mature fruit splits fruit of nutmeg which are required the husk is easily removed from the seed, while the thin and fragile mace is carefully removed. Farmers market their seeds as is or dried, with moisture content of 30-35 percent (wet basis) when harvested. Packaging material required for appropriate packaging.

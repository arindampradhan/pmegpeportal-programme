INTRODUCTION India is endowed with a largest livestock population in the world having a total bovine population of 375 million compared to the world's total bovine population of 1550 million. It accounts for 58.2% of the world’s buffalo population and 15.1% of the cattle population. Dairying is an important source of subsidiary income to small/marginal farmers and agricultural labourers. In addition to milk, the manure from animals provides a good source of organic matter for improving soil fertility and crop yields. The gobar gas from the dung is used as fuel for domestic purposes as also for running engines for drawing water from well. The surplus fodder and agricultural by-products are gainfully utilized for feeding the animals. Almost all draught power for farm operations and transportation is supplied by bullocks. Since agriculture is mostly seasonal, there is a possibility of finding employment throughout the year for many persons through dairy farming. Thus, dairy also provides employment throughout the year. The main beneficiaries of dairy programmers are small/marginal farmers and landless laborers. Buffalo farming is a profitable business & has good potential for employment generation. India has 57% of world buffalo population. Buffalo milk contributes 57% of total milk production. Buffaloes have several advantages over crossbred cows as farm animal. 1-They are well adopted to agro-climatic condition of our country 2-They are more disease resistant in comparison to crossbred cows. (Less incidence of milk fever & mastitis in buffaloes) 3-They can thrive well on crop residue 5-Buffalo milk contains more butter fat for which the price of buffalo milk is more.

About Murrah Buffalo Murrah Buffalo is a most productive water buffalo breed. Murrah buffaloes are resistant to diseases and easily adapts to south Indian climatic conditions. All these factors make Murrah Buffaloes highly suitable for professional and organized dairy farming. We are specialists in supplying high yielding Murrah Buffaloes at nominal costs.  How much milk does Murrah Buffalo give per day? A Murrah Buffalo milk yield usually ranges from 10 liters per day to 16 liters per day. There are buffaloes which yield more than 16 liters also but their price will be higher.  How much milk will Murrah buffalo give in a lactation? Murrah buffalo yield ranges in the range of 2500 to 3600 liters per lactation.  For how many days does a Murrah Buffalo give milk?

 What is the difference between a pure Murrah Buffalo and a graded Murrah Buffalo? A pure murrah buffalo is whose genetically lineage is pure - basically the buffalo has not been crossed with any other breed. A graded Murrah is a cross between a pure murrah and a local breed - graded murrah are more susceptible to local climate and resistant to disease because they inherit these characteristics from local breed but their milk yield will not be as high as a pure breed. That's why a graded murrah sells for a lesser price.  How to identify a pure Murrah Buffalo? The body of murrah buffalo is well built, heavy and wedge shaped. The head is comparatively small and face is comparatively long. Murrah buffaloes are jet black in colour. The eyes are not walled (the eye cornea should not have whiteness). The horns of a Murrah Buffalo are different from other breeds of buffaloes - they are short, tight, turning backward and upward and finally spirally curving inward. The tail is long reaching upto fetlock joint with length upto 8 inches. The legs are comparatively short but are strong built. Skin of murrah buffalo is smooth and soft with scanty hair. The udder is fully developed and drooping. The teats are equally spread over the udder and usually the hinds teats are longer than front teats. The average body of a male Murrah Buffalo is around 550 kgs and female is around 450 kgs. The average height of a male is around 1.42 meters and female is 1.32 meters.  Why is the price high if the buffalo has given birth to a female calf? If proper care is taken, a female calf will become a milk yielder in 36 to 48 months. That’s the reason their price is higher.  For how many years a Murrah buffalo give milk? Murrah buffaloes usually live for 12 years. The milk yields peaks at 4th lactation and from then on the yield reduces for each lactation.  What’s the pregnancy period of a Murrah Buffalo? Murrah buffaloes average pregnancy period is 310 days.  What will be the milk fat percentage of Murrah Buffalo? Murrah Buffalo milk fat percent ranges from 6.5% to 9%. Murrah Buffalo fat percent and SNF percent are also higher than other buffalo varieties and double than that of cow's milk.

How to start a dairy farm? Before starting: You need to have a real desire and be passionate about what you wanted to do. This is especially important for starting a dairy farm because it is very labour intensive and requires lots of patience with little support from society. Acquire Knowledge: Businesses are either inherited from parents or you work in that line and then start off on your own. But if you did not inherit or work in a farm – I suggest attend a training on dairy farming, visit both successful and failed farms and then work in a dairy farm for 1 month. By end of this exercise, you will understand if you really want to start a dairy farm. Farm Location: If you don’t already own land, it will be almost financially nonviable to start a dairy farm as the land rates are very expensive. Farm location should ideally be within 10 kms distance from a town to easily sell the milk and by-products. Dig a Bore well and get electric connections: You need a 3 phase bore well for irrigating the green grass in 1 acres and a single phase bore well for farm water use. If you have power cuts, then you need to small generator for running the single phase motor. Procure Dry Fodder: You need to procure dry fodder (vari gaddi/kutti) for up to 1 year. The quantity will depend on the quality of the dry fodder. The prices are usually cheaper after paddy/maize harvest season and it will expensive in summer months. If it is a drought year, then also the price will be higher. Milk sales tie-up: You should have already tied up with someone to directly sell the milk or give it to milk agency. Try to find a good buyer such as a hotel, sweet shop, coffee shop and direct consumers – direct selling will increase your profit. But do not supply for credit– many people tend to be very late on payments or cheat.

1. INTRODUCTION Cake Gel is mainly used by the cake manufacturer in making of cakes. It is a cake improver, comprised of emulsifiers and humectants, which greatly improves volume through increased aeration and provides a more uniform crumb structure. It also improves the softness of a cake. A cake gel is a whipping active gel, consisting of mono-layers of water and stable whipping active emulsifiers, which has crystallized in the whipping active alpha-form. Cake gel works as an emulsifier and stabilizer mix and provides standardized quality in sponge cake, cake and roll production. It is easier to make mouth-filling cakes and sponge cakes with high volume and smooth pore structure. Cake gel is basically a different variety of organic chemical mix product formed, which is largely used for the better cake preparation in sense of flavour smell and taste. It is basically substitute product of baking powder. It will give much more better-quality product than baking powder. Baking powder basically mixed product of few inorganic and organic compounds. In case of baking powder preparation there is use of tartaric acid, ammonium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate etc. In case of cake gel preparation or cake improver there is maximum chemical compound used are SSL, GMS, DETEM, glycerine, soyabean oil, D. M. water etc. Mostly chemicals are organic chemical compound. Machineries are used stainless steel made reaction kettle, heating sources quality checking equipment’s, weighing machine and packing machine.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  The use of cake gel effect on the whipping time can be shortened by 50% - 70%, greatly improving the production efficiency and shortening the production cycle.  The use of cake gel improves the stability of cake batter and the uniformity of cake pores.  Cake gel has good mechanical mixing stability and can maintain a stable cake batter proportion after a long time of mixing. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL Cake gels are semi-liquid made up of water, vegetable oil corn Flour/vanilla, emulsifiers, stabilizer, solvents, and sugar. Raw materials such as soybean oil, vanilla/corn flour, emulsifiers (GMS (glycerol mono stearate)), stabilizer (CMC) (carboxy methyl cellulose) Xanthenes gum, citric Acid, etc. are generally used as basic ingredients. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Production Process  Raw Material Procurement: Procurement is the connection process of purchasing and arranging in bound movement of all items, supplies, materials, parts, finished inventory and general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses.  Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Cake gel Manufacturing unit:

1. Making a semi liquid paste of corn flour & water: The equal amount of corn flour and water are mixed together to prepare a semi liquid paste. Corn help in maintain the white colour of the cake. Vanilla is also used in the place of Corn Flour and proper heating of paste at 80º C is required followed by cooling process. 2. Making a solution of soybean oil and citric acid: The mixing of equal amount of soybean oil and citric acid is used to form cake gel. The citric acid is a natural preservative which helps in making of bakery product as a foaming. 3. Adding of GMC and CNC on the solution: Addition of GMS and CMC in mixture act as an emulsifier and stabilizer which avoid sinking of cake provide better smooth and increase the life of bakery product. 4: Proper mixing of semi solid paste and solution: Both the semi liquid solution and mixture are required to mix together through an electric mixer. The proper mixing needed for good quality of cake gel production. 5. Packaging of the product: The proper packaging of the cake gel is required with taking care of standard hygienic parameter . 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 3000- 3500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.20000 to Rs. 30000 per month. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project.

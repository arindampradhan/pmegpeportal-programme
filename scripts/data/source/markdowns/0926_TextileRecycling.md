TEXTILE (FABRIC) RECYCLING UNIT Introduction: Textile recycling is the process by which old clothing and other textiles are recovered for reuse or material recovery. The average lifetime of a garment is estimated to be for a period of three years. After the time period, they are thrown away as old clothes. Even useful garments are discarded as they are no longer fashionable, or desirable. A report states that more than one million tons of textiles are condemned every year. Huge quantities of old clothing end up in the landfill instead of being recycled and reused. Of the house hold garbage, textiles make about 3 percent by weight. Textile wastes also arise during the process of yarn and fabric manufacture, garment making, etc. They are called as post industrial wastes. All this thrown clothing has a potential for recycling and reuse. 80 percent of the textiles that are thrown away can be recycled and used again, whereas, currently only 25 percent is being recycled. Less than 5 percent of all the garments that is thrown in the bin actually end up as waste.

Product Benefits: Textile recycling offers the following environmental benefits:  Decreases landfill space requirements, bearing in mind that synthetic fiber products do not decompose and that natural fibers may release greenhouse gases.  Avoided use of virgin fibers  Waste water reduces as it does not have to be thoroughly washed with large volumes of water as it is done for, say, raw wool.  Pressure on fresh resources too is reduced.  Reduced consumption of energy and water  Pollution avoidance Market Potential: The basis for the growing textile recycling industry is, of course, the textile industry itself. The textile industry has evolved into a $1 trillion industry globally, comprising clothing, as well as furniture and mattress material, linens, draperies, cleaning materials, leisure equipment, and many other items. The global textile recycling market grew at a CAGR of around 19% during 2014-2019 & expected to grow at a very higher rate during 2020-2025. Indian textile industry accounts for almost 24% of the world’s spindle capacity and 8% of global rotor capacity. Abundant availability of raw materials such as cotton, wool, silk and jute as well as skilled workforce have made the country a sourcing hub for textile. Raw material sources: Textiles for recycling are generated from two primary sources. These sources include:  Post-consumer, including garments, vehicle upholstery, household items and others.  Pre-consumer, including scrap created as a by-product from yarn and fabric manufacture, as well as the post-industrial scrap textiles from other industries.

Machinery Requirements: Major machinery & equipments are as follows: S No. Name Amount 1 Cotton Carding Machine Opener & Cleaner 1080000 650 MM Opener 250 MM Cleaner 2 Siemens Motor 423400 30HP Motor: 2*53500=107000 7.5 HP Motor: 5*17200=86000 5HP Motor: 2*12900=25800 3HP Motor: 2*9800=19600 Control Panel: 170000 Remote Box:15000 3 Spare part of Carding machine- Cyclone 75000 4 Hydraulic Bale press-50 Tonne Pressure 215000 5 Fabric waste cutting machine 245000 6 moving blade & 2 Fix Blade Total Amount 2038400 Net Amount (Round off) 2050000 Manufacturing Process: Fabric Recycling Process: All waste fabrics are procured form vendor and stored in raw material warehouse as per production requirement. The raw material are brought to plant and fed to the respective cutting machine. After this machine will cut the fabric into desired pieces. Then put the fabric into fiber opener, in this process fiber opener will open the fabric layer by layer & then it will go to the fabric cleaner which will clean the fabric. After Cleaning process with the help of bale press fabric is pressed to get the final product. Checking of final product, packaging & sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 3500 to 4000Sqft.

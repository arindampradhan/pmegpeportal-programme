MOSQUITO RACKET MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The racket is a device used to kill mosquitos; the user waves the racket around to catch a mosquito between the metal grid, which shorts the circuit and electrocutes the insect. It is an electronic device that produces high voltage around 300-400 volts in the nets. When the mosquito passes through the outer and inner nets of the racket, its wings short out and sparks will destroy it. This device mainly consists of control circuit board, Lead acid battery, and Metal mesh parts. Uses & Market Potential: The electric mosquito racket is a household device used widely to kill mosquitoes. This rechargeable tool can also be used to kill other insects and bugs and would be a useful tool for balconies and patios. According to the latest market study, the global electronic insect killer market is expected to reach USD 234.80 million by 2021,

growing at a CAGR of almost 7%. The rapid spread of the diseases such as the West Nile virus and the Zika virus across the globe over a period demonstrates the growing need for organized insect control devices. Insects are highly effective and deadly vectors that cause diseases in humans as well as animals. These insects spread communicable diseases like malaria, encephalitis, dengue fever, and, most recently, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The insect control activities are conducted for many reasons- economics, agricultural productivity, recreational enjoyment, and livestock health and safety. The large electronic insect killers are in major demand from the commercial sector compared with the residential sector. Mosquito killer Rackets comprise 14% of the total market for electronic insect killers. The residential sector mainly uses the rackets to do away with insects and mosquitoes. The market for rackets is in its growing stage and is expected to be dominated by the demand from the developing economies due to low product prices. The frequent charging requirements of the product hinders the market. The low coverage and success rates of killing the insect also prevent the demand for the product. Product: Mosquito Racket Raw Material: Basic raw material are ABS Plastic Granules, Electrical Components, Metal and Others (Screws, push button, solder wire, etc.)

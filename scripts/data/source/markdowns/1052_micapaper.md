MICA PAPER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Micas are a group of minerals whose outstanding physical characteristics is that individual crystals can be split into extremely thin plastic sheets while Mica Paper is a Highly Insulating material used in various applications. It is a “Paper-like” material made by the hydraulic separation process using the best quality of mica that includes Muscovite, Phlogopite, Synthetic, or Calcined Mica. It is first converted into pulp, and then pressed in the form of paper into rolls. It is mainly used in all kinds of Micanite plates and Micanite tapes. Some of the major advantages of using Mica Paper can be listed as below:  It has excellent electrical as well as thermal insulating property,  It has temperature resistance up to 1000 ⁰C.  It has good tensile strength and good air permeability.  It also has good resin penetration.  It has homogeneous distribution of granularity and structure.

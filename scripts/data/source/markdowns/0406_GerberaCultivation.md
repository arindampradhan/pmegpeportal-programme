1. INTRODUCTION The most beautiful ornament to be created by the lord himself is the flower. Even the thought of it stimulates our senses. We just can’t help feeling protective towards these tender creations of God. And amongst them the gerbera might just be rated as the magnum opus. These are from the sunflower family and are one the most common ornamental plants available. The flower centre is black in colour. It may also have petals of different colour in the same flower. It has been named after the great German naturalist Traugott gerber. Gerbera is a species of the African flowering plants’ family Asteraceae. Gerbera contains natural occurring derivatives of coumarin. Gerbera is available in many forms and in a variety of colours. They are one of the most beautiful flowers that exist on this earth. Gerberas have a long vase life; they are great flowers for adding colour to our lives. They measure around 7 inches and they can be used in landscapes as beading plants for borders and flower beds. Gerberas are flowering plants which are perennial in nature. They have a very large capitulum’s, having a two lipped florets. It has the appearance of a single flower but actually it is a hundred single flowers combined into one great entity known to laymen as the gerbera. In modern hi-tech method gerberas are grown in polyhouses. The quality of flowers produced is superior, because inside climate or micro-climate such as temperature, humidity, light, ventilation etc is controlled.

2. GERBERA CULTIVATION In modern Hi-tech method the cutflowers are grown in polyhouses. The quality of flowers produced is superior, because inside climate or micro-climate such as temperature, humidity, light, ventilation etc is controlled. Even water application is also controlled. Requirement Planting Medium Planting medium should be adequately porous and well-drained. The optimum planting, density recommended for large flowering cultivars is 8-10 plants/m2. Two –row or 4-row planting systems are generally used. Planting Time – Planting can be done round the year but preferably during September-October. The plants should be left undisturbed for 2 years for flower production (no separation of clumps). Treating plants with GA3 (100 ppm) results in early flowering having long stems. Temperature The temperature during day time should be 16-200C and 120C during nights. Cultivars Jaffa, Sangria, Rosula, Oprab, Romona, Salina, Tecora and Starlight. Harvesting The harvesting stage is critical as the flowers should not be cut before the outer row of flowers show pollen, or the flowers will wilt and close at night. Storage Optimum storage temperature (wet) for gerbera is 40C. The flowers could be stored efficiently up to 4 weeks. Yield Most modern cultivars of gerbera yield 250-300 good quality flowers/m2/year.

3. MARKETING Gerbera flowers are cultivated all over the world and are widely popular as ‘decorative’ plant. The flowers are used in making bouquets and for various decoration purposes. The flowers are very much in demand as they can last for a long period of time without losing any freshness. This is why; the flowers are widely used in weddings, parties, and functions. Marketing of cut flowers in India is very unorganized at present. In most metropolitan cities, with large market potential, flowers are brought to wholesale markets, which mostly operate in open yards. A few large flower merchants generally buy most of the produce and distribute them to local retail outlets after significant mark up. The retail florist shops also usually operate in the open on-road sides, with different flowers arranged in large buckets. In the metros, however, there are some good florist showrooms, where flowers are kept in controlled temperature conditions, with considerable attention to value added service. The government is taking various initiative to organized this sector. The government programmes for floriculture development include creating common facilities of cool chain in large production areas to be shared on cooperative basis. Formations of growers’ cooperatives/associations are being encouraged.

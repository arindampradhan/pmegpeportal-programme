REBT-10 Price : Rs. 2/- KHADI & VILLAGE INDUSTRIES COMMISSION PROJECT PROFILE FOR GRAMODYOG ROJGAR YOJANA PROJECT PROFILE ON PRODUCTION OF ENRICHED BIO- DIGESTED SLURRY UNDER REBT (BIO-TECHNOLOGY WING) The biogas technology is attributed with dual benefits in the form of supply of a clean and high calorific fuel to meet the domestic fuel needs of rural areas and provision of anaerobicaly digested slurry with high manurial value. In addition to this, it is known to reduce the pathogenic load of night soil at a substantial level when toilets are attached to the biogas plants. Hence, it is an eco-friendly technology helping to reduce the destruction of forests by offering a fuel alternative to wood at the doorstep of the house and accruing a social benefit in way of alleviation of the drudgery of women in collection of firewood and cooking. It is also an environmentally sound technology as it provides a safe method for disposal of organic waste preventing spread of diseases and controlling pollution. Consid- ering all these attributes together, the nutrient recovery through anaerobic digestion in biogas plant represents a more economic and efficient option in obtaining good quality manure for our farming system 1Name of the Product : Enriched Bio-Manure 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Building Shed 3000 sq.ft.

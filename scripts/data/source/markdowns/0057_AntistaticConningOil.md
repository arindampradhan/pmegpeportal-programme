ANTISTATIC CONNING OIL Introduction Antistatic Conning oil is also known as textile oil. Coning Oil are specially formulated antistatic conning oils. These oils are non-staining, with excellent emulsion stability used in textile industry as finishing agent, Excel Coning Oils are used for all texturizing, crimping, twisting operations for synthetic yarns. Excel Coning Oils are high refined light coloured with low viscosity mineral based products containing suitable emulsifier, antistatic friction reducing and anti-splashing agents to minimise the oil dosage during coning & twisting operation. These oils are also used for wetting & softening the yarns during rayon coning operations & woollen, rayon cording. Properties of conning oil A good Coning oil should be non-splashing. Splashing of oil during its application, especially on high speed machines, can be a safety hazard for the employees working in the plant due to slippery surface. It also results in wastage and increased cost. Coning oils should give uniform pick-up on the yarn (typically 2-5%), good filament cohesion and regular bobbin winding and unwinding tensions which are key for downstream processes. Coning oils should have good anti-static and washable, also called scouring, property. Scouring of Coning oil is done in warm to hot water having temperature between 30 deg. C to 90 deg. C with p H of between 8- 9 preferably using a detergent. Good quality Coning oils should be resistant to oxidation when exposed to air, heat or UV and should have storage life of at least one year. Criteria for selecting an appropriate conning oil  Performance (regular oil pick-up for smooth and easy unwinding, good filament cohesion and lubrication to limit

breakages and easier weaving/knitting, no oil splashing nor misting to protect machines and operators)  Compatibility (adapted chemistry to cover different raw materials, no damage caused to plastic parts and machine components, self-emulsify ability for easy removal using standard washing processes)  Compliance (free from alkylphenol ethoxylates and other SVHC of REACH regulations, compliance with specific textile standards such as Oekotex standard 100 to protect people as well as the environment, ultimately biodegradable solutions for better sustainability). Ingredients Main ingredient of Textile oil is base oil. Other essential ingredients includes Emulsifier, which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrances. Description of Antistatic conning oil Machinery for antistatic conning oil includes the following:  Mixer tank  Filler Machine These Machines are used to produce Liquid Antistatic conning oil substance from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & preparation completes in a very short span. Textile oil Market Analysis The market for anti-static oils is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.45% during the forecast period of 2019 – 2024. The major factors driving the growth of the market studied are the expanding textile industry in Asia-Pacific countries and the growing adoption of bio- based and synthetic lubricants.

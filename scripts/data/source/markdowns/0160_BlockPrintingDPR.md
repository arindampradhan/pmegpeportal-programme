BLOCK PRINTING UNIT Introduction: Block your hand Natural or vegetable dye printing is a centuries-old printing method. In India, this art style has been present for a long time, peaking in the 12th century. Today, it competes with the fast-paced world, yet it survives because people still appreciate it. A hardwood square with an etched design is referred to as a "BLOCK." This block is used to print on cloth - it's a great way to express yourself. This block is used to print on cloth, and block printing is the name for the technique. After that, the fabric is known as block print fabric. Block printing comes in a variety of styles. Below is a description of the "Dabu" printing technique. Dabu is a mud resist hand block printing method that dates back thousands of years. Hand block printing has been used for millennia in India, China, and other East Asian nations. It's also known as "block printing" or "woodblock printing." In India, a hand-carved teak wood block is soaked in dye and imprinted by hand onto cotton or silk. The end product is a genuinely one-of-a-kind, hand-block printed cloth that brings us together. As a consequence, we have a really one-of-a-kind hand block printed cloth that ties us to a long heritage of handcrafted crafts. For Passion Lillie’s fabrics, there are two main types of block printing methods: pigment dyeing, which is primarily used on white based fabrics because the dye sits on top of the fabric, and reactive dyeing, which is primarily used on dark based fabrics because the dye reacts with the fabric and changes the base colour of the fabric.

Uses & Market Potential: Woodblock printing or block printing is a technique for printing text, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later paper. The printed fabric is made using blocks in this process, as the name implies. Although the original approach always included wood, these blocks are now manufactured of wood, linoleum, or rubber. The patterns for the blocks of wood are carved by hand by artisans. Each block might take several hours, if not days, to finish, depending on the design's intricacies. After the pattern is completed, the blocks are oiled and placed away to soften. This procedure prepares it to accept colour. The worldwide printed textile market was valued at USD 146.5 billion in 2018 and is anticipated to grow at an annual rate of 8.9% over the next five years. In Asia Pacific and the Middle East, shifting consumer attitudes regarding the adoption of printed textiles are expected to have a favourable influence on market growth. Printed textiles have a stronger colour connection to the fibres, making them more resistant to friction and washing. Furthermore, growing consumer disposable income in emerging nations such as China, India, and Brazil are expected to boost printed clothing consumption, therefore supporting market development.

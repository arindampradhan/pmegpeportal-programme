WOODEN TOY MAKING UNIT   2. Introduction: An artisan cluster is defined as geographically concentrated (mostly in villages/townships) household units producing handicraft/handloom products. In a typical cluster, such producers often belong to a traditional community, producing the long-established products for generations. Indeed, many artisan clusters are centuries old Artisan. The mountains, river and lush green landscape lend a special charm to Chitrakoot, which means hills of many wonders. Chitrakoot is known for its wooden handicraft, toys in particular. Making of wooden handicraft is an age-old tradition in this small town, located in the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, about 280 km from Allahabad and 92 km from Satna.

The jungles of Chitrakoot supply Dudhi Sundari and Koraiya woods, with which the handicrafts are made. The tapping, sawing and drilling sounds associated with woodwork that rang through the village has diminished much. Making and selling of the handicraft that sustained more than 200 families earlier lacks patronage now, due to urbanization and better appeal of modern toys. The area has sensible business openings for the informed since there are two government colleges and a couple of schools. In any case, craftsmans' vocation has been influenced because of fall popular. From 200-odd families making and selling Chitrakoot toys and craftsmanship, the quantity of families who rely entirely upon this fine art to support themselves has come down to around 30. 3. Market Potential: The softwood lacquer ware toy business is on verge of closure due to government apathy, stringent export norms and rising input costs. The European Union, Australia and the US demand for certifications and eco- friendly compliance markings on this craft. With urbanization, housing needs

have led to lack of open spaces for craftsmen to set up temporary stalls during tourist season and festivals. They manage to sell the handicraft items through local exhibitions for their livelihood. Chitrakoot district has a distinct place in the country in wood craft. A well mixture of traditional way and modernity done and craftsmen of the district added new horizons to this art. Right from furniture to daily useable items are manufactured from wood in this district. You will witness a new pattern of wooden carving here. Not only toys but items to be used in building construction like door and window frames are manufactured and exported to other states. 4. Product Description: 4.1. Product Uses- Toys, similar to play itself, fill different needs in the two people and creatures. They give amusement while satisfying an instructive job. 4.2. Raw Material- The industry is totally dependent on forests for the primary raw materials. These forest-based products are the wood of the hale tree (or other species like- teak, oak, ebony, redwood, rosewood, red cedar, pine, etc.), lac produced by the insect Technadria lacca and the leaves of the talegiri (Pandanus odoratissimus).  Synthetic materials used are paints and pigments.  Lithophone (compound of barium sulphate and zinc sulphide) is used to give opaqueness to the lac. Average raw material cost per toy considering various sizes will be Rs. 100-120 (Approx.)

4.3. Manufacturing Process: The process of wire inlay involves a lot of steps. Following are the major heads under which the product can be classified: The manual lathe (pattari) consists of a rectangular block of wood (2" x 4" x 18") fixed into the ground and attached in a T-joint to another similar sized piece of wood with a cross section 3" x 1". The wood is rotated with the help of a bamboo/cane bowshaped tool about four feet in length. This bowshaped tool is topped with a round wooden kit on which the thread or rope is twined. It has a hole in it to permit the reed or rope to pass through it. The bow is held with the rope tight, the rope going around the wooden kit to enable it to rotate. Production of a wooden lacquer articles involves the following key processes:  Lacquer Preparation:  Heating- Lac is fixed on finishes of wooden sticks and warmed to make it plastic and flexible. The cycle might be repeated.  Beating- Lithophone is then beaten with the lac till a white tint appears.  Dyeing- powdered dye mixed with water is then added to the warm lac and beaten again to reach a rubber like consistency.  Prepared lacquer- Reheating is followed by removal of the lac from wood to form sticks 0.5cm thick, 3cm wide and 15-20 cm long. 4- 5 sticks of one color and a shelf life of one month are prepared at a time. Wax may be added by boiling with the lacquer to add a glossy finish.

 Wood Preparation:  Cutting-Seasoning Cutting the wood into smaller pieces. Storing them away from heat and sunlight but in good air circulation for about 10-30 days.  Chiseling- Chiseling the wood to form cylinders.  Shaping into articles- The wood is turned on a manual/electric lathe and a chisel is used to scrape off continuous chips till desired shape is achieved. The lathe can create only basic shapes oval, conical or round.  Smoothening- Shaping is followed by smoothening the surface using sandpaper  Coloring- Coloring skill defines the quality of the final product. Coloring of the wood is carried out from lac sticks. The stick is touched to the surface of the wood. The continuous revolving of the wood on the lathe causes friction between the lac and the wood which melts the lac and it spreads on the wood.  Finishing:  Polishing-Buffing- A screw pine leaf further spreads lac on the wood which is followed by polishing and buffing (for translucency). Kewda oil may be used for polishing.  Separating from lathe- A cutting tool is used to separate the wood from the lathe.  Painting- Paint may be used for final finishing

ELECTRIC TOASTER Introduction: Electric toaster as the name suggest is essentially a portable domestic appliance intended for toasting bread and is operated electrically. The bread is inserted in the toaster, heated at desired temperature till brown in colour and a reasonable texture. That is the duration of the toasting period is predetermined by setting of built in control device. It is useful to domestic household as well as restaurants and hotels etc. The advantages are, it saves labour and time, easy maintenance, keeps kitchen clean and tidy. Electrical energy flows into the toaster from a wire plugged into the domestic electricity supply. The electric current flows through a series of thin filaments connected together but spaced widely enough apart to toast the whole bread surface. The filaments are so thin that they glow red hot when the electricity flows through them. Like a series of small radiators, the filaments beam heat toward the bread in the toaster. The steady supply of heat rapidly cooks the bread. There are filaments on each wall of the toaster so the two sides of the bread cook at the same time. Uses & Market Potential: A toaster, or a toast maker, is an electric small appliance designed to brown sliced bread by exposing it to radiant heat, thus converting it into toast. The global toaster market size is expected to reach USD 4.5 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., registering a 4.8% CAGR during the forecast period. The market is mainly

driven by increasing demand from quick service restaurants. This is one of the best labor-saving appliances used across homes, hotels, cafes, and restaurants. Technological advancements in the appliance over years have significantly benefited market growth. Manufacturers are constantly looking to innovate new and versatile appliances that can fit into different spaces, have various capabilities and sizes, and offer varied heating specifications that can range from simplistic to extreme, depending on how one prefers their bread. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Aluminium Sheets 2. PVC Pellets 3. Mica Heating Element 4. Thermostat 5. Slice Pop-up Toaster Circuit Board 6. Electric Cord 7.

Manufacturing Process: At first, the raw material is procured from the authorized local vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the design for the toaster assembly is prepared and approved by the design department. The stainless steel sheets are procured from the inventory and dipped in acid tank to remove any dust, rust and harmful elements for pickling. After this, the cleaned sheets are fed into shearing machine that cuts the sheet along its length as per the product dimensions. The sheets are cut with allowable tolerances for folding and bending operations. After this, the aluminium sheets are fed into punching machine to form the desired holes and cavity as required in design. The punching machine has an assembly of punch and die of desired shape to cut the sheets as per requirement. In the next step, the sheets are fed into the bending machine to roll and bend the sheet with desired profile. The bending operation gives the sheets folded box structure that acts as heating space for the tandoor. After bending and folding of sheets, they are joined at the corners using arc welding machine. The arc of welding raises the temperature of the sheet to melt down which forms welded joint. In the next step, excess materials, uneven weld surfaces are cleaned using portable hand grinder. After this, the mica heating element, circuit board are precisely mounted and assembled in the toaster using wires. After this, the plastic out casing body of electric toaster are manufactured in injection moulding machine. The PVC pellets are fed into the hopper of the machine. The profile dies are mounted precisely into the machine. The plastic cage is over-moulded in steel case. After this, the barrel heater are started and brought up to the desired temperature. The plastics gets melt down and the screw presses the molten plastic into die. After cooling with suitable cycle time the solidified pieces are gets separated out using ejector pins. In the next step, the electric cord and thermostat are assembled into the toaster. Bakelite handles are mounted at the surfaces of sheets using riveted screws using stud welding machine. In the next step, quality testing of the assembly unit is performed for satisfactory performance. After this, the Electric irons are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff

facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require.  NOC from State Pollution Control Board

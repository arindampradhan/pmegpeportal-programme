COMPOSTABLE STARCH BAG Introduction Compostable Liners and Bags are the essential waste diversion product for home, business, or zero-waste event and are made with renewable resources. In typical parlance, the word compostable is distinct in meaning from biodegradable. While biodegradable simply means an object is capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms, "compostable" in the plastic industry is defined as able to decompose in aerobic environments that are maintained under specific controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Compostable means capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials. Advantages of Compostable Starch Bag Unlike standard plastic bags, and even some biodegradable plastic bags, compostable bags are made of vegetable matter, such as sugar starch. When exposed to enough moisture, the bags will compost, right along with whatever was placed inside them. Standard biodegradable bags may just break down into smaller and smaller pieces of plastic. While this is better for the environment than a regular plastic bag, and biodegradable bags will never wind up in the ocean in a large piece, they can still contaminate the environment with plastic chemicals.

Benefits:  Easily accessible  Certified to be compostable  Thick bag unlikely to split when carried short distances  Fits into standard sized trash cans  Breaks down well with moisture  Made from renewable plant resources Compostable Starch Bag Market Analysis With a population of 1.252 billion, Indian economy is one of the fastest growing economies of the world and a founding member of SAARC and G4 nations. Some of the largest cities in India are Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, and Kolkata. The country have low per capita income of USD 1165 and USD 5238 in PPP terms. Compostable Plastic Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% by 2020. However, technological advancement and increasing demand from different sectors such as automobiles, packaging, healthcare, retail and agriculture, will lead to robust demand in Indian Compostable Starch Bags industry by 2020. Various regulation laid down by government and growing concern for environment will lead to increasing demand for biodegradable plastic in coming years. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machinery are required for Compostable Starch Bag manufacturing process:  Extrusion Machine: It is the main machinery which converts small granules into long sheets.  Cutting Machine: This cuts the sheets into different sizes.  Printing Machine: The printing machine prints logos, brands or trademarks as required.  Packaging Machine: The printed bags are finally packed into carry bags of different sizes by this machine.

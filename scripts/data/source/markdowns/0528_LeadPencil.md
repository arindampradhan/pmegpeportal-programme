Introduction A pencil is a writing implement or art medium constructed of a narrow, solid pigment core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being broken and/or from leaving marks on the user’s hand during use. Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving behind a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which instead disperse a trail of liquid or gel ink that stains the light colour of the paper by absorption. Most pencil cores are made of graphite mixed with a clay binder which leaves grey or black marks that can be easily erased. Graphite pencils are used for both writing and drawing and result in durable markings: though writing is easily removable with an eraser, it is otherwise resistant to moisture, most chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, and natural aging. Other types of pencil core are less widely used, such as charcoal pencils, which are mainly used by artists for drawing and sketching. The most common type of pencil casing is of thin wood, usually hexagonal in section but sometimes cylindrical, permanently bonded to the core. Similar permanent casings may be constructed of other materials such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not permanently bonded to the core. Instead, the casing supports a separate, mobile piece of pigment core that can be extended or retracted through the casing tip as needed; these pencil casings can be re‐loaded with a new core (usually graphite) when necessary.

Market Potential Wooden pencil or lead pencil is an essential item for students and artists. Generally, HB and 2B pencils have popularity in the Indian market. Even in the recent era of computers, printers, tablets, cell phones and a whole host of other writing and drawing instruments, pencil industry is growing. There is a growing demand of wooden pencil in the market. The products find application in schools, colleges, government offices, commercial establishments, NGOs and miscellaneous activities. According to the type of carbon used, pencils are classified as soft, medium and hard. There is no doubt about the acceptability of the product and lead pencils still command a respectful demand. The product has a good export potential also. According to the different grades, there is a variety of HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8B, 9B, and 10B. Writing, drawing, sketching, coloring and shading are the basic applications of the wooden pencil. The ever increasing population of the country and requirement of quality products are the major reason for the growth of this evergreen business. There is sufficient market for the pencil to justify the establishment of a wooden pencil manufacturing plant in India.

Economics Of Pencil Making Just as with any other manufactured products, the economics of pencil manufacturing are driven by a number of factors. These cost drivers include:  cost of raw materials (wood, graphite, clay, brass or aluminum for ferrules, lacquer components, etc.)  cost of parts or other finished components used to assemble the pencil  cost of transportation and handling of various materials used and of the finished product to the factory  cost of labor and benefits for the factory workers employees  cost of energy  cost of supplies used to maintain equipment  cost of government regulations (taxes, duties, compliance to safety, labor or environmental rules)  cost of capital (money used to buy equipment, to purchase and maintain inventories of raw materials, parts, supplies and finished product)  cost of management Pencil companies make a number of important decisions regarding these costs as part of their business. Some of the most important decisions include:  the quality of product they wish to produce will impact which raw materials and component parts they will purchase  alternative suppliers for raw materials  whether to make internally or buy externally different component parts like slats, leads, ferrules and erasers or even semi‐finished pencils from other pencil manufacturers where to locate their pencil factories which is driven by relative difference in costs between cities, states or countries for labor and materials, transportation costs for incoming materials as well as to the customer, regulatory and energy cost as well as duties and taxes  the quantity of product to produce drives the level of investment required in the factory and inventories as well as can effect the cost per unit produced due to economies of scale.

The pencil manufacturer strives to minimize the cost of producing the pencils at the desired quality level and quantity of production and to sell all these pencils for more than the cost in order to achieve a profit. All of these decisions are made within the framework of the marketplace and the competition the pencil maker faces for business from the other producers. The level of competition can have a big impact on the profit in an industry or segment of the pencil market. Each company tries to focus on what competitive advantage it has versus other pencil makers and what it can do better than others. This is why different companies specialize only in certain markets or product ranges to try to set them apart. These days, typical yellow writing pencils and children’s coloring pencils are generally considered to be a commodity. That is, one product from one producer is more or less considered by the customer to be as good as another, just like corn from one farm is more or less the same as corn from another farm. When this occurs the price often becomes the key purchase factor for the pencils. Then it is more difficult to make a profit without a strong brand name or other point of difference in terms of product feature or performance. A key factor that effects the competition is the increasing level of international trade. As more markets have opened up to more producers from more countries around the world the pencil industry like many others has globalized. Many poorer countries such as China, Indonesia and India have dramatically increased pencils production and export because of a general cost advantage in materials, labor and reduced regulatory environments.

TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING A. TECHNOLOGY 1. Process Description The pencil making plant consists of the following processes: making uncoated pencils, lacquering, stamping, attaching of eraser, final treatment, and packing. a) Wood working process The pencil slat is shaved in to fixed size, and a semicircular groove is made on the surface with the grooving machine. The grooved slat, which is half a pencil, is coated with glue and the leads are placed in the groove and then covered with the second slat. The resulting block is tightened with iron frames and dried in a drying chamber. The dried block is passed through a shaping machine that shapes the raw pencil. b) Lacquering Process The raw pencils are then lacquered in a painting machine, which is made to apply three to ten times of lacquer coating depending on the quality of finish required. c) Final Treatment: After the final coat of lacquer, the pencils are placed in heading and sizing machine which sands off excess wood and paint from the ends of the pencils and trims the pencils to their exact finished length. The tipping process for making eraser tipped pencil consists of several steps. First, the pencils are sent to rounding‐off and sharpening machine . The ferrule and the eraser are fitted to the pencil and, with the aid of punching device, steel needles are plunged through the ferrule to pierce the ferrule to both pencil and eraser. The manufacturer's brand name, the hardiness number of lead, and any other required information is imprinted on the pencil by means a stamping machine.

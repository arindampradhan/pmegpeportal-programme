1. INTRODUCTION Friction is the force that opposes movement on two surfaces. At the same time, wear is that change that takes place on a surface due to the removal of abrasive debris as a result of mechanical contact and a chemical-physical nature due to the heat generated by friction. A lubricant is a substance that helps to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move. It may also have the function of transmitting forces, transporting foreign particles, or heating or cooling the surfaces. It is also called penetrating oil, most oil spray lubricants are made from crude oil, but some are made from vegetable oil. Their low surface tension makes them best for penetrating deep into mechanisms and into the threads of rusted bolts and nuts. After spreading lubricant goes on thick and stays where you spray, making it ideal for use on vertical surfaces and offers non-fling for moving parts such as gears, bearings, cables, chains, rollers, and more. Once applied, it withstands temperatures ranging from -100°F to 500°F. Spray Lubricant provides high-performance lubrication and corrosion protection, in a quick-drying no-mess formula. It's safe for use on metal, rubber, vinyl, wood, and much more. Lubricant sprays are used for Doors, locks, hinges, belts, windows, latches, zippers, switches,

fishing equipment, tools, chains, belts, sports equipment, lawn equipment, valves, linkages, pulleys, fans, and more. Most silicone sprays contain just around 1.5% silicone grease. The upside of silicone spray is that it repulses water and performs well in outrageous temperatures. Thin and clear, it's likewise great when tidiness counts. Notwithstanding metal, silicone is often safe to use on rubber, wood, nylon, vinyl, and plastic parts. Silicone ought not to be utilized where pressure or load-bearing is involved. Dry spray lubricants are mostly graphite. Their solvents evaporate rapidly. Dry lubricants are good for interior hinges, interior locks, drawer slides, and toolbox drawers. The primary benefits of dry lubricants are that there is no oily mess and that dust and dirt don’t stick to them. Dry lubricants don't dislodge water, and they wear off decently fast under load, making it important to reapply them more oftentimes than other lubricants. Lithium grease is a combination of lithium hydroxide and oils; lithium grease is great for metal-to-metal contact, particularly when pressure or a weighty load is involved. It works incredibly in spots, for example, the table saw wrenches and the metal hinges on garage doors. 2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The user sectors of Lubricant sprays are industries for home appliances etc. Lubricant sprays are used for lubricating car door hinges, locks and levers, seatbelts and seatbelt guides, rubber seals and parts, sunroof rails, seat tracks, and other moving parts, lubricating and protecting blades, knives, dies, and cutting surfaces. Leather gear can also be softened with a spray lubricant. Many manual tools with moving parts (pruning snips) can be lubricated to increase tool life and ease of use. Lubricant spray also helps protect these tools from rust and corrosion. Spraying the sliding door tracks with silicone help keep the door moving easily and smoothly. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- Raw material procurement Production Process Testing

## Page 5

Raw Material Procurement To ensure complete quality control, all raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. After quality control, sorting of raw material will be done. In the sorting procedure, the different types of materials will be sorted out and they will be stored in a neat storage area for further processing. Production process 1) Chemical formulation: The formulation of a lubricant is made up of base oils and additives, which, when combined, determine the behavior of the mixture during product use, both in terms of performance and durability. Each lubricant has a different set of characteristics based on its formulation during manufacturing that determines its consistency, viscosity, ability to prevent friction, reduce wear and tear, protect against rust, corrosion, and oxidation, maintain mobility, and stop water and other contaminants from coming into contact with the equipment. For lithium grease lubricant; lithium hydroxide and oils are mixed. lithium grease is ideal for metal-to-metal contact, especially when pressure or a heavy load is involved. For silicon lubricant, silicon solvent and oil can be mixed. For dry lubricant, graphite can be used.

2) Liquid filling: The empty containers or aluminum cans travel along the production line and bespoke the formulated stored liquid and added to the can. With liquid filling machines, liquids can be easily and efficiently packed into containers without much wastage, and that is too faster. In this method penetrating oils can be filled in cans. This process is done by a liquid filling machine which can accomplish the huge liquid filling tasks in industries very easily and fast therefore can replace the work of many human beings who were to do the process in absence of these machines. 3) Valve inserting, Sealing/crimping, and Gas filling: The valve is then fitted to the can. The turntable will choose valves automatically. Under the airpower, the valves will be placed and pressed on the can tightly and then the crimping is done. Crimping is a conjoining of two pieces of metal fitting with sections of rigid, flexible hose and tubing by deforming one or both of them to hold each other and stick together. Then the machine will inject propellant, under pressure, through the valve. Propellent may be in the form of petroleum gas or compressed gas. Gas will be filled in cans with a gas filling machine. Once filled, the cans are sent for testing.

4) Water bath QC: The classic test for checking the integrity of lubricant spray is the hot water bath, where filled cans are immersed in water to verify if bubbles escape from the containers. Instead of a water bath test, some manufacturers can also use a pressure tester. 5. Weight checking: Once tested for leaks, in this process weight of each can is checked to ensure the correct fill. This is checked with the automatic weighing machine.

6. Spray head/nozzle pressing: In this step, the spray head or nozzle is pressed with a nozzle pressing machine. After the actuator/nozzle is fitted, the date and the batch code will be printed to ensure full traceability before the cap is applied. 7. Capping: After labeling, Capping is done and the product will be sent for packing.

Testing  Quality Control: Leak testing, weight testing, etc. will be tested. 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.20,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1000 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 500 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sqft.

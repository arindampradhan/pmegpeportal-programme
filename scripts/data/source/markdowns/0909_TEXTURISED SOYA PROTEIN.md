## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai TEXTURISED SOYA PROTEIN Introduction : Soyabeans are rich in proteins and are becoming popular day-by-day. States like MP,UP, Maharashtra, Gujarat etc. are producing substantial quantities with MP being the largest producer. Bulk of the soyabeans are processed by solvent extraction plants for oil leaving large quantities of defatted soya flakes. These flakes or deoiled soya cake can be converted into nuggets or chunks by extrusion. Hence the project should be preferably located close to the souyabean extraction plants. Process of Manufacture: It is imperative to have good quality solvent extracted flour for processing with the Nitrogen solubility index in the range of 45% to 50%. Other parametrs are 7.5 to 8.5% moisture, 53 to 54% proteins,less than 10% fat, 2 to 3 % fiber and yellow to light brown colour. Extracted flour with these characteristics is suitable for extrusion. Extrusion technology is based on high temperature short time processing. Rice and Baking powder in a small quantity are mixed with the deoiled soya flour or cake. The chunks are dried after extrusion. The chunks can also be converted into flakes or granules.

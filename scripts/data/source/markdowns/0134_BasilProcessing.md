BASIL LEAVES PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Basil belongs to the mint tribe. The most popular culinary basil is sweet basil. Basils have square, spreading branches, opposite leaves, brown or black seeds, and flower spikes as physical characteristics. Basils with large leaves, such as sweet basil, Italian basil, and lettuce-leaf basil, can reach a height of two to three feet. Basil with small leaves, such as lemon basil, dwarf basil, bush basil, or spicy globe basil, can achieve a height and width of 8 to 12 inches. Dark Opal and Purple Ruffles, for example, are reddish-purple varieties with purple flowers rather than white flowers. Despite slight taste differences, these varieties are used in food processing. When all danger of frost has gone, basil can be immediately seeded or transplanted to the field in late spring. Plants are arranged every six inches in rows 25 to 35 inches apart. Basil may also be planted in three-line rows in raised beds. Basil is sensitive to drought and needs constant watering. Drip irrigation is preferable because it reduces the amount of moisture that comes into contact with the trees, which causes damage to the vegetation. The soil type, recent fertiliser applications, and previous crop type all influence how much basil needs to be fertilised. A nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertiliser is recommended in general. Fertilizer can be scattered over a field and ploughed in, or it can be added in between the rows of a growing crop through a process known as "side dressing." Herbicides are normally not used until plant emergence as basil is cultivated commercially. For weed control, farmers rely on mechanical planting, high plant populations, mulch, and manual weed removal.

Uses & Market Potential: Basil comes in over 60 different varieties, some of which are red or purple in colour, and each has its own distinct taste. Sweet basil is the most common and widely available variety, with many varieties to choose from. Because of its anise-like scent, Thai basil is used in many recipes. The purple stems and robust leaves differentiate it from sweet basil. Lemon basil, cinnamon basil, and spicy bush basil are examples of varieties named for the way they smell or taste. A large number of companies involved in the production of essential oils can be found in Europe and North America. As a result of this, the basil leaves market is expected to see massive demand from these regions in the coming years. Basil is an annual or perennial herb that is grown for its leaves. Basil is classified as an ultra-niche and high-value crop due to its common success as a medicinal plant with significant health benefits. In recent years, North America has been the world's largest manufacturer of basil leaves. In 2019, the Asia Pacific industry accounted for 37.87 percent of the overall market, while Europe and North America accounted for 4.35 percent and 51.23 percent, respectively. The main suppliers in the global Basil Leaves industry include Mc Cormick, Litehouse, Fresh Origins, Frontier Natural Products, Herbs Egypt, and others. The global Basil Leaves demand is forecast to rise at a CAGR of 1.3 percent between 2021 and 2026, from USD 57 million in 2020 to USD 62 million in 2026.

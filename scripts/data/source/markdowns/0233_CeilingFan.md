1. INTRODUCTION A ceiling fan is a mechanical fan mounted on the ceiling of a room or space, usually electrically powered, that uses hub-mounted rotating blades to circulate air. It’s used for conventional cooling. They only introduce movement to the air through their rotating paddles or blades. Most ceiling fan consist of components such as blades, electric motor, switch housing or electrical connections, downrod, canopy etc. Some ceiling fans have curved blades. In this case, flipping blades upside-down when possible would make fans more effective on updraft, because when the blades are left right side up, they might not blow nearly as much air on updraft, especially on industrial ceiling fans. Ceiling fans are an especially economic choice in warm, humid environments. Ceiling fans can be operate in different ways. Some come with a pull-chain or pull-cord control. Some fans operate on a variable-speed control where a dial, which works like a dimmer switch, is mounted on the fan. Some fans have their controls mounted on the wall, while others come with wireless remote controls that transmit radio frequencies or infrared control signals to the receiver installed in the fan.

This process can be broken down into following steps: 1. Raw material procurement 2. Design 3. Injection moulding- Plastic moulding 4. Metal parts fabrication- Blades, Stator, Rotor, Shafts, Downrods, Motor cover etc. 5. Stator winding 6. Assembly 7. Testing Raw material procurement After importing required raw material; quality checking, sorting will be done. Chemical Analysis, Physical Testing, Pressure Test & Leak Checking, Electronic Dimensional Checking of metal raw material will be done. The quantity of raw materials being handled and it will store it in store department or in raw material inventory. Quality control of raw material is the maintaining of all the procedures that are needed to be taken to produce a quality full product. In sorting procedure the different types of materials or parts will be sorted out like plastic, metals, electrical components etc. It will be separated and material will be stored and later on it will dispatch to assembly line. Design To effectively develop a product design specification for the fan, need to know customer need, trending designs, demand of the product and the basic function of the fan. The basic function of a fan is to cause effective air flow in a room and this should be accomplished for a long usage of several years at varying rotations per minute. The quality of fans is rated by their performance which is in moving the air effectively and quietly. This is monitored by such factors as the length, pitch, and number of ceiling fan blades, and their revolutions per minute (rpms). The angular edges of the fan blades are also known as the pitches which are especially significant for the effective movement of the air. The shape empowers the blade to apply strain to the air before it and in this manner the air is constrained

downwards. Design of blades is such that blades are sloped in direction of rotation, anticlockwise. Blade lengths for most of the fans are standard 48 inch, 24 inch etc. The most widely used materials for making ceiling fan blades are Wood, Plastic and Metal. Some manufacturers are providing customizable fan designs as per consumer’s house interior design to making interior both look and feel cool. Some ceiling fan designs are shown below: Injection moulding- Plastic moulding The plastic parts for ceiling fan are be made from plastic granules. Firstly granules are fed via hopper into a heated barrel. Where the plastic will be melted at set temperature. The melted plastic is then injected through a nozzle into a mould cavity where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity and the formed plastic parts will be ejected out. Canopy, Capacitor clamp will be formed using this process. Canopy is used to cover the capacitor wiring and wiring between the ceiling and the fan. Manufacturers can also form fan blades, designs accessories for fan blades or fan body, plastic ring etc. parts using injection moulding. Metal parts fabrication i. Blades- Blade making process contains process such as sheet cutting, punching, Blade angle setting, and Blade shank riveting, Painting etc. Shearing of a steel sheet

will be done. Then bending or twisting of the blades will be done with respect to a mid-plane of the blank to give the desired amount of twist. Here blade angle setting will be done using bending machine. For blade shank forming metal sheet will be casted using punch press machine. Further blade shank riveting will be done. Blades will dispatch for painting section where blades will be painted in desired shades. Before painting these parts pickling process will be done which is used to remove rust, impurities, and scale from the surface of formed metal parts. ii. Stator and Rotor manufacturing- To form stator core, sheet lamination is used to form a laminated core instead of a solid piece to reduce eddy current losses. A cold rolled non grain oriented electrical steel strips is fed into a reciprocating stamping press with progressive stamping dies to form strips for laminated stator core. The die moves with the press, and when the press moves down the die closes to stamp the metal part. Stator core is the steel part consisting of thin steel sheets (laminations) stacked

together; usually with a thickness of about 0.5 millimetre. The laminations are bonded in order to create a stable core. Interlocking, Clamping, Welding, Bonding are some techniques to join the steel lamination stacks. Rotor can be formed using similar process.  Welding technique- The laminations/lamellas are stacked loosely and subsequently joined with a weld seam using welding machine.  Interlocking technique- Stamping and interlocking will be performed by a high speed lamination stamping machine with the interlocking die system. The metal will punched and then laminated. The progressive die stamps has several interlocking points on the lamination, just like a stake, which is concave in the upper surface and convex in the lower side. When the convexity of one lamination is pressed to the concavity of the previously stamped lamination in the stamping-out process, the upper and the lower laminations are staked and fastened. When the required number of laminations will fastened, they will be separated with a pierced lamination. In this way, by progressive stamping of the high-speed stamping press, we will get a lamination stack in a determinate thickness, with all laminations closely arranged together and burrs in the same direction.

v. Motor cover manufacturing- Die casting Motor covers of ceiling fan will be formed with die casting process. Iron will be melted in induction furnace with required amounts of iron metal. Contaminants are removed from the melted iron, and the iron, once melted, is then cast. Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mould thus giving it a shape; shape of fan cover or motor casing. The melted-liquid iron will be filled in mould and will be allowed to set into moulds/slabs for solidification. Later cooling will be done. And formed parts will be ejected out. Further formed metal parts polishing and panting will be done. For painting these formed parts either liquid paint or powder coating will be used. Manufacturers can also form rotor part using die casting process. Stator winding Ceiling fan stator winding can be broken down into three steps: paper insertion process, winding process, stator impregnation varnish dripping process. Paper insertion and stator winding are be done 2 times for inner and outer slots respectively. This process machines are automated, only manual loading and unloading the ceiling fan motor stator, which significantly improves production efficiency and saves production costs. Firstly, inserting the insulation paper into the inner ring of the stator will be done, and then the coil winding of the inner ring of the stator will be completed. Further inserting the insulation paper into the outer ring of the stator will be done and the coil winding will be done for the same. After the ceiling fan motor stator winding, the fan stator fan starts the impregnation varnish dripping, help the enamelled wire of the stator can be fixed, so that the coil is not loose and the wire is not twisted, the friction between the wire and the wire is reduced, and the insulation performance of the stator can be increased. Besides, varnishing process of stator; stator buffing can also be done.

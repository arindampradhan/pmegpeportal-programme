PLASTIC INJECTION MOLDING Introduction: Injection molding is a manufacturing process for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mould. Injection moulding can be performed with a host of materials mainly including metals (for which the process is called die-casting), glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly the thermoplastic and thermo setting polymers. Injection molding is used to create many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, automotive parts and components, toys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), onepiece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. Injection moulding is the most common modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object. Injection molding machine molds can be fastened in either a horizontal or vertical position. The majority of machines are horizontally oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applications such as insert molding, allowing the machine to take advantage of gravity.

Types of Injection Molding Machine: These Machines are classified primarily by the type of driving systems they use: hydraulic, mechanical, electrical, or hybrid.  Hydraulic: Hydraulic presses have historically been the only option available to molders until Nissei Plastic Industrial Co., LTD introduced the first allelectric injection molding machine in 1983. Hydraulic machines, although not nearly as precise, are the predominant type in most of the world, with the exception of Japan.  Mechanical: Mechanical type machines use the toggle system for building up tonnage on the clamp side of the machine. Tonnage is required on all machines so that the clamp side of the machine does not open (i.e. tool half mounted on the platen) due to the injection pressure. If the tool half opens up it will create flash in the plastic product.  Electric: The electric press, also known as Electric Machine Technology (EMT), reduces operation costs by cutting energy consumption and also addresses some of the environmental concerns surrounding the hydraulic press. Electric presses have been shown to be quieter, faster, and have a higher accuracy, however the machines are more expensive. Hybrid injection (sometimes referred to as "Servo-Hydraulic") molding machines claim to take advantage of the best features of both hydraulic and electric systems, but in actuality use almost the same amount of electricity to operate as an electric injection molding machine depending on the manufacturer. Advantages of using Injection Molding Unit: Following are the advantages i. Detailed Features and Complex Geometry: The injection molds are subjected to extremely high pressure. As a result the plastic within the molds is pressed harder against the mold compared to any other molding process. Due to this excessively high pressure, it is possible to

add a large amount of details into the design of the part. Furthermore, due to high pressure during the molding process, complex and intricate shapes can easily be designed and manufactured which otherwise would have been too complicated and expensive to manufacture. ii. High Efficiency: Once the injection molds have been designed to the customer’s specifications and the presses pre-programmed, the actual molding process is very quick compared to other methods of molding. Plastic injection molding process hardly takes times and this allows more parts to be manufactured from a single mold. The high production output rate makes plastic injection molding more cost effective and efficient. Typically, hot-runner ejection mold systems produce parts with more consistent quality and do so with faster cycle times, but it’s not as easy to change colours nor can hot runners accommodate some heatsensitive polymers. Learn more about the key differences between hotrunner and cold-runner systems. iii. Enhanced Strength: In plastic injection molding, it is possible to use fillers in the injection molds. These filler reduce the density of the plastic while it being molded and also help in adding greater strength to the part after it has been molded. In fields where parts need to be strong and durable, plastic injection has an option that other molding processes do not offer. iv. Ability to Use Multiple Plastic Types Simultaneously: One of the major advantages of using plastic injection molding for manufacturing parts is the ability to use different types of plastic simultaneously. This can be done with the help of co-injection molding, which takes away the worry about using a specific type of plastic. v. Automation to Save Manufacturing Costs: Plastic injection molding is an automated process. A majority of the injection molding process is performed by machines and robotics which a sole operator can control and manage. Automation helps to reduce manufacturing costs, as the overheads are significantly reduced. Furthermore, with reduced labour force the overall cost of manufacturing the parts is reduced and this cost saving can easily be passed on to the customer. Furthermore, automation allows for making precise and accurate injection molds.

Computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) allow close tolerances during the making of the molds. Injection Molded Plastics Market Analysis: The global injection molding machine market size accounted for USD 17.05 billion in 2017 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 3.5% by 2025. Growing demand for lightweight and durable products coupled with increasing adoption from the automotive and packaging industries is likely to drive this growth over the forecast period. The rising importance of lightweight materials in the automotive industry is expected to boost the use of plastic materials in automotive component manufacturing, which, in turn, will drive the market. Rapid growth in population, growing industrialization, along with technological advancements, have augmented the demand for automotive in emerging markets. It is used in applications such as interior and exterior trim components, electronic subassemblies, and under-hood applications. Plastic Injection Molding Manufacturing Process: The Injection Moulding Process is one of the plastic based product manufacturing process, this process utilizes a specialized machine called injection moulding machine which is fundamentally divided into two parts mould and injector. Wide range of plastic product can be manufactured from this machine, for each differently shaped product a separate mould is required, thus multiple products of same or different material can be manufactured on same Injection Moulding Machine by simply changing its moulds. The raw material is plastic granules which are supplied to Injection Moulding Machine via Hooper & Feeder arrangement along with required additives, these raw material are mixed in a mixer usually integrated within the Machine followed by which these granules are converted to their semi-solid state utilizing heaters of the injection moulding machine followed by which this semi-solid plastic is injected into the mould using screw or plunger arrangement. The mould is then cooled down utilizing the chiller sub-system of machine and part is ejected out of mould by ejector pins at command of the operator, these parts are then

CAR WASH UNIT INTRODUCTION WHAT IS A CAR WASH SYSTEM? Automatic car washing system is very common in developed countries. Car washing system is usually associated with fuel filling stations. It consists of large machines with automated brushes controlled by program logical controllers. Automatic car washing system is fully automated with different stages of foaming, washing, drying and brushing.

PROCESS OF AN AUTOMATIC CAR WASH SYSTEM The first automatic car washes appeared in the late 1930s. Automatic car washes consist of tunnel‐like buildings into which customers (or attendants) drive. Some car washes have their customers pay through a computerized POS (point of sale unit), also known as an "automatic cashier". The mechanism inputs the wash PLU into a master computer or a tunnel controller automatically. When the sale is automated, after paying the car is put into a line‐up often called the stack or queue. After pulling up to the tunnel entrance, an attendant usually guides the customer onto the track or conveyor. At some washes, both tires will pass over a tire sensor, and the system will send several rollers. The tire sensor lets the wash know where the wheels are and how far apart, they are. On other systems the employee may guide the customer on and hit a 'Send Car' button on the tunnel controller, to manually send the rollers which push the car through. When the customer is on the conveyor, the attendant will instruct the customer to put the vehicle into neutral, release all brakes, and refrain from steering. The rollers come up behind the tires, pushing the car through a detector, which measures vehicle length, allowing the controller to tailor the wash to each individual vehicle. The equipment frame, or arches, vary in number and type. A good car wash makes use of many different pieces of equipment and stages of chemical application to thoroughly clean the vehicle.

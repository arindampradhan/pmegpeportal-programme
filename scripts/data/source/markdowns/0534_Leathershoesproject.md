PROJECT REPORT ‘LEATHER SHOE MANUFACTURING UNIT’ EEXXEECCUUTTIIVVEE SSUUMMMMAARRYY This pre-feasibility study is for setting up of a semi-mechanized shoe manufacturing unit . Footwear manufacturing is a process of manufacturing shoes according to the market need in respect to design and size, trends etc. Shoe manufacturing industry can be broadly categorized into two main segments i.e. organized and unorganized sector. The organized sector comprises of fully mechanized shoe manufacturing units. These mainly include like Bata and other big Indian players like Khadim, Flex, Metro, Sree leathers ,Liberty shoes, Mochi ,Lee Cooper , Red Tape, Hush puppies,Woodlands etc The unorganized sector comprises of labour intensive units having semi-mechanized manufacturing facilities, with relatively modest capital investments, as compared to fully mechanized plants. The total project cost for setting up this workshop is estimated at Rs42.00 The project is financed through 75% debt and rest via equity and internal accrual. The legal business status of this project is proposed as ‘Sole Proprietorship’. The unit is proposed to operate 8 hours every day and 25 days in a month. The proposed maximum capacity of the unit is 200 pairs per day. During the first year 60% capacity is assumed, which increases at a rate of 10% each

OPPORTUNITY RATIONALE India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population. India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2024 surpassing the population of China. It is expected to become the first political entity in history to be home to more than 1.5 billion people by 2030, and its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050. Its population growth rate is 1.13%, ranking 112th in the world in 2017. Shoes are a basic necessity of every individual and India has a relatively high population growth rate. This provides an opportunity for the investor to set up a shoes manufacturing unit to meet the demands of this growing sector and earn substantial profits. Footwear is mostly manufactured in India in cottage and SSI Sector. Till recently only afew large scale units were engaged in the manufacturing of footwear. Leather Shoes are usedby all generation for their everyday use. This footwear is to the latest trend in the fashion world and at the same time being rugged enough to bear the wear and tear during the rough use. PPRROOJJEECCTT BBRRIIEEFF This document provides details for setting up shoes manufacturing unit. The unit will have the capacity to produce approximately 100 pairs of shoes per day on single shift basis. For achieving quality and consistency in the production, some second hand machinery of imported will be used. This machinery will be acquired locally. PPrrooppoosseedd BBuussiinneessss LLeeggaall SSttaattuuss The business legal status of the proposed project can either be sole proprietorship or partnership. Additionally, it can also be registered under the Companies Act, 2013 The selection depends upon the choice of the Entrepreneur. This Pre-feasibility assumes the legal status to be Sole Proprietorship. PPrrooppoosseedd CCaappaacciittyy The proposed project is capable to produce an average of 100 pairs of shoes per day. Considering the market demand and India’s population growth trends, initially the project would easily be able to produce and sell the quantity, which is required for the project to be economically viable. TTaarrggeett CCuussttoommeerr The target customer for the proposed project would be 14 years of age and above. PPrrooppoosseedd LLooccaattiioonn Most of the shoe manufacturing units are established in cities; like Agra Kanpur, Chennai, Kolahpur , Kolkata etc where there is a tradition of this trade and source of Raw material and labour is also easily accessible in these cities. 3

KKEEYY SSUUCCCCEESSSS FFAACCTTOORRSS The key to success of this project is in manufacturing good quality shoes. Quality standards should be followed strictly. Strong presence in the domestic market. Traders/Wholesalers are already present in the local Market. Tools & equipments locally available at low price. Raw materials are available in sufficient quantity. Availability of other inputs like Adhesives, chemicals, last, punch, mould, grinderies and packing materials (boxes) etc. Vast pool of skilled labour. Stable business environment till today and growing day by day. IINNDDUUSSTTRRYY AANNAALLYYSSIISS The Indian footwear industry holds a crucial place in the Indian economy for its potential for employment, especially for the economically weaker sections, and for supporting the economy through foreign exchange earnings. As per Bata India FY17 Annual report, India is the second largest footwear producer in the world, with footwear production accounting for approximately 9% of the global annual production of ~22 bn pairs, as compared to China, which produces over 60% of the global production. India annually produces ~2.2 bn pairs of footwears of which 90% is consumed internally while remaining are exported primarily to European countries. On consumption, India’s annual footwear consumption stands at ~2.1 bn pairs and it is the third largest globally after China and the USA and has recorded a healthy growth over the last decade, driven by the rise in income levels, growing fashion consciousness and increasing discretionary spending. The growth in Indian fashion and lifestyle market has given momentum to the footwear industry. From a basic need-based industry, footwear industry in India has become an evolving fashion and style category. MARKET POTENTIAL The demand for the leather shoe is increasing rapidly. The youth being very much fashion conscious they are ready to pay exorbitant price for such shoes which are made at faraway places like Agra, Delhi and Mumbai etc. Though there are many registered footwear and leather goods industries very few are manufacturing leather Shoes. There is no dearth of skilled manpower as many of the youth have undergone training in reputed like CFTIS in footwear manufacture. If manufactured locally these shoes 4

can be sold at a comparatively lower price and will not only be able to cater to the needs of the state but also supply such shoes in the markets of neighbouring states. Moreover there is a good scope for exports of such shoes. PRODUCTION PROCESS Production Process Flow A variety of materials are used for making shoes- leather fabrics, plastic, rubber, fabrics, wood, and metal. However, with the development of modern machines, a pair of shoes can be made in very less time as each step in its manufacturing is generally performed by different machines. PPaarrttss ooff FFoooottwweeaarr Sole: The exterior bottom part of a shoe is the sole. Insole: The interior bottom of a shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot, is its insole. They are removable and replaceable too. In some of the shoes, extra insoles are often added for foot comfort, foot or joint pain relief and for other reasons, such as to control the shape, moisture, or smell of the shoe. Outsole: It is that layer of the shoe that is in direct contact with the ground. These can be made of various materials like leather, natural or synthetic rubber etc. Often the heel of the sole is made from rubber for durability and traction and the front is made of leather for style. Heel: The rear part at the bottom of a shoe is the heel. It supports the heels of the feet. Heels of a shoe are often made from the same material as the sole of the shoe. It can be high for fashion purpose or for making a person look taller. They are also flat for comfort and practical use. Upper: The upper part of a shoe that helps in holding the shoe onto the foot is the vamp or simply called the upper. This part is often embellished or given different styles to make shoes attractive. Shoe making process A footwear unit has mainly four departments in which a progressive route is followed for producing finished shoes. These departments are: Clicking or Cutting Department, Closing or Machining Department, Lasting & Making Department and Finishing Department. Following is the process of footwear manufacturing. 5

Product Development: Product development is the process of designing new styles of shoes or existing ones and then specifying the materials and components, detailing the materials and the processes that are to be followed in order so that the styles of shoes can be produced in bulk. Designing and Pattern Cutting: According to the samples of shoes, design or requirement of the customer the model last is selected by the shoe designers then patterns are developed and sample shoe is manufactured in under the supervision of the shoe designer by the craftsmen/artisan. When the samples are approved the patterns are graded by hand or machines in required sizes and handed over to the production division for manufacturing the shoes. The designers also specify the materials required for making the shoes. Clicking/ Components Division: The components are clicked by hand or machine by the clicker then checked and marked by hand or by stamping machine. The upper and lining components are skived according to the manufacturing process. Closing or Machining: The component pieces are sewn together by skilled machinists so as to produce the completed upper. The work is divided in stages. In early stages, the pieces are sewn together on the flat machine. In the later stages, when the upper is no longer flat and has become three-dimensional, the machine called post machine is used. The sewing surface of the machine is elevated on a position to enable the operative to sew the three dimensional upper. Various edge treatments are also done for giving an attractive look to the finished upper. At this stage only, the eyelets are also inserted in order to accommodate the laces in the finished shoes. Lasting, Making and Finishing: The completed uppers are moulded into a shape of foot with the help of a "Last". Last simulates the foot shape. It is later removed from the finished shoe to be used further in making other shoes. Soles can also be pre- moulded as a separate component out of various synthetic materials and again glued to the lasted upper to complete the shoe. Packing: The shoe lift is inserted in the shoes to maintain the shape of the finished shoes. After this operation the finished shoes are kept in the boxes. 6

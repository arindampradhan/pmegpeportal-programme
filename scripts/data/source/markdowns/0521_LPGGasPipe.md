LPG GAS PIPE MAKING UNIT Introduction: A gas pipe is a hollow rubber tube reinforced with multiple layers for protection for better performance. The inner layer is used to provide inertness to the pipe. The second layer is braided on it to enhance the endurance of the pipe. The outer layer provides added tube protection from exterior damage and environmental deterioration, such as water, air, or heat. The cover can be color-coded to aid identification, such as orange for household and blue for industrial purposes or improve aesthetics. Uses & Market Potential: The LPG rubber pipes are used to carry the LPG gas from the LPG cylinder to the installed gas stove for cooking or heat purposes. APAC reported the largest share of the gas pipes by 2025 due to the larger population, standard mode of cooking, and advancement in basic life demands. The increased demand for gas pipes is due to increased consumption and the wide distribution of LPG gas across India. In the oil & gas industry, safety, environmental protection, and operating efficiency have prime importance for which pipes are used.

The increasing acceptance and implementation of LPG gas even in the smaller households, which convince the population to switch from another means of cooking such as coal and woods, is also a significant factor for further market growth. Product: LPG Gas Pipe Raw Material:  PVC Granules  Polyester or steel fiber  Nitrile or natural rubber  Other additives include colorant masterbatch of PVC, anti-oxidant, vulcanization agents (Sulphur), and stabilizer if needed. Manufacturing Process: Rubber Mixing Extrusion of Rubber Braiding Coating

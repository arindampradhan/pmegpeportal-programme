EXTRACTION PROCESS: The Peppermint Shoots are purchased from farmers and stored temporarily in a shaded area; it acts as a raw material inventory for distillation unit. The steam and water distillation methods are generally employed to perform a simple distillation process. The Peppermint Shoot are boiled with water in a heating vessel and are boiled for 20 to 40 minutes for optimal extraction, during this period the steam generated carries along with-it Peppermint Oil as it also gets vaporized from within shoot of plant. This steam is transferred to condenser via steam pipe, as condenser is circulated with cooling water continuously utilizing a pump, thus steam transferred to condenser undergoes condensation completing distillation process, while used cooling water is sent to cooling tower where it undergoes evaporative cooling to lower its temperature and become reusable for cooling. The cooled water in cooling tower sump is replenished periodically with make-up water from another water tank, if required via a make-up water pump to make up for evaporated water in evaporative cooling. The contents (Water + Peppermint Oil) obtained from condenser are supplied to separator and then the liquid is allowed to settle down and as oil and water are immiscible, water settles below while Peppermint Oil settles above water layer. A valve is located at bottom of the separator which is used to drain almost all the water from separator, this water is supplied back to heating vessel for enrichment purpose. The enrichment process continues for 20 to 40min, after which most of the Peppermint oil is extracted and it’s not feasible to go after the remainder of portion. Now water is completely drained from separator and oil is supplied to a filling machine. The filling machine fills the Peppermint oil in appropriately sized bottles which can range from 10ml to 500ml and machine setting are made accordingly.

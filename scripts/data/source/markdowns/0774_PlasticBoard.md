PLASTIC BOARD (SOLID CHOPPING BOARD) MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Plastic boards in the form of the solid chopping board are generally manufactured in a solid rectangular shape made up of food-grade plastic such as PP and PE and used as a base support for chopping and cutting vegetables, fruits, and sometimes meat and chicken. The manufacturing of the product must be done using food-grade plastic, as in a process such as chopping and cutting, food products are exposed to the plastic board, and sliced pieces of food come in contact with the plastic, which can contaminate the food. Thus, the plastic materials should offer high moisture resistance, stiffness, and cut resistance. Uses & Market Potential: Chopping boards provide support and surface to the foods while chopping and cutting process and protection from the untidy or contaminated surfaces. According

to the Plast India Foundation, India has a 15,788 KTA production capacity of thermoplastics alone. Similarly, engineering plastics, polyolefin, and polystyrene have a significant marketplace in India. Stringent regulations regarding depletion and recyclability of conventional materials such as metal and wood are anticipated to drive plastic demand in several applications. Plastic boards are generally quite simple to fabricate, easy to use, and provide better suitability as a food-grade material compared to metals or wood. Plastic such as PP in the plastic boards offers a wide range of color combinations, adding to their aesthetic appeal. Product: Plastic Board (Solid Chopping Board) Raw Material: Basic raw material is  PP Resin  Other additives

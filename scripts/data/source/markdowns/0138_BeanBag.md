BEAN BAG MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Bean bags and bean bag chairs are not only convenient and ergonomic, but they are also entertaining, exciting, and inexpensive. However, bean bags are more than just the brightly coloured and beautifully made covers you see on the exterior. You may not have given it much thought, but bean bag filler comes with a wide range of options, and the consistency of your finished product is dependent on selecting the right filling for your needs. You would have a clearer sense of the right filling for bean bag chairs for your family if you consider the various styles of beads that can be used inside bean bags. Bean bag chairs are all the rage today amongst mordern furniture for home and offices. These otherwise slouchy, shapeless bean filled sacs are gaining popularity as people are finding many ingenious uses for such items. The majority of bean bags are packed with expanded polystyrene, a man-made plastic (EPS). Extruded polystyrene (EPS) is a hard-celled material that is somewhat similar to Styrofoam. Aside from bean bag beads, EPS is used to make plastic coffee cups and as packing and shipping cushioning. Since it is lightweight but rigid enough to maintain its shape for many years, EPS is ideal for most inexpensive bean bag chairs. EPS is made up of 98 percent air. Bean bag filler is made up of 3 mm to 5 mm diameter EPS beads. Moisture and heat are not a problem for EPS beads.

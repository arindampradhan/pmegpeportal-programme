KHAKHARA SEMI AUTOMETIC PLANT INTRODUCTION: At present mostly Khakhara are made by hand, using traditional methods. This process requires a lot of time and consumes a lot of oil or ghee and gas. We need to depend on workers. In addition, the quality cannot be maintained uniformly because there arises difference from hand-to-hand of different workers. Moreover, this process is not so hygienic. Therefore hand-made khakhara are not so hygienic and taste & quality are not easy to maintain. The production cost is also very high. Whereas the Khakhra made from Semi-Automatic Machine are hygienic, and of good quality. Uniform taste and quality is maintained in machine. The production cost is also comparatively low.

PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Khakhara is a thin cracker common in the Gujarati and Rajasthani cuisines of western India, especially among Jains. It is made from mat bean, wheat flour and oil. It is served usually during breakfast. Khakhara is made in several varieties, such as methi (fenugreek), Khakhara is made in several varieties, such as methi (fenugreek), jeera (cumin), bajri, pudina, garlic and ajwain, among others. Mungdiis a sweet type of khakhra. It is a terrific tea time snack! It is very versatile and can be eaten as chips with a dip, topped with stuff and as chat. INDUSTRY LOOKOUT AND TRENDS Khakhra is one of the popular vegetarian roasted thin cracker bread or snack from the Gujarati cuisine. Khakhra is a common Gujarati Indian bread or snack item served during breakfast or snack time. Khakhra is simple to prepare and is made from whole wheat flour adding other ingredients and spices. Khakhra is a crispy chapatti or roti. There are several varieties of Khakhra like the methi, jeera, bajri, garlic, math and masala flavors. Khakhra is usually eaten with chutney, pickles, ghee or yoghurt. The Khakhra is a favorite ethnic food of the vegetarian Gujarati people and popular in north western India region too. It is a good non-fried item and can also be made with or without oil. In the state of Gujarat there are a number of commercial manufacturers or small scale industries catering to a variety of Khakhra and being sold to other states of India. The Khakhra is more like a readymade roasted papad. They are also tailor- made range according to the taste of the customers and also for diabetic patients preparing the karela khakhra or methi khakhra and many more. It’s a very crispy, crunchy, mouthwatering tasty nutritious and a light snack.

Easy to carry and most of the people of Gujarat carry these as snack during train travel. As preparing of Khakhra is very simple, I would always recommend all to prepare fresh Khakhra coz they would be more hygienic and nutritious. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Snack Market in India: India is one of the largest snack markets in the Asia-Pacific region. India contributes three percent to the total Asia-Pacific snack market revenue. The snack food market in India is valued at Rs. 1530 crore and is one of the largest markets in the world, out of which potato chips holds the major market share of around 85%. The Indian snacks market is worth around US$ 3 billion, with the organized segment taking half the market share, and has an annual growth rate of 15-20 per cent. The unorganized snacks market is worth US$ 1.56 billion, with a growth rate of 7-8 per cent per year. There are approximately 1,000 types of snacks and another 300 types of savories being sold in the Indian market today. Potato chips and potato-based items are the most popular products with more than 85 per cent share of the salty snack market. In the organized potato chips market, Pepsi Co’s Lays and Haldiram’s are some of the leading players. There is a big market for snacks in India as urban Indian consumers eat ready-made snacks 10 times more than their rural counterparts. Indians in the western regions eat the maximum amount of snacks, followed by the people in northern region. There is a widespread recognition in India that consumers are likely to replace light meals with snacks. The Indian Snack Market: The Indian Snacks in India, the local fare offers a wide variety of snack options, ranging from roasted banana wafers and soya chaklis (crispy savory spirals) to samosas (pastries filled with potatoes/peas). These namkeens (snacks) are typically eaten as a side dish with meals or make great accompaniments to tea, coffee, and

other beverages. Of course, these snacks vary by region, with each having its own special recipe. The snack food industry in India is highly fragmented, with the market dominated by made-at-home snacks or savories sold by local vendors. Because of expanding nuclear families and an increase in the number of female professionals, India has witnessed a significant rise in the demand for ready-to-eat snacks. The Namkeen Market: The branded salty snacks market (size: Rs 1200 crores) is 40% of the total market (size: Rs 300 crores). The branded segment is growing at the rate of 25% per annum. There is no branded Khakhara in the market, only unbranded ones. Providing a branded khakhara in different flavors and packaging with seal of quality will give us the first mover advantage. As western India consumes the maximum snacks, selling Khakhara is going to prove fruitful in the long run till the brand makes a niche for itself. The need of the hour – From the consumer’s point of view: Khakhara is an easily available ready to eat snack. It should not be too costly It should not contain high calories or should not be fried. It is something to munch on when hungry but should not be heavy on the stomach or lead to loss of appetite. It should be tasty and crunchy. It should not be perishable and easy to store. It should be branded.

Market Campaign: Media Message: The basic media message will concentrate on bringing out the health factor and home-made taste of the product to capture the attention of the target audience, and break through the clutter. The campaign will take a comic route to connect with the audience as humor interests everybody irrespective of age, gender and social background. This will help in creating a single message for the scattered target audience. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: Basic raw materials required for Khakhara is: Wheat flour (and/or refined flour), Salt, Masala, Oil, Water or Milk. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: To make Khakhara, the dough is converted into thin sheets. The sheets are cut in round shapes. They are baked on the Hot Plate and later roasted in the roasting machine to reduce the moisture content fully. Properly packed Khakhra have a longer shelf life. Machines involved in making Khakhara: 1. Dough Making Machine: To prepare the dough for Khakhara by mixing flour with salt and water. 2.

5. Roasting Machine: To roast the baked Khakhara, reducing its moisture content and preparing it for packing. 6. Vacuum Packing Machine To pack the Khakhra into suitable printed vacuumed packets. This unit will have 60 Ton /Annum capacity. The growth of selling capacity will be increased 10% per year . STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries. The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry. The act brought into force in place of the PFA is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "FSSA") that overrides all other food related laws. FSSA initiates harmonization of India's food regulations as per international standards. It establishes a new national regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as "FSSAI"), to develop science based standards for food and to regulate and monitor the manufacture, processing, storage, distribution, sale and import of food so as to ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board where ever it is applicable.

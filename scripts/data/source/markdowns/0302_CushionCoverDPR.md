CUSHION COVER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Cushions are used inside the house as well as outdoors on the patio or in the garden, so the fabric you pick should reflect this. Cushions in a bedroom, for example, do not need to be as durable as those in your main area or on your garden seat. A cushion for an underused chair does not need to be as long-lasting as one for the main family sofa. There are various sorts of synthetic materials that may be used in the house for common purposes. Polyester and nylon are commonly utilised in the production of cushion coverings. Most synthetic materials are made up of a variety of fibres that may be used to resemble anything from silk to wool. Apart from natural fibres such as cotton, silk, wool, linen, and others, man-made fibres such as polyester, rayon, nylon, polypropylene, Teflon, recron, acrylic, and others are also widely used in household textiles. Cushions are an excellent way to bring colour and design to your home. Because they dress up a room, they act as jewels. They provide you the opportunity to show off your uniqueness and originality. They also make a space feel more welcoming and cosier. Even better than using store-bought cushions is to make your own cushion covers. Uses & Market Potential: Using a pillow or cushion cover will help to prevent bacteria, dirt, and dead skin from accumulating within a pillow. Zippered cushion covers are simple to remove and wash, ensuring that your pillows stay fresh, fluffy, and spotless. Cushions and cushions are also known for trapping and retaining allergens. The worldwide home textiles market was estimated at USD 94.73 billion in 2018, with a CAGR of 5.01 percent predicted from

2019 to 2025. The worldwide market is expected to be driven by growth in end-use sectors such as hospitality and residential, as well as growing knowledge about shifting home décor trends. Developing nations account for around 60% of European textile furnishings imports, including cushion coverings. Cushion covers are classified as home textiles in the home decorating and home textiles (HDHT) industry. A cushion cover, like a pillowcase, is a cloth covering that covers cushions.

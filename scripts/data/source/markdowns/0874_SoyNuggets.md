PROJECT PROFILE ‘SOY NUGGETS’ INTRODUCTION: Soya bean nuggets are normally known as vegetarian meat. The reason behind the same is because it possesses similar properties like original meat. Soya bean is a rich source of protein and among all vegetarian food products; it has highest level of protein (50%). It is prepared from defatted (DOC) soya flour by the process of extrusion cooking. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Soya Nuggets are as good as original meat. They possess similar properties in terms protein content. They are also similar chewy characteristics on soaking in water. Also, they are free from cholesterol, and thus heavily used as meat substitutes. These nuggets can be used in preparing various food products in households as well as in restaurants and can be important because of its high nutritional value. INDUSTRY LOOKOUT AND TRENDS Soybean meal is segmented on the basis of the raw material as Organic and inorganic. Due to rising health concerns people prefer organic soybean meals as organic products are good for health. Soybean meal market is segmented on the basis of process of production as normal soybean meal, De-hulled [min 50% protein] Hipro Soybean meal, and De-hulled [min. 48% protein] Hipro Soybean meal, Defatted soya flour toasted, and de-fatted soya flakes toasted are available in the market. Normal soybean meal has low protein content than the De-hulled soybean meal which has around 45-46% of crude protein content. Hulls are by-product, therefore, are removed as they have no place in human food but are used for ruminants.

Soybean meal is segmented on the basis of application in food industry, beverage, dietary supplements, and healthcare products. In food market segment soymeal can be used for making soy-chunks and soy-granules. Flour of deflated soy is used to make nutritious biscuits. Isolates of protein from soymeal are used as protein drinks. Product from soymeal is healthy and nutritious thus market demand from food and beverage market segments is high. In healthcare products market segment, soymeal is used to make products having isoflavones which have chemical similarity to estrogen. Demand from dietary supplement market segment is higher as soymeal is used to make calcium, magnesium, iron, and folic acid rich supplements. Soybean meal is segmented on the basis of distribution channel as supermarket, specialized stores, online stores and retail stores. Online stores are the most preferred mode of shopping for consumer and manufacturer as it is comfortable for both. Supermarkets also have gained good consumer base in last 10 years and are expected to grow at a significant rate. Soybean meal is the highly nutritive meal for the farm animals; it is used as a feed for the farm animals like chicks, horse, sheep, pig, and fish. It has high protein content which is important for the health of the animals; it is the most used feed for livestock. It has been used as a standard for comparing the protein content of food products. It is approved in the United States as an ideal feed for livestock and its production has increased due to control over slaughterhouse by-product as feed and encouraged the use of soybean meal due to high protein content it has and thus, increase in demand as protein-rich source for livestock feed. Soybean meal market is forecasted to grow at the significant growth rate over near future due to its extremely high protein content which is around 47-49% of protein content and other nutritional contents like crude fibre.

MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Soya bean being the principal corps in western and central parts of Madhya Pradesh, there is good amount of raw materials available for soya nuggets manufacturing. Setting up a plant in or near Madhya Pradesh can help in saving lot of transportation cost as well. Soya Nuggets with high quality and hygienically processing can be essential for preparing various gravies, curries, pulao, biryani etc. as it blends very well with both meat as well as vegetables. With implementation various food standards such as FSSAI, FSMS, ISI and ISO standards, there can be huge market growth for manufacturer for packed soya nuggets. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: Defatted Soya flour is basic raw material required to prepare soya nuggets. For packing, HDPE Bag with inner liners (food grade) are required and to pack those bags for transportation in bulk, cardboard boxes are required. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The ingredients comprising high protein dispersible defatted soya flour and water are extruded in the cooker extruder. The product obtained is in the form of small round balls with a moisture content of 17 - 18%. It is taken to the drier by a belt conveyer system where the product is dried at 100 to 105 degrees centigrade for 20 to 25 minutes. In the drier the moisture content reduces to 8%. From the drier the product is conveyed to the grader where grading takes place according to the size of the chunks. The product is then packed in consumer packs of 100 grams or in bulk of 20 kilograms in HDPE bags depending upon the market requirement. STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries.

The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry. The act brought into force in place of the PFA is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "FSSA") that overrides all other food related laws. FSSA initiates harmonization of India's food regulations as per international standards. It establishes a new national regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as "FSSAI"), to develop science based standards for food and to regulate and monitor the manufacture, processing, storage, distribution, sale and import of food so as to ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board where ever it is applicable. BACKWARD AND FORWARD INTEGRATIONS The objective of the scheme is to provide effective and seamless backward and forward integration for processed food industry by plugging the gaps in supply chain in terms of availability of raw material and linkages with the market. Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided for setting up of primary processing centres/ collection centres at farm gate and modern retail outlets at the front end along with connectivity through insulated/ refrigerated transport. The Scheme is applicable to perishable horticulture and non-horticulture produce such as, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, Ready to Cook Food Products, Honey, Coconut, Spices, Mushroom, Retails Shops for Perishable Food Products etc. The Scheme would enable linking of farmers to processors and the market for ensuring remunerative prices for Agri produce.

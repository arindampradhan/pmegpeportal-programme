INTRODUCTION Coffee beverage imparts refreshing and stimulating effect and is extremely popular throughout the world. Almost entire consumption of coffee is in the form of beverages, with or without milk or cream, chilled or hot. Though the consumption of coffee is increasing day by‐day in the country, no attempt has so far been make to commercialize a ready to serve coffee beverage on a large scale except limited efforts made by a few co‐operative milk marketing societies in some states. The non availability of the cost of manufacture of the product appears to be one of the main reasons that the food industry has not taken up its production in organized way. This profile highlights the cost of manufacture for ready to serve coffee flavored milk drink. MARKET POTENTIAL The availability of coffee flavored milk in the compared to its potential demand is very small in volume. As the national awareness has caught on among the consumers, the demand for such drinks is increasing. It is equally liked by all irrespective of age. It could register good sale at airports, bus stops, railway stations, restaurants, hotels, picnic spots, college canteens, etc. Hence the availability of market would not be a big challenge for such nutritional products. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS 1 . The scheme is based on 75% efficiency 24 hrs. a day for 300 days a year. 2 . Time period required to achieve full capacity utilization is possibly 4‐5 years. 3 . Labour wages is as per the rates prevailing in the area. 4 . Interest rate for total capital investment has been taken @14% per annum for both fixed and working capital. 5 . Marging money is 25% of total capital investment. 6 . Pay back period of the projects is 7 years. 7 . Land cost & construction cost have been taken @ Rs 10/sq ft. and Rs 300/sq. ft. respectively.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE The fresh cow and buffalo milk received is first standardized to its fat content. The milk is then heated to 40 C and filtered through a double muslin cloth. Then again heated to 60 C and stabilizers like TSC & DSHP added @ 0.002% . This milk is then passed to homogenizer for breaking the fat globules and make uniformity in the product. On other side, the coffee powder of 5% concentration is added to hot water and filtered through a muslin cloth. Finally homogenized milk, hot coffee water and sugar syrup are mixed in proper proportion and heated to 85C for 30minutes. The sterilized bottles are cooled at room temperature and then stored in wooden crates. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARS As per PFA Regulations PRODUCTION CAPACITY (PER ANNUM) QUANTITY 465000 (crates of 24 bottles 200 ml) Value Rs 418.5 Lakhs MOTIVE POWER 80 HP POLLUTION CONTROL As per the state govt. pollution control board.

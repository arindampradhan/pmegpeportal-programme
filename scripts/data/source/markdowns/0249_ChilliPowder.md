1. INTRODUCTION Increases Your Energy Levels Chilli (Capsicum annuum L.) is a vegetable that belongs to the Solanaceae family. Chilies come in over 400 different varieties and are known by common names such as chillies, chile, chilli peppers, bell peppers, red peppers, pod peppers, cayenne peppers, paprika, pimento, and capsicum in various parts of the world. Among the spices, dried chilli accounts for the bulk of intake. The dye ‘capsanthin' is responsible for the red colour of chilies. The alkaloid ‘capsaicin' contained in the pericarp and placenta of chilies gives them their biting pungency. Vitamins (especially A and C), potassium, magnesium, and iron are all abundant in chilies. Chilies are used to alleviate discomfort and have the capacity to raise the immune system, reduce cholesterol, and assist in the removal of gut parasites. Chillies are grown in all Asian countries, as well as large parts of Africa, the United States, and Southern Europe. In India Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu are the most significant chilli-growing states. Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Karnataka are the top producers of dry chillies. Chillies are commonly used in three forms: fresh green chillies, red chilli powder, and raw red chillies. Chilli powder is prepared from ripe chilli. It is an important spice used as flavorings or condiments, in the tropics and subtropics and an indispensable item in the kitchen for everyday cooking in Bangladesh. Chilli is dried to make chilli powder and to store for both short and long- term storage. Chilli powder is made from ripe chilli peppers. In the tropics and subtropics, it's a

common spice for flavourings and condiments, and in India, it's a must-have in the kitchen for everyday cooking. Chillies are dried to make chilli powder and to store for both short and long periods of time. Colour and pungency are the two most important quality characteristics in chilli. Chilli's red colour is due to carotenoid pigments. The oxidation of carotenosis pigments that is mostly dependent on humidity, storage, temperature, atmosphere and light has contributed to the colour-deterioration of chilli powder. Chilli powder moisture content is an important factor during storage for colour preservation. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Chilli with stem, chilli without stem, crushed dried red chilli flakes, dried red chilli powder, chilli paste, chilli chutney, chilli seeds and chilli oil (oleoresin) are the various processed products of chillies used for culinary and commercial purposes. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The clean and dried chillies with stem obtained after primary processing is used as the raw material for the production of all the products. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS  Raw Material Procurement: Raw materials should be received & stored in hygienic condition. The quality of the raw material should be checked carefully.  The stems of the clean, dry chillies are sliced with a knife or a chilli stem cutting unit. In general, using a stem cutting system saves time and resources.  The milling method is also known as the grinding process. For grinding, a hammer mill is commonly used. To produce the fine chilli powder, either the crushed material is moved 2-3 times through small hammer mills with centrifugal blowers, cyclone separators, and sifting machines, as well as a lump breaker between the hammer mills, or a big hammer mill is used.  Chilli powder with conventional fragrance and consistency is obtained using an electric motor-driven kandap system that works on the principle of traditional pounding of chillies.  Sieving is achieved using a fine mesh centrifugal sifter. Internal shaft with rubber blades rotates to crack lumps as it moves through fine mesh of ideal size to yield smooth fine chilli powder.

 The fine red chilli powder is vacuum-transported from one location to another inside the premises. For healthy packing, red chilli powder with a moisture content of less than 8% is recommended. Printed disposable pouches, pouches in mono-carton cases, high density polyethylene and Saran / Cello / Saran poly laminate pouches, and composite, rubber, and glass jars are used to package the chilli powder. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities, cutting & filling area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small-scale factory setup is 1000-1500 Sq. ft. approximately. Micro, small and medium enterprises are engaged in this work accounting for the total manufacturing units. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs. 20,000- 30,000 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery This manufacturing unit will be manual or semi-automatic type. In manual process only few equipment’s are required. For cutting and chopping stainless steel knives & plastic chopping boards are required.  Hammer Mill: Hammer mill is commonly used for grinding. Either the crushed material is passed 2-3 times through the small hammer mills with centrifugal blowers.

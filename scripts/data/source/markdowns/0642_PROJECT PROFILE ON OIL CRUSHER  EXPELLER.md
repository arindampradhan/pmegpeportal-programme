## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON OIL CRUSHER / EXPELLER Introduction : Oil crusher/expellers are used to crush the oil seeds for extracting oil from the seeds. Different types of oil seeds are available to product different types of oil seeds, Oil expellers are available in various sizes like 4 bolts, 6 bolts, 9 bolts, 12 bolts etc. In the past, conventional Ghani was in vogue to produce oil from seeds, but in that process, considerable quantity of oil was left over in the oil cakes. With the advent of oil expellers/crushers, the seeds are crushed and oil expelled to a great extent. Raw materials required for Oil Crusher/Expeller are i) Cast parts, forged parts, plates tubes, pipes, shafts, bars, sheets, sections etc. (ii) Electric motors (10 HP) starters, capacitors switches, other electric items (iii) Oil, grease, consumables etc. Process of Manufacture: Production processes will mainly involve machining, fabrication, assembly and testing etc. Various cast parts, forged parts, electric motors starters, switches, capacitors etc. will be purchased from outside. There is good demand for edible/non-edible oils. Different seeds are crushed to produce oils of different types that is edible or non- edible. The seeds coming from agricultural produces or agro produces are crushed to obtain oil for food purpose or medicinal use or industrial use. Since the demand for all such oils is constantly increasing, the demand for oil crushers/expellers is also increasing considerably. They are used by food industries, agricultural & agro-based industries. Besides domestic demand, oil crushers/expellers have very good export market.

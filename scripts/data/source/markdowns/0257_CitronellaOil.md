PROJECT REPORT ON CITRONELLA OIL INTRODUCTION Citronella oil is one of the major essential oils. It has a rose like odour and bitter taste. It is mainly used in the perfumery and cosmetic industry. Citronella oil is a raw material for production of geranial, citronellal, hydroxy- citronellal and other similar high value perfumery bases. It is also widely used as a starting material for various aromatic chemicals used in scented soaps, sprays, deodorants, detergents, polishes, mosquito repellants etc. Citronella oil is an oil derived majorly from citronella grass, also called as Cymbopogon nardus. The cultivation of the grass requires rich moisture content and sunshine. The oil can also be derived from different cymbopogon species. The citronella oil is considered as one of the industrially important essential oil. This is owing to the key advantages of citronella oil such as flavour additive, fragrances in cosmetic and perfume industries. The citronella oil contains more than 80 components some of which are at high concentration in oil and functions as repellent property of oil. Some of the important components such as geranial, limonene and citronellal are considered to have desirable repellent characteristics. Citronella oil is a prominent essential oil made from the extracts of a distinct species Cymbopogon plant. Stems and leaves of this species, commonly known as lemongrass, are used for making citronella oil extracts. The oil is primarily used as a source in production of perfumery chemicals such as citronellal and citronellol. Citronella Oil is one of the important component in perfume manufacturing. Personal care products like soaps, household cleaners, and

detergents use Citronella Oil due to its antiseptic characteristics. Flavouring capacity of Citronella oil is use in Alcoholic and non- alcoholic beverages, Baked products, Soft and hard candies, Gelatin and puddings, Frozen dairy. On medical grounds Citronella Oil is potent antifungal helps to reduce Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Eurotium fungi species that causes fungal infection in humans and animals. MARKET OUTLOOK Citronella oil constitutes over 90% of the production of essential oils in the country. The major customers are the manufacturers of cosmetics and perfumes who are the manufacturers of cosmetics and perfumes who are mainly located in Mumbai, Bangalore, Madras. Procurement of citronella oil is in the hands of four major buyers, namely, Hindustan Lever Limited, Industrial Perfumes, K. V. Aromatics and Gupta & Co Growth of Citronella Oil Market primarily driven by extensive use in perfume and insect repellent industry. Germany, Spain and France are largest importer of Citronella Oil for perfume manufacturing. Mosquito repellent industry is growing tremendously attributed to rise in mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue and global warming, which favors breeding of mosquitoes. Increse in health awareness is propelling fuel to use of mosquito repellent spray and lotions which automatically increasing demand for Citronella Oil. The global market for citronella oil is mainly due to the growing demand of the perfumery and cosmetics industries. Lemongrass oil offers many remedies, including the control of anxiety and stress, the ability to eliminate insects and leeches from the body, etc. These are some of the factors that stimulate the global consumption of lemon grass oil. In addition, citronella oil has unique properties, such as olfactory and stable technical properties. These properties are extremely essential for industries such as perfumes, since they must incorporate essences of composition and suitable mixture, which in turn stimulate the world citronella oil market. However, the citronella oil substitute, such as citrus and turpentine synthetic eucalyptus isolates, could restrict the world market for lemongrass oil. The global citronella oil market is primarily driven by the increasing demand from perfume and cosmetic industries. Citronella oil offers wide remedies some of which are anxiety and stress control, ability to eject bugs and leeches from body etc. Citronella oil prevents the spread of internal and external infections. These are some of the factors which is boosting the global citronella oil consumption. Furthermore, citronella oil has some unique properties such as distinctive olfactory and steady technical properties. These properties are highly essential for industries such as perfume to incorporate appropriate blending and compounding essences which in turn actually drives the global citronella oil market.

The rising consumer awareness about the ill-health effects of synthetic chemicals used for adding texture & fragrances and for increasing the aesthetic appeal of the food products and increased awareness about health benefits associated with the consumption of essential oils has contributed towards the growth of global essential oils market. PLANT CAPACITY The capacity of a citronella oil plant depends mainly on the size of the distillation stills which is the main production unit. Plants are available in varying sizes with processing capacities ranging from 500 Kg to 1000 Kg per batch. Annual production envisaged is 6 tpa on the following basis. Throughput capacity 1000 Kg of citronella grass

Process time per batch 3 ½ to 4 hours No. of shifts per day 2 No. of batches/day 3 Yield of citronella oil 0.8% Daily output 24 Kg. Working days per year 250 Annual output 6 tonne RAW MATERIALS The chief raw material is Java citronella grass which grows on sandy loamy soil. It has high affinity for moisture but cannot withstand waterlogging conditions. The most favorable planting period is during the rainy season from April to September though planting during other seasons is also possible with irrigation. Application of fertilizers is necessary for good growth and yield. About six cuttings are possible in a year. After the harvest, citronella grass is withered in the shade for 24 hours before distillation. The average life of a citronella plantation is about 5 years. The annual requirement of citronella grass for a 6 tpa plant is 750 tonne. PROCESS Technology for manufacture of citronella oil is readily available with the Regional Research Laboratory, Jorhat. Extraction of citronella oil is a distillation process. The process of distillation consists of the release of oil in the form of vapour from the leaves in conrtact with steam and condensing the mixture of oil vapour and steam to oil and water. The distillation unit consists of two parts – mild steel still in which the grass is placed and exposed to steam and a condenser which condenses the vapour/ steam mixture to water and oil. Before the process starts, the distillation still is filled with water and a grid is put on top. The citronella grass leaves are lightly packed on the grid. On top of this Hessian or other packing materials are placed and covered with timber. A thick layer of mud is put along flanges before the cover is fastened. The oil and water condensate flow into a receptacle where the oil floats on the water surface. MACHINERY The major equipment required for a citronella oil plant are as follows: Distillation plant with steam generator : 1 Set Lid lifting gear : 1 No. Furnace and accessories : 1 Set Separator : 1 No.

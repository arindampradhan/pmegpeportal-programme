CEMENT GRILL Introduction: Cement grills have occupied an important role in the building constructions. Cement grills are pierced panels with a thickness of not less than 2.5 cm. They are used in construction of houses, buildings etc. as partition panels in the walls and ventilators. Very often cement grill is a better substitute for a window. It lets in general subdued light. It also deals with ventilation but prevents rain from entering. It is secured from thieves or animals. It of different designs and shapes are made according to needs. It is cheaper than wood or steel jali. Market Potential: The demand for cement grills increases correspondingly with the increase of building construction activity which is fast growing in the country. Apart from low cost, other contributing factors to their demand are facinating designs and functional qualifies in the market. Though the consumption of cement grill in Bihar state is about 1,00,00,000 sq.ft in a year, there are around fifty to sixty units running to meet the

requirements. The gap in demand & supply is met by the product transported from other adjoining states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Jharkhand. There is a good scope to develop MSE units in this line of manufacture for local consumption. Machines & equipments: Major machines & equipments are: Name Qty. Price Moulds/frames (iron) 1 90000 Wooden planks 1 15000 Concrete hand mixer 1 40000 Vibrator with 1 Hp motor and starter 1 000 Curing tank 10'x5'x3' 2 80000 Pollution control equipment LS 2550000 Other tools & equipments LS 60000 Raw material: Major raw material requirement are: 1. Portland cement 2. Sand 3. MS Rod & wire 4. Other materials Manufacturing Process: Though not much advanced technology is employed in the manufacturing of cement grills, the techniques in designing and shaping have developed since these items find use in the multi-storeyed building as ventilators and partition panels in walls. The process of manufacturing is simple, as the technical aspects involved are very less and do not require any heavy machineries. One concrete hand mixture (local made) and iron or wooden moulds are required for the manufacture of cement grills.

The moulds are lubricated with kerosene oil and kept ready for moulding. The cement and sand in proper ratio (i.e. 1:3) with proportionate water is mixed to make concrete mixer. The moulds are then filled with the concrete mixer duly providing reinforcement with M S rods and wires at suitable depth. The excess material spread over the mould is removed and the surface is smoothened with the help of a trowel. The grills in different shapes and designs are then removed about 24 hours. These are then immersed in water for 14 days for curing in order to develop strength and make more durable. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1200Sqft. Civil work will cost around 4 Lac (approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 security Guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and sales personal each.

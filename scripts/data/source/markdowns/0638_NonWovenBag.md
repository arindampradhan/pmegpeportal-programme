Market Potential Global nonwoven fabric market is estimated be valued at US$ 35.4 Bn by 2016 end, and is projected to expand at a high single-digit CAGR in terms of value during the forecast period, 2016– 2024. The rising demand for hygiene products such as baby diapers, toddler training pants, feminine hygiene and personal care products, and adult incontinence products has been driving the non-woven fabrics market during the forecast period. Several hospitals and clinics are increasingly using non-woven disinfected fabrics to eliminate the risks of cross-contamination and infections, which has subsequently surged the sales of Class IV surgical garments and face masks. By observing the rapidly growing demand for these disposable non-woven products, manufacturers are coming up with innovative hygiene products in the market. Increasing demand for personal hygiene products coupled with growing population is expected to be a key driving factor for the growth of nonwoven fabrics market over the forecast period. Increasing birth rate and aging population has contributed to growing demand for hygiene products such as baby diapers, sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products which in turn is expected to fuel the demand for nonwoven fabrics. Nonwovens are used in road construction in the form of geotextiles to increase the durability of roads. Low maintenance costs associated with nonwovens is expected to fuel its demand in construction applications. Positive outlook on global automobile and transportation industry is further expected to propel growth for nonwoven fabrics market over the next six years. Automobile industry manufactures a large number of exterior and interior parts using nonwoven fabrics owing to its durability, moldability and being lightweight. Positive outlook on the global automotive industry is expected to have a positive impact on the market over the next six years. The shift in trend towards adoption of safety measures while following practices in the medical industry is also expected to have a positive influence on global nonwoven fabrics market growth. India’s nonwoven market is growing at a rate of 8-10%. At present, the production of Nonwoven in India is touching 190000 Tons out of which Spun bond nonwoven fabrics production is approximately 83000 Tons. The per capita Nonwoven fabric consumption in India is 155 gm; which will touch to 350 gm by 2015 and 600 gm by 2020.

Manufacturing Process If you start this business, you don’t have to depend on a higher number of labors for the manufacturing process. Maximum of one or two will suffice the need. There are different machines which will do the maximum of the manufacturing work. Below are the different required machines: –  Non-woven bag making machine: – The function of this bag making machine is to cut the fabric is the desired size after passing through the rollers.  Auto handle sealing machine: – This machine is required to attach handles to the main body of the bags. It uses hydraulic pressure for the process.  Printing Machine: – This is required to print designs on the fabric roll. It can be general prints or as per the demand of the customer. For manufacturing plain bags, this machine is not required.  Printing machine roller: – This helps to straighten the fabric of the bag There are two ways of selling these bags. First the bags are sold to the customer and then the customer gets the printing done. Secondly both the bag printing and cutting is done and then sold to the customer. Non-woven bag manufacturing is completed in a few steps and it is largely automated. Manpower required in a factory is also less. 1. First the fabric roll is checked for the desired quality. 2. Then it is passed through the printing plate and later cut into fixed size pieces 3. The handle is stamped on the main body of the bag with a hydraulic stamping machine.

Detail of raw material NONWOVEN FABRIC- RAW MATERIAL Nonwoven fabric is a fabric-like material made from staple fiber (short) and long fibers (continuous long), bonded together by chemical, mechanical, heat or solvent treatment. The term is used in the textile manufacturing industry to denote fabrics, such as felt, which are neither woven nor knitted. Some nonwoven materials lack sufficient strength unless densified or reinforced by a backing. In recent years, nonwovens have become an alternative to polyurethane foam. Nonwoven fabrics are broadly defined as sheet or web structures bonded together by entangling fiber or filaments (and by perforating films) mechanically, thermally or chemically. They are flat or tufted porous sheets that are made directly from separate fibers, molten plastic or plastic film. They are not made by weaving or knitting and do not require converting the fibers to yarn. Typically, a certain percentage of recycled fabrics and oil-based materials are used in nonwoven fabrics. The percentage of recycled fabrics vary based upon the strength of material needed for the specific use. In addition, some nonwoven fabrics can be recycled after use, given the proper treatment and facilities. For this reason, some consider nonwovens a more ecological fabric for certain applications, especially in fields and industries where disposable or single use products are important, such as hospitals, schools, nursing homes and luxury accommodations. Nonwoven fabrics are engineered fabrics that may be single-use, have a limited life, or be very durable. Nonwoven fabrics provide specific functions such as absorbency, liquid repellence, resilience, stretch, softness, strength, flame retardancy, washability, cushioning, thermal insulation, acoustic insulation, filtration, use as a bacterial barrier and sterility. These properties are often combined to create fabrics suited for specific jobs, while achieving a good balance between product use-life and cost. They can mimic the appearance, texture and strength of a woven fabric and can be as bulky as the thickest paddings. In combination with other materials they provide a spectrum of products with diverse properties, and are used alone or as components of apparel, home furnishings, health care, engineering, industrial and consumer goods.

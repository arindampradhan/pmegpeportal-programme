AUTOMOBILE SPOKES Introduction: Spokes are the connecting rods between the bicycle hub and the rim. Their main purpose is to transfer the loads between the hub and the rim, which are caused by the weight of the rider and the bike. When the wheel is built all the spokes are tightened to a high tension, more tension than the weight of a person adds. This spoke tension preloads the whole rim with compressive stress, enough to stop the rim area below the hub from buckling. Spokes have nut-like devices at the rim called nipples. When viewed from above, nipples are turned clockwise with the spoke wrench to tighten spoke tension and counterclockwise to loosen it. Modern spokes are available in a variety of lengths, shapes, materials, finishes, and attachment types. All spokes provide the basic function of connecting the hub to the rim. This seemingly straight forward static function becomes far more complex when we consider dynamic loading patterns. Bicycle wheels operate under complex repeated loading conditions referred to as "fatigue cycles". Spokes must carry combined loading from the following primary sources. Uses & Market Potential: The fortunes of the auto sector turned upside down last year. New vehicle sales grew by 14.2 per cent overall in 2017-18

(over 2016-17), more than double the 6.8 per cent growth in 2016-17 (over 2015-16). The good run continued into April-September 2018, with overall auto sales growing by 10.07 per cent in this period. The global automotive wheels aftermarket is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.53% during the forecast period to reach USD 4.5 billion by 2025 from an estimated USD 3.5 billion in 2018. The automobile industry has witnessed a continuous increase in the average weight of the vehicle owing to the rising demand for safety and comfort features. This has led to huge innovations and R&D efforts from both the OEMs and aftermarket players in increasingly using lightweight materials to reduce the overall weight. Raw material: Major raw material are as follows: 1. Mild steel wire rolls(2 mm to 4 mm) 2. Nipples 3. Electroplating chemical 4. Pickling chemical 5. Packing material Machinery Requirement: Major machineries & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1 Automatic spoke forming machine 1 set 700000 2 Electroplating Plant 1 set 390000 3 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 110000 Total Amount 1200000 Manufacturing Process: The main raw material is mild steel wire coil/rod of required diameter. The MS Rod Wire set of desired diameter (2 mm, 2.3 mm, etc.) with some allowable tolerances as per the customer requirement are procured from the local vendor. These wire rods are fed through the acids for cleaning and etching process to remove dust and forming wire set rust-resistant. The acid and etching solutions are formed in a

tank and the wire set of MS Rod has been placed in the tank with hanging and rolling arrangement for sufficient time. In the next step, these coils are fed into Automatic spoke forming machine. The wire set fed into the machine through rolling arrangement. These rollers first straighten the wire. The combination for reducing wire of die-rolls studs on which they revolve, shafts carrying such studs and eccentric to machine axis. Then machine cuts the wire along its length and fed into head upsetting arrangement. This forms the head of the spoke by press fitting. In the next step the head is given an angular bend by bending device. Threads are made over bend head by rolling the wire between two threaded dies of size 1.8mm. The critical thing is that the spoke threads far enough into the nipple. If the spoke doesn't thread far enough into the nipple, the head of the nipple is not as strong as it should be and can eventually collapse. After this, nipples are threaded to the spokes. In the next step, these spokes are fed into electroplating plant for chemical treatment to make them wear and corrosion resistant. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1

2. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Gates, Grills, Fencing are essentially made from steel via fabrication of various sections, sheets and pipes. These products are a norm for all most all premises to install to cover area under their ownership. Railings and grills are part of protection and are also used as structure for most of stairways, people movement management and to provide natural view of both inside or outside of the covered areas. Depending on the location and use, these products are designed with several geometric patterns and décor. They are made from wood, stone, cast iron, or metals like mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum, brass, bronze etc. 3. DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROMOTER: A person with ITI, Diploma, or experience in the products. 4. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK/TREND The grill fences and railings fabrication industry in India comprises various medium and small companies that manufacture wide range of simple and decorative ornamental products form mild steel, stainless steel sections tubes and rods, as also from cast items. The units in this sector compete with offer for various innovative designs and patterns with lowest costs. The medium and small companies are located all over India and also take up the general fabrication services to industries. Most innovative designers of these items dominate the market and lately the stainless steel fabricators are coming of age in view of shopping and other commercial buildings in urban centers. The leading units in unorganized sector follow proper standards and specification of materials used. The technology and market trend is of new finishes with bright brass/ copper/ golden color metal and color plating techniques, with/ without engraving and other decorative designs. 5. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES. IF ANY: These products are a normal feature for construction industry for new and old premises. Commercial and domestic buildings use railing and gates/ doors for indoor for protection and décor and fences for marking the land plots. The Indian industry is dominated by low technology and very rare technological innovation is taken up. However, in recent years, the demand of stainless steel indoor railings and grills is rising. Demand for fence, grill and railing is mostly from new or redevelopment/ remodeling of housing and commercial buildings. The improvement in contemporary designs and décor is anticipated to improve demand significantly due to rapid industrial investments. Factors such as lower wastage weather and wear resistance coatings, higher productivity and better quality will lead to wide usage of new products. The segment is projected to witness moderate growth. The growth of construction industry with growing population is the main demand driver. There is very good potential for good design and aesthetic designed products.

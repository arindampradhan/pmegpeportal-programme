GALVANIZED IRON ROOFING SHEETS INTRODUCTION: Corrugated galvanized iron or steel is a building material composed of sheets of hot-dip galvanized mild steel, cold-rolled to produce a linear corrugated pattern in them. By galvanizing, protection of the steel structures against corrosion resistance is improved by numerous degrees of magnitude; the corrosion protection achieved by zinc-based coatings is as a result of the galvanic effect, because zinc is anodic to iron which make it acts a sacrificial metal in an aqueous or humid environment. The most common method of zinc coating is the hot-dip process in which steel sheet passes through a bath of molten zinc. The liquid zinc bonds to the iron in the steel forming a protective layer on both sides of the sheet. Gauge indicates the thickness of the sheet material. It is often stated as a number. The lower the gauge number, the thicker the material. The exact thickness will depend on the type of material such as stainless steel, or aluminum. In most cases, the lower gauge, thicker material is a stronger, more durable product within the same type of material. A material with a lower gauge number will weigh more, and may also be more difficult for the installer to work with.

USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Corrugated steel sheets are a popular siding and roofing choice for agricultural and commercial buildings, owing to their strength and durability. Corrugated steel sheets are commonly used in the residential sector in large amount in the form of roofing and siding options. Corrugated steel sheets have a "wavy" pattern, although several other patterns are available to choose from - including more linear and square-edged shapes. Corrugated steel sheets are manufactured using a cold-form process, in which sheets of steel are pressed flat and then run through a roll forming process. In the process of roll forming, the sheets are hard-pressed using rolling dies that create the corrugation shapes. The global corrugated steel sheets market is fueled by high demand from the commercial and agriculture sectors for use in applications such as warehouses, farm houses, garages, porches, and sheds. Corrugated steel sheets are majorly used in agricultural buildings, as these sheets feature repetitive folds on their surface. On account of the unique shape, corrugated steel sheets offer enhanced strength and reliable utility for years. PRODUCT: Corrugated Galvanized Roofing Sheets RAW MATERIAL: Mild Steel Sheets (0.4 to 3 mm) (https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/ms-sheet-11130883933.html) Zinc Metal Ingots (https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/zinc-metal-ingot- 4803148588.html)

At first, the raw material is procured from the authorized local vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the mild steel sheets are dipped in H SO acid tank for pickling process. This process removes the dirt, foreign 2 4 impurities and harmful chemicals from the surface of the sheet. The sheet is being kept inside the tank for 15-20 minutes. After this, sheets are taken out and allowed to dry. In the next step, the heating furnace is brought up to the desired melting temperature of zinc of nearly 450 – 500℃. The zinc billets are brought from the inventory and fed inside heating furnace tank through furnace feeder. The molten zinc is stored in the galvanizing tank. Suitable heating arrangements are made to keep the zinc in molten form. Zinc ammonium chloride is also added in the tank in desired quantity that acts as a flux medium for molten zinc. This prevents the oxide formation in molten zinc. In the next step, the dried sheets are kept inside the molten zinc for 25-40 minutes. This hot dipping forms a layer on both side of the steel sheet. The liquid zinc bonds to the iron in the steel forming a protective layer on both sides of the sheet. This process makes the sheet corrosion resistant. After this, colour coating is done over sheets as per the requirement in colorings plant. In the next step, sheets are fed into corrugated steel sheet machine. This machine has an arrangement of successive pressure rolls that forms the corrugated layer over the surface of the sheet. The sheet is fed by the rollers in the forward direction. After this, the sheets are cut along its length at the end of machine by a cutter suitably arranged in the machine. In the next step, the sheets are quality tested for the desired working performance. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 - 2500Sqft. MACHINES: 1. Cupola Furnace – The furnace is used to heat the solid metals to liquefy them by raising the temperature of inner surroundings to the desired melting temperature. 2. Corrugated Steel Sheet making Machine – This machine consists of an arrangements of successive pressure rolls, flute rolls series of rollers that deformed the sheet to the corrugated structure.

EQUIPMENTS: Pickling Tanks – These tanks are used to store acid for pickling process. Sheets are dipped inside these tanks. Suitable valve arrangements are there for emptying the tanks. (https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/frp-pickling-tanks- 20242186230.html) Pumps – Pumps are used to transfer water into the tanks as per the requirement. (https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/water-pump-4697260155.html)

Galvanized Tanks – These tanks are used to store the molten zinc for galvanizing process. Power Requirement – The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 35 – 50 k Wh. Manpower Requirement – There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 – 12 including 2-3 machine operators, 2-3 helpers, and 2 – 3 office staffs and remaining quality engineers.

Project on Artificial denture, teeth, crowns & bridges and allied items (A) INTRODUCTION: Dentures, or false teeth, are fixed or removable replacements for teeth. Tooth replacement becomes necessary when the tooth and its roots have been irreparably damaged, and the tooth has been lost or must be removed. Dentists have long known that a missing permanent tooth should always be replaced or else the teeth on either side of the space gradually tilt toward the gap, and the teeth in the opposite jaw begin to move toward the space. There are several standard forms of tooth replacement in modern dentistry. A full denture is made to restore both the teeth and the underlying bone when all the teeth are missing in an arch. A smaller version is the fixed partial denture, also known as a fixed bridge, which can be used if generally healthy teeth are present adjacent to the space where the tooth or teeth have been lost. The partial is anchored to the surrounding teeth by attachment to crowns, or caps, that are affixed to the healthy teeth. A removable partial denture is used to replace multiple missing teeth when there are insufficient natural teeth to support a fixed bridge. This device rests on the soft tissues of the jaws, and is held in place with metal clasps or supports. Dental implants are the latest tooth-replacement technology. They allow prosthetic teeth to be implanted directly in the bones of the jaw. The proposed project is meant to manufacture Artificial Teeth, Dentures and Allied items like Crowns, Bridges & Dowel Pins etc. In addition to looks, health consciousness and awareness about the utility of artificial teeth in case of teeth fall and removal due to some medical problems has made the use of artificial teeth & dentures more popular in the present times. The unit will also run a research clinic along with the production of above mentioned to keep themselves current with the prevailing problems of the patients and to find out the solutions to the patients requirement. (B) MARKET POTENTIAL: The global dental market is growing at a rate of CAGR 5% in the last five years with the Asian markets showing highest growth of 10% followed by the US at almost half the rate of 5.5% With over 5000 dental laboratories, 297 dental institutes, the Indian dental market is vast and it is predicted that India will be the single largest country market for dental products and materials. The dental market is expected to have a growth rate of 20 to 30 percent, with investment groups building multispecialty hospitals offering general dentistry and specialist treatments. The current

dentist to population ratio in urban area is 1:9000 and in rural areas it is 1:200000. The value of dental equipment and laboratories market itself is about US$ 90 million annually. In the last decade the dental services scenario in India has vastly improved due to:  Growing Healthcare Awareness Better Economic Growth  Increased Healthcare Expenditure  Investor friendly Government Policies  Reduction on Customs Duty A large portion of dental products are imported into the country. About 85% of India’s annual requirement is supplied by Germany, USA, Italy, Japan and China. Most of the imports are in the implants segment. Foreign companies are investing in the Indian dental equipment market by establishing their production units in India. India is rapidly becoming a manufacturing hub for supplying dental equipment and material to less developed countries such as Pakistan, Africa, Sri Lanka and parts of the Middle East. . Oral Care Infrastructure 99% of the dental market in India is private. Most practices in India are Solo with multi- operations. Several large multi national players such as Apollo Group, Wockhardt, Fortis are setting up a chain of dental clinics to tap into this rapidly growing dental market. Over 90% of the dentists work in and around major cities. As job opportunities in both the public and private sector are relatively less, most dentists set up their own private clinic. Every year approx. 12,000 to 15,000 new practices start in the country. Dental Laboratory/Dental Technician There is a greater demand than supply of dental technicians in India. Currently there are about 5000 dental laboratories yet only 32 colleges which offer diploma courses for the post of a dental technician. More colleges are now offering the course to match the growing demand. (C) BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: Efficiency & working hours considered 8 hours.

(E) TECHNICAL ASPECTS: Modern technology has offered considerable advances in the materials used to make artificial teeth and improved techniques for affixing them in the mouth. Synthetic plastic resins and lightweight metal alloys have made teeth more durable and natural looking. Better design has resulted in dentures that provide more comfortable and efficient chewing. In the 1980s technology was developed to create the next generation of dentures, which are permanently anchored to the bones in the jaw. These new dentures, known as dental implants, are prepared by specialized dentists called denturists. Raw Materials Teeth Most artificial teeth are made from high quality acrylic resins, which make them stronger and more attractive than was once possible. The acrylic resins are relatively wear-resistant, and teeth made from these materials are expected to last between five and eight years. Porcelain is also used as a tooth material because it looks more like natural tooth enamel. Porcelain is used particularly for upper front teeth, which are the most visible. However, the pressure of biting and chewing with porcelain teeth can wear away and damage natural teeth. Therefore, porcelain teeth should not be used in partial dentures where they will contact natural teeth during chewing. Mounting frame Artificial teeth are seated in a metal and plastic mount, which holds them in place in the mouth during chewing. The mount consists of a frame to provide its form and a saddle-shaped portion that is shaped to conform to the patient's gums and palate. This design allows for comfort and optimizes the dentures' appearance. Frames are typically constructed of metal alloys such as nobilium or chromium. The latest generations of plastic materials used in dentures are virtually indestructible and can be easily adjusted or repaired with a special kit at the dentist's office. These materials are also ultra lightweight and can eliminate problems in patients who are allergic to acrylic materials or who are bothered by the metallic taste left by a metal frame.

Design Every individual's mouth is different, and each denture must be custom designed to fit perfectly and to look good. The latest methodology used in denture design, known as dentogenics, is based on research conducted in Switzerland in the early 1950s, which developed standards for designing teeth to fit specific smile lines, mouth shapes, and personalities. These standards are based on such factors as mouth size and shape, skull size, age, sex, skin color, and hair color. For example, through proper denture design, patients can be given a younger smile by simply making teeth longer than they normally would be at that patient's age. This rejuvenation effect is possible because a person's teeth wear down over time; slightly increasing the length of the front teeth can create a more youthful appearance. Manufacturing Process Out-line :- CROWNS & BRIDGES Before duplicating, the master cast it is disinfected with U. V. chamber & autoclave all the instruments. Prepare the master cast by duplicating the model with silicone gel material in borosil duplicating flask. See all the undercut by surveyor. The abutment teeth should be parallel to each other. This is done by surveying instrument. Design the master cast with marker. Wax pattern is made on the master cast with inlay wax. Now wax pattern cast is fixed in the sprue former or casting ring. Mix the silica bonded investment material with bowl and spatula and pore the sprue former. Now the casting ring is placed in casting furnace. Here the inlay wax is completely burn out and it is converted into gas. Without losing its temperature it is transfer into INDUCTION CASTING MACHINE. Where 0 wironium metal is melted at temperature 1326 C and it is transferred to sprue former at 0 temperature 1430 C without losing its temperature with in fraction of seconds in the sprue former or casting rings. The fuel used for melting the metal is oxygen gas and LPG After cooling the casting ring it is transfer in the sand blaster machine here the investment material is broken with sand blaster with the use of air compressor. If any curing metal porosity is detected then it is corrected with laser Welding or SPOT welding. Now the casted metal is cut with high speed grinder. Finish it with small diamond burs with hanging engine then it is prepare 0 for porcelain furnace. Firstly heat the metal in the vacuum furnace at 300 C to oxidized the metal surface then opaque material is apply on the surface metal. Now porcelain is mixed with 3 D master to match the shade of the tooth. Apply the porcelain on the casted metal with porcelain brushes. Then it is fired in the porcelain 0 furnace at 600 C. Voltage stabilizer controls the voltage with in limit which is used in porcelain

0 furnace and air conditioner (AC). Precaution – porcelain should kept under 15 - 25 C and dry place up to its use. Now the Mattel porcelain crown and bridge or metallic denture is prepared it is finish with micro motor green stone diamond burs and with porcelain burs kits then it is polish with silicones polisher packed and deliver to the dental clinics . PROCES OF FLEXIBLE DENTURE For flexible denture the duplicating designing surveying and pre heating are same, after burring of wax flexible denture material is mix in depends reach it at dough stage then it is packing in the 0 flasks ring then it is placed in the flexible denture machine. It is cured at 45 C from 0 to 2 hours, then it is cool finished with micro motor , polished with acrylic polishing unit, packed and deliver to the dental clinic. PROCESS OF TEETH MANUFACTURING Wax teeth are prepared in the die. Fix the wax teeth in POP in flask. De-waxing is done by heating in boiling water. Wash it with hot water then pack with white acrylic polymer at dough 0 stage. Again boil it from 0 to 20 minute at temperature from 0 to 95 C. Then cool it with tap water. De-flasking is done remove teeth from the POP. Finished with the micro motor and polished with acrylic polisher unit then tested, stored and packed for marketing.

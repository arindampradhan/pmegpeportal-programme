DISPOSABLE PLASTIC SYRINGE INTRODUCTION Syringe is a device composed of a plunger-cylinder arrangement in which, the working side of plunger is attached to a nozzle through which the fluid is sucked in or forced out under effect of pressure gradient which is positive in case of fluid pumping and negative in case of fluid suction, which is generated by means of plunger which leads out of the cylinder. The syringe is used for sucking or injecting a fluid under pressure hence the device has laboratory and medical applications, in laboratory it’s used to inject metered quantity of chemical into an object for study like fruit, vegetable, microbe colony etc. or to extract samples from liquid substance. In medical field the device is used for variety of applications like cleaning wounds, injecting medicine into blood stream and extracting body fluid samples.

Figure 1.1 Parts of Syringe The parts of syringe include Barrel, Plunger (Plunger Top, Plunger Shaft, Plunger Head & Plunger Seal) and Nozzle, if the syringe is to be used injecting or sucking fluid from within any body, then the needle attachment is used which includes Needle Adapter, Needle Hub, Needle Shaft, Needle Cover and Bevel. The barrel generates operational or work volume of syringe thus ultimately holds the fluid to be extracted or injected; Plunger functionally constrains and controls the work volume, it’s composed of four parts plunger top which receives the force from user without causing much discomfort and transfers it to plunger shaft, which in turn transfers this force to plunger head efficiently, the plunger head converts the applied force into positive or negative pressure so as to inject or suck fluid respectively via nozzle and plunger seal prevent any significant leakage via clearance of plunger and barrel; the nozzle is inbuilt within the barrel due to their manufacturing process and it simply converts pressure head into velocity head so as to obtain a jet of fluid at time of injection and visa-versa at time of suction to obtain a gradual influx within work volume. The syringe can be made out of many materials like Aluminum, Steel, Different Plastics etc. each having its own special application, advantage and limitation; this work only emphasizes disposable plastic syringe which are excessively used in medical field for drug injection and body fluid sample extraction.

Stainless Steel Syringe Aluminum Syringe Plastic Syringe Figure 1.2 Types of Syringe Disposable Plastic Syringe is a class of syringe made from plastic and designed for single use, these type syringe are widely used by medical professionals because single time use prevents transmission of any bacteria, fungus, virus, other parasites and blood strain to enter the patient’s body because though the sanitization and sterilization are effective way to dissolve the outer membrane and thus kill the pathogen but, genetic material still lingers which can cause mutation of other non-pathogenic microbes into pathogenic strains.

1. Raw Material What actually makes the syringe disposable is its low manufacturing cost which can only be derived from mass production of product and cheap raw material which in case of disposable plastic syringes is Polyethylene and Polypropylene mostly. For a complete module of disposable plastic syringe the raw material required are: 1) High Purity Polyethylene (PE) or Polypropylene (PP) Pellets Polyethylene Polypropylene Figure 2.1 Plastic Pellets 2) Stainless Steel Needle Tube Figure 2.2 Syringe Needle 3) Ink for graduation scale printing and package printing 4) Medical Grade Syringe Rubber Seal Figure 2.3 Syringe Rubber Seal 5) Additives (Stabilizers, Plasticizers etc.) 6) Packaging Material

2. Machine Required The manufacturing process employed are Mixing, Grinding, Injection Moulding, Printing and Packaging thus machine required are: 1) Tube Cutting Machine 2) Tube Grinding Machine 3) Honing Machine 4) Water Jet Cleaner 5) Mixer with Heating and Cooling Arrangement 6) Weighing Machine 7) Grinder 8) Injection Moulding machine 9) Moulds of Barrel, Plunger, Needle Cover and Needle Adapter 10) Graduation Printing Machine 11) Syringe Assembly Machine 12) Sterilization Chamber 13) Packaging machine 3. Manufacturing Process The Needle tubes are feed to Tube Cutting Machine which cuts the needle tube into the size of the needles of syringe followed by which these tubes are feed to a Honing Machine in order to enhance their surface finish; followed by which tubes are feed to grinding machine which grinds a small section of needles at an angle generating bevel; then they are cleaned in a water jet cleaner followed by which they are sent to assembly area.

The PP or PE pellets along with various additives are weighed using a weighing machine and feed to mixer in metered quantities, which has an inbuilt heating mechanism to melt various raw materials into their semi-solid states followed by which it mixes these reagents with raw material so as to obtain plastic mixture required for moulding. This plastic is then cooled to its solid state and plastic solid is internally feed to a grinder which makes small pellets of this plastic which are then feed to Injection Moulding Machine after mounting respective mould in it. The Injection Moulding machine generates various plastic parts which include barrel with nozzle, needle adapter, needle cover and plunger from their respective prepared plastic pellets utilizing appropriate moulds, by melting these pellets into semi-solid state and reforming them back into shape of the mould, followed by cooling them to obtain the parts. The barrel is then sent to Graduation Printing Machine which prints the scale of volume on it followed by which barrel along with all parts are taken to assembly area where all the parts of syringe are assembled. For assembling usually a Syringe Assembly Machine is used which fits all the parts into their respective orientation and location so as to obtain a finished syringe, the separate machine for assembly of individual modules are also available like Needle Module Assembly Machine, Plunger Seal Assembly Press and Plunger Barrel Assembly Machine, but a Syringe Assembly Machine is most advisable as it reduces probability of defect. The manufactured syringe is then feed to sterilization chamber which essentially sterilizes the syringes followed by which, they are checked for quality and then they are feed to Packaging machine which packs them into individual packs followed by which they are filled in carton boxes and sent for sale.

MARKET POTENTIAL The advent of Corona Virus, AIDS, serum Hepatitis and other dreaded infectious diseases have added now dimension and this let to rapid increased use of disposable syringes in developing countries. Use of disposable syringes is fast catching in India also and therefore offers good scope. In view of this, the new units will not face any problems in marketing their product in future. Disposable syringe has a wide market potential. The age-old glass syringes are very fast becoming obsolete. In the Eastern region of the country there is no unit manufacturing this product. Some of the units manufacturing this product are in other parts of the country. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE NATURE OF ACTIVITIES ESTIMATED PERIOD 1.

THERMAL SCANNER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Non-Contact IR Thermal scanner is specially used to measure the body temperature of a person regardless of room temperature. Depending on various skin types and thickness, there may be a temperature difference. Infrared (IR) thermal scanners are available in range of contactless thermal scanners that determine a temperature from the amount of thermal radiation emitted from an object. This device works by focusing thermal radiation on a sensor. To realize the human body temperature fast and non-contact measurement, an infrared thermal scanner is designed. The infrared human body temperature sensor is mainly used to convert the human body's infrared radiation into voltage signal, an operational amplifier to amplify the signal, filter circuit to filter the signal, the analog signal into a digital signal by the A/D conversion circuit, data processing by the MCU, LCD, display so the human body non-contact measurement is realized.

Uses & Market Potential: Thermal scanners are used to measure temperature quickly, at a distance, and without touching the object you're measuring. They are so useful and easy to operate. Non- contact thermal scanners has a gun-shaped design and fits easily into the grip of hands. Due to its quick reading feature, it is ideal for both domestic and professional use. The thermal scanner market size is expected to grow by USD 1.85 billion during the period 2020- 2024. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has driven different companies, hospitals, airline companies, Offices, Schools, Colleges, and Hotels to adopt several precautionary measures, such as the use of thermal scanners for inspecting customers, employees, students, workers, passengers’ body temperature and disinfecting the particular surroundings. One of the primary growth drivers for this market is the Demand from Airports for Passengers Screening. Airports are increasingly implementing security procedures at various checkpoints to reduce the spread of infect ious diseases. Hence, the increasing prevalence of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 is expected to fuel the demand for thermal scanners from crowded places for a person’s temperature screening. The main advantage of being a non-contact object, there is a lesser chance of passing on the infection or germs from one person to another. Hence the demand for non-contact thermometers are increasing. Product: Thermal Scanner

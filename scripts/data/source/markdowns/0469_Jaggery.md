Jaggery Extraction Unit INTRODUCTION Sugar industry in India is a well-developped industry and one of the largest after textiles. It provides rural employment opportunities and plays an important role in Indian economy. Jaggery is also manufactured from sugarcane juice and is very widely used not only in individual households but also in many eateries, restaurants, clubs and hostels and it has certain industrial applications as well. Manufacture of sugar involves many technical aspects and the capital investment is also on the higher side. Compared to this, production of jiggery is very simple and the capital cost is also very limited. Due to its wide applications, the market for jaggery is continuously growing. PRODUCTS Jaggery is a typical Indian product with several uses in daily food preparations and it is also used to make many sweet food preparations. This is a product with scattered market and can be manufactured in the states like Maharashtra, UP, Gujarat, Bihar, Jharkhand etc. MARKET POTENTIAL The demand for jaggery is steadily growing many folds in the urban, rural and semi-urban areas. There are several applications of jaggery and almost all Indian households use it on day-to-day basis. Market for jaggery is round the year whereas its production is only during the sugarcane season and thus factory works for around 6 to 7 months every year. Apart from individual households, it is used in large quantities in restaurants, road-side dhabas, other eateries, hostels and clubs and by caterers. It has shelf-life of more than couple of months. Its production is undertaken at several places but Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu are the leading manufacturers. In view of constantly growing market, MANUFACTURING PROCESS it should not be difficult for a new entrant to enter and capture the market. Jaggery manufacturing is done on a small scale by a group of farmers. The juice is extracted from fresh sugarcane. Then it is filtered and boiled in wide, shallow iron pans with continous

stirring and, simultaneously soda or bhindi juice is added in required quantity. While boiling,brownish foams come at the top which are continuously removed to get golden yellow colour of jaggery. The consistency of the juice becomes thick and then it is poured into the small to medium sized iron or aluminum cans where blocks of jaggery are formed after cooling. Size of the blocks can vary from 1 kg. to 12 kgs. Finally, these blocks are packed in gunny bags. From 100 kgs. of sugarcane, 10 kgs. of jaggery is made. The process flow chart is as under: • • Juice Extraction • Filtration and Boiling Cooling and Packing The main raw material is sugarcane with minimum 19.0 Brix reading. The extraction of juice from the sugarcane works out to about 45%. The states of Bihar and Jharkhand produce large quantity of sugarcane and availability should not be a bottleneck. Other materials like soda/bhindi juice shall be available locally. Gunny bags of different capacity shall be the packing material. CLARIFICATION OF JUICE : • The sugar juice contains colloidal matter, inorganic salts, fiber, various nitrogenous substances, lipids, gums, wax organic acid, inorganic acid, pectin etc. All these impurities • removed totally or partially in this clarification process. . In In the clarification process generally used two types of clarificants are used they are Organic Clarificants and Inorganic Clarificants organic clarificants are form

In this process temperature requirement is 70 C to 80 First added vegetable origin simultaneously small quantity of lime water is added to reduce the acidity of juice but not to the extent to make juice neutrals because taste and colour of gur produced will be inferior. In this lime process p H maintained 6.2 to 6.5. In 2 5, some cases super phosphate. P O and 0.25% concentrated hydrous power are also added to obtain good colour of Gur (jaggey). While juice temperature rising scum is removed by perforated strainers. CONCENTRATION OF JUICE : After clarification completed by vigorous boiling, temperature of boiling mass is around 110 o to 115 Boiling take place about 2 to 3 hours. The stage at which semi fluid material is formed then it is transferred rectangular boxes or Bucket shape boxes as per requirement. This mass is allowed to cool for solid form. COMPOSITION AND SPECIFICATION OF JAGGERY (GUR) : • It contains all the nutrients and substances present in cane juice. The nutrient value of jaggery is slightly higher than that of crystalline sugar because it contains all • constituents which are normally separated in molasses in manufacturing of sugar. Recovery of jaggery in the range from 8 to 12% that depending upon the total solids in • cane. Jaggery graded in the market according to basis of colour, taste, hardness and crystalinity which is judged by visual appearance. While in practically graded of jaggery should be consider sucrose %, reducing sugar, moisture and colour. STORAGE OF JAGGERY: Jaggery is consumed throughout the year in daily regular practice. The jaggery detoriates faster in monsoon season when relative humidity is more than 70%. During this season gur absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and becomes viscous and dark colour. Hence jaggery blocks packed in gunny bags along with water proof sheet.

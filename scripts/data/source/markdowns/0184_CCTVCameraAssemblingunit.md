CCTV CAMERA ASSEMBLY UNIT Introduction: Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point-to-point (P2P), point to-multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links. Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, stores, and other areas where security is needed. Though video telephony is seldom called 'CCTV' one exception is the use of video in distance education, where it is an important tool. Advantages of CCTV Camera: The CCTV surveillance system has brought in a revolution in protecting homes and other commercial spaces. With their varied uses and countless benefits, you can see them in almost all places today. Few of CCTV camera benefits include:

CCTV surveillance Market Analysis: According to “India CCTV Camera Market Outlook, 2021”, the India CCTV Camera market is expected to grow with a CAGR of more than 26 % in the period from 2016 to 2021. Technology wise non-IP dominates the Indian market but in the coming years IP is expected to take the lead soon. Non -IP technology constitutes of analog and HD CCTV cameras. Analog is technology which is in a depleting stage and it share is expected to be taken by the IP technology and the HD type CCTV camera. Dome typed cameras are the most widely used cameras in any sectors. Commercial segment is the driver of the CCTV market in India with the increasing count of SOHO’s and SME’s. With the increasing security concerns, residential sector would also be one of the factors for the increasing market. As criminal activities are more in the northern region of India, North dominates the market in terms of revenue. Components used for CCTV Camera: Different types of components are used for assembling of CCTV Camera.  Body  PCB + IR Kit with lenses.  3 types of Screw

 Piles  IP cable  IP pin connector. Description of Equipment’s: As such no machinery is required for CCTV camera assembly unit, only some tools are required to combine the components of the CCTV camera & convert it into the finished products. Following equipments are required:  CCTV Cable Stripper  Cable Crimping tool  Ethernet Crimper tool  CCTV Camera tester etc.  Other hand tools and equipments This project is based on IP Camera. A growing branch in CCTV is internet protocol cameras (IP cameras). IP cameras use the Internet Protocol (IP) used by most Local Area Networks (LANs) to transmit video across data networks in digital form. IP can optionally be transmitted across the public internet, allowing users to view their cameras through any internet connection available through a computer or a phone, this is considered remote access. The average cost for all equipments will be Rs. 2 Lac. Assembly Process: 1. Procurement of raw material and checking of parts. 2. After that all parts like CCTV camera, PCB circuit, socket, switch etc. are assemble which is known as mounting process. 3. After mounting process inter Connecting of parts is done. 4. Checking of CCTV Quality after linking of components. 5. Packaging of goods.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1200Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 1 Lac. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 5 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 7 including 1 Technical operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

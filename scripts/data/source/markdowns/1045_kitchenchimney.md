1. INTRODUCTION A chimney is fitted right above the cooking appliance. When turned on it sucks the oil, smoke, steam, odor generated during cooking. Chimneys technical name is extractor hood consists of three main components: a capture panel to contain the rising gases, one or more oil collectors or grease filters (depends upon the type of chimney), and a fan of tangential blower for forced ventilation. The oil gets trapped into the oil collectors and the odor, smoke, steam, and heat are thrown out of the kitchen through the duct. A chimney provides ventilation for hot gases or smoke from a cooking pan to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are used to remove the grease and smoke straight from the pan to the outside so that it doesn’t react with the walls and kitchen furniture and . leaves the greasy layer on the same which normally happens when one uses the exhaust fan

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Chimney, also known as a kitchen hood, is referred to as an appliance that absorbs fumes/smoke produced in the kitchen. Built-in hobs, on the other hand, are the gas stovetops that are permanently installed on the kitchen counter surface. Chimney and built-in hobs are both among the popular additions in modular kitchens due to their ability to keep the kitchen clean, along with enhancing the look and décor of the kitchen. The Indian kitchen chimney market attained a value of USD 1.3 billion in the year 2020 and is expected to attain USD 2.74 billion by 2026, which is expected to aid the growth of the market in the country. The main objective is to keep the kitchen air clean so that it doesn’t become difficult to breathe and cause suffocation. The Indian kitchens back in the day were very hazardous to health given to their design. The women working in those kitchens very often suffered from respiratory disorders due to constant exposure. Many households still manage with exhaust fans which are meant for the bathrooms and the difference is only felt after installing a chimney. Thus, safety and well-being are of paramount importance. The modern chimneys have a variety of designs and concepts to choose from depending on customers' styles and requirements. PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL ➢ Metal: SS metal sheets are used to form chimney hope or housing. ➢ Electrical Components: Resistors, Capacitors, Crystal oscillator, Diodes, Transformer, Transistors, Connectors, Power Cords, Relay, Buzzer, Heat sink, Wires, Switches ICs, Motion sensor, Led bulb, Customized circuit board, etc. ➢ Motor and Blower: BLDC motor can be used in chimneys. This motor has a longer life, it produces low heat, and it creates lower noise. The blower pulls air in from the kitchen and forces it through a channel on the exterior. ➢ Plastic: ABS, PC, etc. types of plastic granules can be used to form some plastic parts for the chimney. ➢ Filters- Baffle filter, Mesh filter, and Carbon filters are three types of filters that can be used in the chimney. The polluted air first enters the primary filter which removes the oil droplets. Then the air moves through the carbon filter which eliminates bad odors, smoke and humid air. These Filter can also be made at the manufacturing plant.

PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Commercial vehicle are always under heavy duty operating conditions and therefore require more frequent servicing and repair needs of major and minor viz axle repair, leaf springs, bushings and engine repairs like valve repair, cylinder, injection system, etc. A specialized repair station can be established by experienced entrepreneurs or qualified persons, with low investment. 3. DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROMOTER: The promoter with experience heavy commercial vehicle maintenance will be having good scope to invest in such a project. 4. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK/TREND India’s passenger vehicles population of around 29 million during 2015 is expected to grow to more than 48 million vehicles by 2020. Also, domestic sales of commercial vehicles are expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.6% from 0.6 million in 2015 to more than 2 million by 2026.

of goods without any hindrance throughout the country will lead to growth of goods carrier to satellite cities and rural hubs that will further aided the growth of the sector. The trend in goods and passenger transport industry to rely on better maintained and good riding quality for buses, while multiple variants of Long trailors and very HCV (heavy Commercial Vehicles) to LCV and mini and micro LCV to transport goods indicate the need for large no of commercial vehicles repair and service center demand. 5. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES. IF ANY: The overall Vehicle (PV) segment has 14 per cent market share. Production of passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three wheeler and two wheeler grew at 5.41 per cent in FY17 to 25,316,044 vehicles from 24,016,599 vehicles in FY16. The sales of passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles and two wheeler grew by 9.23 per cent, 4.16 per cent and 6.89 per cent respectively, during the period April-March 2017. With the increasing automobile demand, the country is also proportionately expected to witness a surge in sheet metal products used to manufacture these vehicles. Considering the economic growth and increased trade due to GST introduction the frequency of goods transport directly to end customers shall increase and the no of commercial vehicles plying the road will increase. A good repair station can also tie up with goods and heavy vehicle OEM to be an authorized service station. Also tie ups with fleet owners viz transport operators for regular inspection and servicing for preventive maintenance will be a better business model. 6. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The service station shall require mostly consumables like lubes, grease, welding consumables and servicing requirements and spares as raw materials.

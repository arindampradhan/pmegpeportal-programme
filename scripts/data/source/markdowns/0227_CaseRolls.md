MACHINE AND EQUIPMENT 1. Mixer 2. Injection Moulding Machine 3. PU Foam Mixing and Filling Machine 4. Sheet Metal Blanking Press 5. Deep Drawing Hydraulic Press 6. Oven 7. Various moulds for injection moulding and Puff expansion, other ancillary equipment’s. MANUFACTURING PROCESS All the raw material is procured from vendor and stored in raw material inventory as per production demand. Steel pot and plastic parts are produced simultaneously and are stored in “in-process inventory”. The Plastic parts which include base, outer wall, grip handle ring, lid top and lid base are manufactured from poly propylene. The PP granules along with various additives like stabilizers, accelerators, colour pigment etc; are feed to mixer in required quantities. The batch obtained from mixing is feed to injection moulding machine via its Hooper and feeder arrangement, followed by which machine melts the mix to a semi-solid state utilizing its heaters. This semi-solid material is injected into mould of plastic part to be produced, followed by which the injection moulding machine utilizes its chilling unit to cool the mould and solidify the part. The metal part which in this case is the metal pot, is drawn from Circular SS Sheet Piece in a deep drawing press, this circular piece is obtained from a blanking press which shears the required circular plate out of the metal sheet. After all the parts are obtained the lid and bottom pot are manufactured separately, for bottom pot base is initially placed in the PUF mould in its respective position followed by which, required quantity of PUF liquid is mixed and poured in the base followed by which quickly wall and other

accessory plastic part are quickly placed and the mould is closed. The mould is feed to oven where it’s maintained at required temperature ranging from 45 to 60 degree Celsius over a considerable duration of time as required for proper expanding of foam, followed by which mould is opened and case roll pot is extracted from mould. Similarly, the a separate PUF mould is used for lid, initially lid top is placed in the PUF mould in its respective position followed by which, required quantity of PUF liquid is mixed and poured in it, followed by which bottom is quickly placed and the mould is closed. The mould is feed to oven where it’s maintained at required temperature ranging from 45 to 60 degree Celsius over a considerable duration of time as required for proper expanding of foam, followed by which mould is opened and case roll lid is extracted from mould. The completed case roll lid and pot are checked for quality manually assembled and sent for sale.

PROJECT PROFILE ON BARBED WIRE MANUFACTURING UNIT INTRODUCTION Barbed wire is a useful industrial product, mainly used for fencing purposes. Barbed wire fencing prevents the unwanted entrance and intrusion of animals and persons into the fenced area. Barbed wire production business can be initiated as small and medium scale basis with a comparatively small startup capital investment. The galvanized barbed wire is classified into three categories; Classes I, II, and III. Class I has the thinnest coating and the shortest life expectancy. A wire with Class I coating will start showing general rusting in 8 to 10 years while the same wire with Class III coating will show rust in 15 to 20 years. The aluminum-coated wire is occasionally used and yields a longer life. MARKET DEMAND This is mainly used to safeguard houses, gardens, forests, nurseries and specified prohibited areas pertaining to defense establishment, aerodromes, railways, warehouses and other Govt. and Private properties. They are also used to make and safeguard international boundaries and are one of the cheapest materials to be used for these various purposes. Looking to the specific but important use of the product, product has demand all over the country to protect the field / property from various external elements.

The Galvanized Wire has very good demand for its versatile use in different applications. There is a large demand for this item from the downstream industries. With the availability of appropriate technology, the activity is highly feasible in the small scale sector and marketing is generally not a problem. PRODUCTION TARGETS Basis of estimation: 300 Working Days in a Year Single Shift basis 8 hours per shift Barbed Wire Quantity (MT) 600 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The barbed wires are made on an automatic machine. The barbed wire is made out of 12/14 SWG MS Galvanized wires. While two main line wires are fed into the machines through its axes another wire is fed across into the pair of line wires to form barbs at required intervals. The line wire twine themselves automatically the point wire after forming the desired barbs strands with the line wires automatically at the desired distance thus forming the complete barbed wire. As the machine is automatic all its feeding and wire cutting mechanism is controlled by gear movements. The machine is powered through an electric motor attached to the machine. Once the machine is set up as per the desired settings it goes on working automatically.

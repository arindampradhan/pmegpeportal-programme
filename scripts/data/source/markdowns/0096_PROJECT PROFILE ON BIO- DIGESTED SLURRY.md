## Page 1

"KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON BIO- DIGESTED SLURRY Introduction : The biogas technology is attributed with dual benefits in the form of supply of clean and high calorific fuel to meet the domestic fuel needs of rural areas and provision of anaerobicaly digested slurry with high manurial value. In addition to this, it is known to reduce the pathogenic load of night soil at a Substantial level when toilets are attached to the biogas plants. Hence, it is an eco-friendly technology helping to reduce the destruction of forests by offering a fuel alternative to wood at the doorstep of the house and accuring a social benefit in way of alleviation of the drudgery of women in collectionof firewoodandcooking. Itisalsoanenvironmentallysound technologyas itprovides asafe method for disposal of organic waste preventing spread of diseases and controlling pollution. Considering all these attributes together, the nutrient recovery through anaerobic digestion in biogas plantrepresentsamoreeconomicandefficientoptioninobtaininggoodqualitymanureforourfarming system. 1 Name of the Product : Bio Digested Slurry 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.mtsrented 1000 Rs. 200,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 1,875,000.00 Bio Gas Plant 85 Cumt Capacity (3 Plants), Shovel for Mixing, Sieving Machine, Cutter & Blender, Sewing Machine, Drying bed of Size 20' x 10' x 3' Total (20 nos) Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 2,075,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 400,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 2,475,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in 000) Sr. No. Particulars Capacity in No./annum Rate Total Value 1 Bio Gas & Bio Manure 85000.00 2040.00 2577.50 TOTAL 85000.00 2040.00 2577.50 4 Raw Material : Rs. 7 65,000.00 5 Labels and Packing Material : Rs. 5 0,000.00 6 Wages (5-Skilled & 15 Un Skilled) : Rs. 1 ,000,000.00 7 Salaries 1- Manager/ Enterprenure R s . 1 :20,000.00

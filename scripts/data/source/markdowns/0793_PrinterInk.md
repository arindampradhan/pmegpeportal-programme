PRINTER INK MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The manufacturing of printing ink enjoys an important place in chemical industry. With the growing demand of a wide spectrum of printing inks and with the advancement of printing processes, the industry offers entrepreneurs the opportunity for career development. Ink is a liquid or paste that contains pigments or dyes. Pigments give ink its colour and they can come from a variety of sources containing nitrogen compounds – commonly known as dyes. In printers, ink is used to produce copies of digital text or images. Over 90% of inks that are produced are printing ink, in which colour is imparted by pigments rather than the dyes used in writing inks. Ink is made with a combination of ingredients including varnish, resin, solvents, pigments, and additives including waxes and lubricants. Black ink is made using carbon black pigments, and white pigments like titanium dioxide can be used to lighten other ink colours.

Uses & Market Potential: Ink is a gel, sol, or solution that contains at least one colourant, such as a dye or pigment, and is used to color a surface to produce an image, text, or design. Ink is used for drawing or writing with a pen, brush, reed pen, or quill. Thicker inks, in paste form, are used extensively in letterpress and lithographic printing. The printing inks market was valued at USD 16,757.32 million in 2020, and the market is projected to register a CAGR of over 2% during the forecast period (2021-2026). India is among the fast growing printing ink markets globally spurred by the rapid expansion of the domestic print markets. Backed by a strong demand from key end user segments such as package printing, newsprint, publishing and other commercial printing, the printing ink market in India has registered strong growth in the recent years. The printing ink industry is fragmented with over 550 manufacturers and a large number of players in the un- organized sector. Printing ink sector in India is estimated at 4, 10,000 tons for 2021- 22, the market witnessed a growth of around 7.5% per annum during the last 10 years. Printed packaging accounts for around 27% of the demand for printing inks in India followed by newspapers at 20%. Commercial printing/ promotional and printed advertising together account for around 19% of the demand. Product: Printer Ink Raw Material: The raw materials are mentioned below:  Pigments  Binders, extenders and plasticizers

Manufacturing Process: The manufacturing principles apply to the different types of inks (conventional offset inks, UV inks, flexo / gravure inks), involving five essential steps that determine the final properties and performance of the inks. It is therefore useful to be familiar with the main manufacturing parameters and to understand the key steps. The main important goal in ink manufacturing process is to disperse the pigment in a vehicle that can transport the colorant to the substrate . For black news inks, the primary carriers are petroleum oil, soybean oil, or water (for the flexographic printing process). Resins are also introduced to help disperse the pigment and to bind the pigment to the paper after printing. The most obvious role of a pigment is to color the ink. However, pigments can also provide gloss, abrasiveness, and resistance to attack by light, heat, solvents, etc. Special pigments known as extenders and opacifiers are also used. Extenders are transparent pigments which make the colors of other pigments appear less intense, while opacifiers are white pigments, which make the paint opaque so that the surface below the paint cannot be seen. The physical properties of pigments, such as particle size and particle surface, are of great influence in the dispersion process. Primary dispersions for ink production demand that the pigment particles are thoroughly wetted by the liquid phase. The pigment particle size strongly affects the color strength since the smaller particle size has the higher surface area and thus the stronger the color. If this dispersion level is not achieved, printing problems will arise. To achieve the optimum benefits of a pigment, it is necessary to obtain as full a reduction as possible to the primary particle size. The primary feature particle size is 0.5 micron or specific surface area of 30 to 100 m2/g. A number of printing inks are completed in a one or two-step mixing/dispersing process which is usually carried out on a high shear mixer to produce ink with acceptable dispersion.

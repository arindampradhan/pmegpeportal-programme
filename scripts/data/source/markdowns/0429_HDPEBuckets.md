HDPE BUCKETS Introduction: Plastic Buckets have been used in Indian households for over 30 years in every strata of society. The traditional galvanised iron, aluminium and brass buckets have been to a great extent been replaced by HDPE moulded buckets. The important performance characteristics they provide include lightness, unbreakablility, ease in handling, safety in use, resistance to boiling water and chemicals, colour variability to match environment and economical cost. The HDPE Buckets are available in the market ranging from 13.5 litres to 25 litres capacity. However, the bucket having 21 litre capacities is the most popular in the market. Market Potential: In accordance with the Working Group Report on Petrochemicals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, the demand of total HDPE Injection Moulded items including buckets in India is projected to be 1500 Kilo Tonnes by 2020-25 having growth rate @ 16%. However, the moulded buckets and mugs are fast moving items. The growth rate and demand is envisaged on an average 11 – 12 percent per annum.

Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. HDPE Granules 2. Colourant Machinery Requirement: Major machinery and equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Injection Molding Machine 1 2200000 2200000 Compressor 5 Kg Pressure 1 50000 50000 Cooling Tower 1 350000 350000 Scrap Grinder 1 250000 250000 Dry colour mixer 1 200000 200000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 3100000 Manufacturing Process: HDPE Buckets can be moulded on Ram type or Screw type preplasticiser machines. The latter is preferred. The process involves feeding the raw material to the machine through a hopper. The barrel is heated to melt the material, which is injected into the mould halves by the forward movement of the screws into the cavity. The mould cavity is cooled by passage of water at ambient or low temperature to freeze the molten material. The pressure of the screw is held for some time and then it retracts by screw rotation. At the end of the moulding and cooling cycle, the mould halves open and the moulded item is extracted manually or automatically. Thus the entire moulding cycle comprising injection, holding the injection pressure, cooling and the idle time for extracting the moulding is completed.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

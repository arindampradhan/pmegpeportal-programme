THREAD MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Clothing is the basic necessity for humans. Introduction of new fashion is attracting consumers to go for readymade garments which offer designs in line with the latest trends. A continuous improvement in literacy ratio and shift to urban areas also leads to change in clothing preferences with more population opting for readymade garments. Apparel production is another important area in textile manufacturing around the textile industry chain. Probably the apparel is what an individual wear for the purpose of body coverage, beautification, or comfort. Yarn made from a variety of textile fibres is commonly used in sewing, rope making, wire making, knitting, and embroidery. Staple and continuous filament yarns are the two types of yarn. Yarn can be divided into mono- fiber and mixed yarns based on the fabrics used. A thread is a two- or more-yarn string that has been closely twisted. At home, it's used for hand stitching and sewing machines. In commercial and industrial sewing, 95% of sewing threads are used.

Uses & Market Potential: When cut in cross section, thread is a closely woven strand of two or more plys of yarn that is circular. Sewing thread differs from wool in that it is used to stitch clothing or other items together, while yarn is a set of fibres used to weave or knit a textile cloth. Sales of yarn, fibre, and thread by companies (organisations, sole dealers, and partnerships) that produce spinning yarn from fibres, threads for weaving, crocheting, embroidery, and other applications make up the yarn, fibre, and thread manufacturing industry. By 2022, the yarn, fabric, and thread manufacturing industry is estimated to be worth about $123.39 billion, with a CAGR of 8.1 percent over the projected period. The demand for yarn, fibre, and thread production is expanding due to the growth of developing economies, rising disposable income, and technological advancements. Product: THREAD Raw Material: 1. Cotton Fibre 2. Caustic Soda

Manufacturing Process: Cotton Twisting Woving Procurement Cleaning, Combing & Drawing Winding Sorting Fibre Strengthening Spinning Extraction & Finishing Fig. 1 – Process Flowchart Area: The industrial setup requires space for manufacturing unit. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small scale factory setup is 2000- 3000Sq. ft. approximately.

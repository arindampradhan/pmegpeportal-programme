1. INTRODUCTION An envelope is a common packaging item, usually made of thin, flat material. It is designed to contain a flat object, such as a letter or card. Traditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes: a rhombus, a short-arm cross or a kite. An envelope has only two purposes, according to Grant Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Direct, a successful and well-known marketing company. One is to securely carry its contents from origin to destination, and its other purpose. An envelope is a form of packing. Envelopes are used for sending letters or documents using regular postal mail. Envelopes are usually made of paper or hardened paper. An envelope may be small enough to make you need to fold the paper going into it, or it can be as large as the paper so that you do not need to fold it. Used widely in the postal world to send a variety of correspondence such as magazines, brochures, catalos and newspapers, plastic envelopes are an alternate option to shipping these items in rigid cartons or cardboard boxes, and are also known as poly mailers or poly mailer bags.

## Page 5

 Raw Material Procurement: The major raw material you need is craft paper role for producing envelope. First of all, cut the paper into required sizes. Then, feed the cut papers into the envelope making machine in blocks of 150 to 200 sheets depending on the thickness of the paper. The fold and apply glue to form the required envelope. Finally, pack the envelopes and distribute to retail stationery shops. For making fancy envelopes, you may need different types of decorative items like colourful threads, beads, buttons etc  Steps involved in the manufacturing of envelope manufacturing unit:  Preparation of paper die making: Paper is cut according to the specification. The initial step of preparation of paper into required dimension with the help of multiple die shape. Press the die on the blank and get the sheet ready for feeding into the machine  Feeding of raw paper on the automatic machine: The blank paper can be feed into the one end of the machine and the process of marking, pressing and envelope take place take place inside the fully automatic Machine. The need of semi-skilled labour requires for whole the operation. The capacity of machine 8000envelope per hour.  Paste of envelope to get the desired shape using Glue: The molten metal is poured in to the mold through the smaller front Centre hole which fills the mold from bottom back up to the top through the risers, which can be seen as 8 large holes. When the casting is cooling down the molten metal in the riser is drawn back down in to the casting. The risers act a main part in the casting process by supplying required molten envelope pasting take place inside the fully automatic during shrinkage.  Packaging of envelope: The rough aluminum block casting is shown above after the removal of the sand mold. The sand is removed by applying vibrating on the casting. The casting has to be machined to get correct dimensions and smooth surfaces of the engine cylinder.

PLASTIC BARREL MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Plastic barrels are rigid or semi-rigid hollow containers made up of extrusion blow molding process. They are generally used for the shipping and storage of bulk quantities of liquid items. Plastic barrels are considered cost-effective, lightweight, and have a long life, making them an appropriate candidate for storing and shipping non-hazardous and hazardous substances such as liquor, chemicals, particular fertilizer. These drums are made up of commodity plastic such as PP or PE, but the high durability of PE make it suitable material for the fabrication process. PE comes under food-grade materials and provides high inertness along with very high stability to the barrels. Uses & Market Potential: Plastic barrels have a wide range of end-use industry applications such as agriculture, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, households, etc. Plastic barrels

are easy to handle, simple to empty and fill thus, they are appropriate for logistics and transportation. Plastic barrels hold a rightful share in the intermediate bulk containers market. These barrels can be reused nearly 30 times with repeated reconditioning and can be stacked on pallets that efficiently handle the product during shipment. Demand for petrochemicals in all regions is one other reason for boosting the market. It provides UV protection and does not leak easily, making them adequate for industrial, household, and commercial purposes. For specific purposes, plastic barrels can be specifically designed with handles, with strong closures for improved handling and protection of the filling products. The plastic barrels market is set to experience high growth in the upcoming years, as cost- effectiveness of plastic provides ease of accessibility to the consumers. Earlier, large metal barrels were used to ship oil, juice, and other liquid products, but now plastic barrels are steadily replacing other industrial packaging options. Plastic barrels offer several advantages over other materials, such as re-usability and cost-efficiency, leading to their wide range of applications across various regions. Product: Plastic Barrel Raw Material: The raw materials required for the manufacture of the Plastic Barrel are:  HDPE resin (blow molding grade)  Pigments  Antioxidant and other additives

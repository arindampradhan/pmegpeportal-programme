1. INTRODUCTION The cashew apple was given priority over cashew kernel during the initial introduction era due to its wider and attractive spectrum and ready consumption. Cashew apple is a reservoir of minerals and vitamins especially vitamin C and polysaccharides, protein and fiber and hence acts as the best thirst quencher and instant energy supplier to the exhausted travelers. But there are certain limitations such as poor shelf life, susceptible to microbial infection and tannin content which hinders the extensive utility and commercialization of cashew apple and their products. Cashew fruit can be made suitable for consumption by removing the undesirable tannins and processing the apples into value-added products, such as juices, syrups, canned fruits, pickles, jams, chutneys, candy and toffee. The recommended methods for removing the astringent properties of the cashew apple include steaming the fruit for five minutes before washing it in cold water, boiling the fruit in salt water for five minutes or adding gelatin solution to the expressed juice. In gathering the fruits and transporting them to be processed, the prime purpose should be to have the fruit arrive in the very best condition possible. Cashew apples should be sorted and only mature, undamaged cashew apples should be selected for use in recipes. Researchers have also reported the cashew apple juice as a fat burner. It helps to burn more fat, but not carbohydrates. In fact, during exercise, the amount of carbohydrates burned didn’t just go unchanged.

 Production Process: Steps involved in the manufacturing of Cashew Apple Syrup Manufacturing unit The cashew apple syrup is prepared through fermentation and distillation process. Matured and ripened cashew apples are collected, juice extracted, fermented and subjected to the distillation process:  Cashew apples collection: The cashew apple should be properly hygienic cleaning and removal and cutting done in small pieces before extraction of Juice.  Juice Extraction: The juice extraction from cashew apple can be done by size reduction methods as crushing, chopping and comminating.  Fermentation of Juice: Fermented fruit juice is to be produced with the help of yeast. Preservatives are also used in fermented fruit juice making likewise Sulphur-dioxide potassium sorbate, sorbic acid and metabisulphites.  Distillation Process: Distillation, process involving the conversion of a liquid into vapour that is subsequently condensed back to desired product.  Bottling &Packaging: The proper and appropriate bottling along with packaging needed at the end of production line of juice. 3.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Whole bengal gram delivered at the site are first physically cleaned and separated from stone, dust, dirt and other foreign material. Cleaned material is conveyed into soaking- cum-drying bins where it is conditioned with little water and dried by blowing air to loosen its outer skin for separation. This process take about four hours’ time. It is then subjected for spilting outer skin (husk) in a dal mill. The spilt dal is again moisturized and conditioned for four hours. It is then subjected to final milling to extract maximum percentage of flour the final milling is carried out in emery roller machines. Thus obtained flour is further pass through battery of sieving machines to obtained super fine grade and fine grade material. The husk separated is collected from other chutes, whereas other sieved coarse material again feed-back for milling into roller machine. Finally, besan is packed directly in gunny bags, poly- line gunny bags for bulk selling and in laminated pouches or poly-bags for retail selling. 6.

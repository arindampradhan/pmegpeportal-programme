NAMKEEN MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction Namkeen is the Hindi word used to describe a savory flavor. The word namkeen is derived from the word Namak (meaning salt). Namkeen is also used as a generic term to describe savory snack foods. Both black and regular white salt are used in Indian cooking, which gives it the salty flavor many people like. Other namkeen snacks common in Indian cuisine include khaara, farsan, chivda, sav, chips and bhujiya. Namkeen of Indore and Ratlam are two snacks that are very well known for their tastes. Namkeen is a small service of food and generally eaten between meals. Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home. Traditionally, Namkeen are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of preparation. Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks. Namkeen foods are typically designed to be portable, quick, and satisfying. Processed snack foods, as one form of convenience food, are designed to be less perishable, more durable, and more portable than prepared foods. They often contain substantial amounts of sweeteners, preservatives, and appealing ingredients such as chocolate, peanuts, and specially-designed flavors (such as flavoured potato chips). Beverages, such as coffee, are not generally considered snacks although they may be consumed along with or in lieu of snack foods. Ingredients The main ingredients of namkeen are besan, Oil, Sices, packaging material, dal, peanut, potato, dry fruits etc. based on the type of namkeen.

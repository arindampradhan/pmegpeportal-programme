MELAMINE CROCKERY Introduction: Melamine crockery is a hardwearing and extremely damage resistant alternative to porcelain. Melamine formaldehyde is derived from the polymerization of melamine and formaldehyde. It is a hard thermosetting plastic that is a highly versatile synthetic polymer which exhibits a range of properties such as high structural stability, high resistance to heat and fire than that compared to polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride. Melamine crockery is a thermoset plastic resin made from organic compounds. Its physical properties and appearance has made it a popular material for manufacturing hard wearing products across a number of industries. One of the biggest benefits of melamine is that it is hardwearing. Melamine plays an important role in wide range of flame-resistant materials, due to high nitrogen percentage in upholstery fabrics and firemen uniforms, thermal liners, heat resistant gloves and aprons. This report deals with Melamine crockery set comprising of 4 full plates, 6 Quarter plates, 8 Bowls and 12 Spoons. Uses & Market Potential: Melamine formaldehyde finds applications in various industries such as construction, furniture, automobile, textile, paper, electrical and household among others. The construction and furniture industry was the major consumer of melamine formaldehyde in

2012. As it is safe to be dropped and almost impossible to chip or crack during normal use, melamine crockery is ideally suited to bustling semi-formal dining environments and outdoor catering. Because of its superior appearance and quality feel, melamine is the trusted alternative to traditional crockery for many weddings and corporate caterers. The strength of the material, it can be dropped and will rarely break, giving it a distinct advantage over traditional crockery ranges. This remarkable property of melamine crockery makes it the perfect choice for any establishment where accidents might be expected to happen, such as pubs, care homes, schools and hospitals, or even mobile catering units. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Melamine Powder 2. Decal Paper 3. Methanol 4. Packing material Machinery requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Description Qty. Amount 1. Melamine Crockery making 1 2660000 machine 2. Scrap Grinder 1 50000 3. Profile Dies 4 300000 4. Other equipments & hand tools Ls 40000 Total Amount 3050000 Manufacturing Process: At first, the raw material is procured from the authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. The first step is to mix the melamine powder with methanol and water in required composition. The average composition of melamine powder is (40%), water (40%), methanol (20%). The mixture is thoroughly mixed and stirred for 10 -15 minutes and allowed to setup. This mixture is used to coat over the surface of cured article for paper pasting. In the next step, the melamine powder is brought out from the inventory and

weight as per product requirement. The mixture is heated in a baking oven to a temperature of 50°C to remove the moisture content. Place the decal papers on flat plate, use brush to disperse the mixture evenly on each side of papers, which shall then be put at good-ventilation places for drying. In the next step, the profile dies as per the shape requirement of product are mounted precisely in the machine. After this, the baked powder is precisely placed on the die. The machine closes the punch at desired pressure and allowed to come back at normal pressure conditions. This process is called as curing cycle. Almost 70-80% of the article is cured. At this stage surface of the molded article shows no sign of brightness and is soft in nature. In the next step, open up mould and make the side with decal decorated paper on the surface of the article. Re-close mould and return to normal pressure and temperature for 2-3 minutes. Special attention shall be paid to the procedure of degassing, which is generally performed 5-10 seconds after re-close of mold. In the next step, the molded articles are taken out. The burrs and uneven surface is removed using hand grinder or knifes. After this, the articles are quality checked for any defects. The non-uniform pieces are grinded using grinder. After this, the articles are packed and dispatched as per required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1

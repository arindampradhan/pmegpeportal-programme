SOYA PANEER Introduction Soya Milk is an inexpensive and remarkably versatile high protein food made from soyabeans. It is a white liquid made from the seed. Unlike most other protein foods, milk is entirely free from cholesterol and low in fat (specially saturated fats). The quality of protein is as high as that found in chicken. It is also good for dieters as this contain low calories. It is an excellent food for babies, children, elderly people and pregnant and lactating women since it contains vegetable protein which is very nutritious and easy to digest. Soya milk and its derivatives are the cheapest source of protein, its derivatives tofu (soya paneer) makes testy dishes like matar paneer, palak paneer etc. and snacks like soya burger, patties, sand witches, pakoras etc. and also used in desserts. Soya paneer is made from soya milk which is a rich source of high quality proteins and vitamins. Paneer is made by coagulating soya bean milk. It is white & soft. Soya bean is a leguminous crop and is rich in proteins. Many value‐added products are made from it like milk, sauce, paneer etc. Soya products are increasingly becoming popular especially amongst health conscious people. This product has potential in states like Maharashtra, MP, and Gujarat etc. But this note considers Madhya Pradesh as the preferred location. Raw Material Availability The most important raw material will be good quality Soybeans. Total production of soyabeans in MP in year 2004‐05 is 37.47 lakh MT. Dewas district reportedly produces around 3.16 lakh tonnes of Soya beans followed by Ujjain (2.59 lakh MT), Shajapur (2.51lakh MT), Indore (2.31 lakh MT) and Rajgarh (2.3 lakh MT). Citric acid will be required in small quantity. Market Opportunities Soya beans are very nutritious and their acceptance is increasing rapidly. Soya sauce, soya milk and soya bean edible oil are some of the examples. With increasing health awareness, soya‐based products are preferred. Yet another favourable aspect of soya paneer would be its price. As against the price of milk paneer which is in excess of Rs.130/‐ per kg; soya paneer can be offered at half the price. This would be a major

feature. At the same time, it is still a new concept and soya paneer is gradually being accepted by the consumers. Hence adequate marketing efforts coupled with attractive commission to the middlemen shall have to be offered. Nearby semi‐urban and urban locations should be targeted. Project description Applications Paneer is one of the popular milk‐based products. Many vegetarian preparations are made from it. Milk paneer is an established product but it is a costly product. Soya paneer would be an ideal substitute in terms of price as well as nutritious values. Capacity of the Project Rated production capacity of 26 tonnes considering 350 working days is suggested. Manufacturing process Soya bean milk will not be available easily and hence it is contemplated to produce it in‐ house. Good quality soya beans shall have to be cleaned and then soaked in water for around 4 hours. Then they are washed in warm water before grinding them in water. Quantity of water is 7‐8 times more than the beans with some hot water poured in the grinder through a hopper during the process. Grinding time is about 25 minutes. Then the slurry is cooked in grinder‐cum‐cooker for about 3 O minutes at a temperature of around 120 C. Then this slurry is filtered through muslin cloth to obtain soya milk. Small quantity of citric acid is added to the milk and this Cleaning and Soaking of Soya Beans Washing and Grinding Cooking of Slurry Filtration Pressing and Packing

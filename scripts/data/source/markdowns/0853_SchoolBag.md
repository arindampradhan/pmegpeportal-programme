MARKETING & PROMOTION Marketing and promotion are the steps which will decide the quick success of your business. Take extensive steps to promote the business so that every possible client and customer of the school bag knows about your business. These steps can include both online and offline. You can supply to the online shop according to their demand. You can as well create your own website and sell online. Most of the schools, especially the private schools provide school bags to the students. So as an owner of the school bag making business, you can have a contract with any of the educational institute like schools or colleges to supply bags to them. Taking a contract ensures a definite sale of a bulk amount of manufactured bag in every year and helps in getting a free flow of cash to the business. Over that, there are many private companies which provide bags to the employees. So along with educational institutes, private companies also provide a great opportunity of a great market to the business. MANUFACTURING PROCESS The process starts with the identification of cloth and design of bags, collection of material as per design followed by stitching. Bag fabric is mainly cut into three pieces i.e. front, back with top flap, and gusset. The front section is attached with a patch pocket for keeping small articles. Next, all the pieces are stitched in machine with a piping at the pocket, top edges and the sides. Two buckles with straps are provided with the bag. It is neatly finished after fixing stickers, chain, buck lace etc. DETAIL OF EQUIPMENT Brief detail of equipment is as under, however the actual requirement may differ from the list due to various activities associated with the manufacturing process may be carried on manually or through machine S.

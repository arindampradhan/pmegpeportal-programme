PROJECT REPORT ON DHOOP BATTI INTRODUCTION In our Indian society, Dhoop, Dhoop Batti, Agarbatti, all these are taken as synonymous of incense sticks because these are burnt for fragrance. But dhoop or dhoop batti is not same with agarbatti. And the term incense sticks actually refers to agarbatti and not for dhoop batti. Dhoop Batti is prepared from the extracts of the dhoop trees, which are botanically termed as Vateria Indica and Canarium strictum. The dhoop making extracts is collected from the tree by tapping the trees just like in case of rubber. Vateria Indica is the source for saka dhoopa and canarium strictum is the soruce for rala dhoopa. IN market dhoop batti is available not exactly in stick form but as a bit damp paste of combustible material, somewhat similar to pudding but black in colour. Dhoop batti paste is a mixture of ghee, herbs and dhoop tree extracts. These pastes are available in cones or thick sticks. Moreover, now days Dhoop batti are found in various fragrances like panch dham, kesar, nag champa etc. Where as agarbatti is a mixture of powdered wood, charcoal, barks, seeds, leaves, roots, rhizomes, flowers etc. mixed with some essential oil, mineral oil, resins, gums and aromatic chemicals etc. The paste is applied on to a bamboo core stick and dried up. Dhoop batti usually forms more smoke than agarbatti. It is mainly used during ritual ceremonies like havan and all holy occasions. The scent of Dhoop batti is also strong and creates a spiritual mood. The Dhoop trees are mostly found in eastern India. But unfortunately these trees are at the verge of being extinct, because of its heavy deforestation owing to their good market value. 2

MARKET POTENTIAL: The product Dhoopbatti (Incense sticks) is now-a-days becoming very popular in ritual ceremonies like havan etc. In market Dhoopbatti is also sold in bulk quantities. The local vendors do repacking in small quantities. Hence, it is presumed that if this type of unit is set up it will earn good profit. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: 1. The unit will run on three shifts basis of 8 hours per shift for 300 days per year. 2. The unit will run at 60% capacity utilization with 10% increase PA. The cost of land & building, plant & machinery, raw materials & finished goods are as per prevailing market rate 3. Rate of interest on loan is assumed at 11.50% PA TECHNICAL ASPECTS Production detail & Process of Manufacture: To manufacture Dhoopbatti, eucalyptus leaves, tulsi leaves are cut with the help of leaf cutting machines and left them to drying for 1-2 days. After drying leaves are pulverized and converted in powder form. Guggal, cascalia powder, jigat powder and dried compound are mixed with D. E. P.(Diethyle phthalate oil) in water bath (mixing machine). Now dhoop wood, charcoal powder, groundnut shell powder and powder leaves are mixed uniformly in powder mixing machine. This material alongwith rubber solution (plasticizer), perfumery compound is transferred in edge runner machine. Now material is converted in sticky paste which is transferred in cutting machine to convert it incense sticks. These incense sticks are packed in small boxes and in corrugated boxes for dispatching the material. Quality Control & Specification: As such there are no quality specifications for incense sticks. However, good perfume, burning till last point make incense sticks more popular for sale among people. 3

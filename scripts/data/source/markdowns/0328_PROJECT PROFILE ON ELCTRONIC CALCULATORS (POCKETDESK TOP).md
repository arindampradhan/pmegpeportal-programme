KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON ELCTRONIC CALCULATORS (POCKET/DESK TOP) Introduction : Electronic Calculators are extensively used in offices, banks, shops, departmental sotres & various other establishments. Scientific calculators are sued by students & research workers. These calculators use on integrated circuit. Generally these calculators could be placed in the following categories : 1. Pocket 2. Desk Top 3. Desk top type with printer. These categories could be futher subdivided based on no. digits, type of display i.e.(LCD/Fluorescent etc.) memory function, type of printe i.el. (light/heavy duty), power i.e. (Single/Dual/Triple power operated etc.) As uch a large variety of calculators are availble in market with price running from Rs.70 to Rs.6000 with printer or without printer facility. 1 Name of the Product : ELECTRONIC CALCULATORS (POCKET / DESK TOP) 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work sheds qin.m stqr.sft 0 Rs.

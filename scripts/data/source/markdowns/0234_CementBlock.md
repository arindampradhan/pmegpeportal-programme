CEMENT POLES & WALL COMPOUND ABOUT THE PRODUCT CEMENT POLE One of the most durable and efficient post-and-wire fences is constructed with the help of concrete fence posts. Properly made reinforced or prestressed concrete fence posts have a long life, require very little or no maintenance and give a neat appearance to the fence. Each pole shall be made of concrete proportioned, mixed, placed and compacted to give a dense concrete free from voids. Raw Materials and Manufacturing Process The raw materials mainly are P. C. Wire, cement, G. I. wire, Rodi & Bazari. The concrete prepared by mixing given ratio of cement, Bajari, Rodi & water in a concrete mixture machine, is such that it meets requirement of concrete mix necessary. & no extra water is added in the mix nor the concrete mixture is made in lager quantity, so as to ensure to use the same in given time by filling same in molds having PC tensioned wires. While filling the concrete in molds, they are given sufficient vibrations by shutter vibrators to ensure no gaps/wholes are left in casted poles.

Poles so casted are left in open for natural curing for 42/72 hours depending on day’s temperature. Poles are detensionized after obtaining proper strength & removed from molds, one by one by chain pulley blocks mounted on gentry crane. Poles are stacked with wooden Batta’s placed between each stack, to ensure proper water curing poles are put in water tanks & submerged in it for 10-15 days & thereafter stacked in open. WALL COMPOUND The compound wall is a simple contemporary design, which breaks at two points, on either side of the site, to form horizontal openings that give a glimpse of the serene landscape within. A compound wall serves to demarcate the site, protect one's property, ensure privacy and enhance aesthetic appeal. Brick walls, which have been traditional to India, are time consuming to erect and costly to keep standing. Precast Concrete Boundary Walls overcome these handicaps of traditional brick walls. Precast concrete boundary walls are fast and easy to construct and have a virtually unlimited life. These walls are low maintenance and do not deteriorate with time. Precast Concrete Boundary walls are made from posts erected directly into the ground which have grooves to accommodate textured panels. The commonly manufactured boundary wall systems are of size measuring 6 feet and 8 feet height. Precast Concrete Boundary Wall system is ideal for residential, commercial, and industrial developments.

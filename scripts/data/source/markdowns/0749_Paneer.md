PANEER PRODUCTION Introduction: Paneer is a South Asian variety of soft cheese obtained by acid and heat coagulation of milk. It is a popular indigenous dairy product of India, is similar to an unripened variety of soft cheese which is used in the preparation of a variety of culinary dishes and snacks. It is obtained by heat and acid coagulation of milk, entrapping almost all the fat, casein complexed with denatured whey proteins and a portion of salts and lactose. It is a rich source of high quality animal protein, fat, minerals and vitamins. The production of paneer has been largely confined to the unorganized dairy sector which employs traditional, inefficient methods of manufacture. Uses & Market Potential: Paneer is a staple ingredient in many Indian dishes and can be used fresh or deep fried. Paneer is commonly used in sweets, snacks or with vegetables. Various other uses are follows:  Paneer can be included in curries, particularly with tomatoes, potatoes or peas.

 Cubes of paneer can be added to soup to provide texture.  Fresh paneer can be boiled in sugar syrup and served as a sweet.  Paneer itself has a rather bland flavour but it can act as a flavour carrier. Therefore it is excellent marinated or used in a curry or sauce. The paneer market in India grew at a CAGR of 12.5% during 2014-2019. As a considerable part of population consists of vegetarians, paneer emerges as a viable option. Apart from this, factors such as increasing population, urbanisation rates, improved cold supply chain and growing deep freezer penetration are also influencing the market growth. We can expect the market to exhibit strong growth during 2020-2025. Machinery Requirement: Basic machinery & equipments required are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1.

Manufacturing Process: The milk is procured from vendors and stored in storage tanks prior to primary processing of milk, boiler is utilized to generate steam which is utilized in various process of plant which generally includes heating of milk in this case. This steam is utilized in pasteurizer to heat the milk for pasteurization at temperature ranging from 80 to 90 degree Celsius, after appropriate holding time which is 5 minutes at high temperature steady state, milk is sent to another holding tank which stores the milk so as to cool it to 80 to 75 degree Celsius. As cooling curve for milk is exponential, it does not require any significant cooling time even without any addition cooling arrangement. If a faster cooling is to be achieved ambient water circulation through jackets of holding tank s sufficient. After this temperature is achieved, the milk is pumped into coagulation tank, which has steam jackets to maintain temperature of milk, once steady state temperature is achieved which is 70 degree Celsius for buffalo milk and 80 degree Celsius for cow milk, coagulant is added citric acid, lactic acid etc. The milk is stirred gently and manually till whey separates out. The mixture is allowed to settle and excess whey is drained out, till it reaches close to top surface of coagulated mass. This coagulated mass is fed to paneer press, which essential press the paneer in order to drain out most of water within coagulated mass, in order to obtain a large block of paneer. This paneer block is manually cut in required sizes, checked for required weight, packed and stored in IBT Chilling Machine prior to dispatch, which is essential in order to reduce bacterial growth as well as allows paneer to be stored till dispatch. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities,

documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1400Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp. Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require  FSSAI Registration

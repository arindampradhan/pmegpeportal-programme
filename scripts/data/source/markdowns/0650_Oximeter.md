OXIMETER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A pulse oximeter is a small, lightweight device used to monitor the amount of oxygen carried in the body. It is a non-invasive tool for the measurement of oxygen saturation (Sp O2). This non- invasive tool attaches painlessly to your fingertip, sending two wavelengths of light through the finger to measure your pulse rate and how much oxygen is in your system. Once the oximeter finishes its assessment, its screen will display the percent of oxygen in your blood coming from your heart—as well as your current pulse rate. Oxygen saturation is defined as the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood, based on the detection of Hemoglobin, Hb, and Deoxyhemoglob in, Hb O2. The oximeter contains sensors such as a Sp O2 sensor and pulse rate sensor. Uses & Market Potential: Oximeters are used to monitor oxygen levels in the blood. Those with respiratory and heart conditions benefit most from using these devices, as well as those with COVID- 19. Worldwide pulse oximeters market size to reach USD 2.8 billion by 2025, growing at a CGPR of 9% during the forecast period. The global pulse oximeters industry is

expected to grow at an absolute growth of over 70% during the forecast period. The market is developing because of the increase in the old populace, which is inclined to the danger of respiratory illnesses, hypertension, CVD, diabetes, and different sicknesses that could influence oxygen levels (Sp O2). The expanding accentuation on patient safety during treatment in medical care settings and the demand for consistent vital signs monitoring is expected to drive the pulse oximeters market development. The growing awareness of patient monitoring and an increase in target disease commonness is further liable to support industry development during the forecast period. Strong demand for pulse oximetry and increased end-users spending sentiments on home multiparameter patient monitoring devices overall is adding to market growth. The purchase of at-home pulse oximeters has spiked over 500% since the detection of COVID-19 cases. Several physicians observe pulse oximetry as a significant device to distinguish declining lung function early and address the cause, including COVID-19. Henceforth, the rising adoption of these gadgets has boosted the pulse oximetry demand on the worldwide level, which is further expected to contribute to the market growth in forthcoming years. Product: Oximeter Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Plastic-PP or PVC Granules  Electrical components: Controller IC, Transistors, Sensors, Resistors, Capacitors, LED, etc.  Others: Screws, springs, soldering flux, solder wire, battery, connectors, wires, etc.

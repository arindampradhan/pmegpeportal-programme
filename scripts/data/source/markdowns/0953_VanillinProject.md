PROJECT REPORT ON VANILLIN Introduction: Vanillin, a partially methylated aldehyde of the catechol series, is the fragrant constituent of vanilla bean and occurs also in the sugar beet in balsams and resins. It is an important component of artificial flavour. Vanillin is the main ingredient in artificial vanilla flavours, used most extensively for the flavouring of confectionary, baked goods, candies, chocolates, etc. Vanillin serves widely also in perfumes and cosmetics for imparting sweet and casting notes. It blends well with heliotrope in and coumarone.used in floral and fancy scents alike. Market & Demand Aspect: There is no organised unit in West Bengal for production of vanillin. Most of the vanillin available in the market is a blended product of imported vanillin. There is considerable demand of vanillin in the country for the bakers and confectionery industry, perfumery and cosmetic industry. There is ample scope for its production in the country

Raw materials: The raw materials required for manufacturing of Vanillin are Engenol, Caustic Potash, Acetic Anhydride, Glacial Acetic Acid, Potassium Dichromate. All the above raw materials are available locally from manufacturers or traders. Manufacturing Process & Source of Technology: The synthetic process for manufacture of Vanillin utilizes Eugenol Available from some essential oils. Under the influence of alcoholic KCH at 140°C ofcon C. KCH acqueous at 220°C, Eugenol isomerises to give is eugenol. This is acetylated to protect the phenolic group and Oxidised under mild conditions with potassium dichromate solutions. Isoeugenol is converted to vanillin. Pure Vanillin is obtained by reaction with sodium bisulphate and then distilled to give pure vanillin. The important aromatic aldehydic is widely distributed in nature although it occurs in essential oils, gums, and691 only in small quantities. Most likely plants do not contain vanillin as much but in the form of glycosides which by enzyme action release vanillin. Presumption : a) The working hours : 8 hours per day on single shift basis and 25 working days in a month. b) The cost of machinery and equipment, raw materials etc. are those generally obtaining at the time of the preparation of the project report. c) The rate of interest on Bank loan has been considered as 11.00% p.a. which may vary from time to time. d) The time period for achieving full envisaged capacity utilization is three years. e) The project is based on Single shift working per day and 300 working days per annum f) The rate of interest on Bank loan has been considered as 11.00% p.a. which may vary from time to time.

CHIRONJI PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Buchanania lanzan (chironji) is a commercially important tree species from the Anacardiaceae family. It can be found in India, Myanmar, and Nepal. The plant thrives in dry forests in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Varanasi, and Mirzapur districts of Uttar Pradesh, where it grows on yellow sandy-loam soil. Chironji is a medium-sized, almost evergreen tree with a straight, cylindrical trunk and tormentors branches that grows up to 10-15 m tall. The bark is rough, dark grey or black on the outside and reddish on the inside, fissured into prominent squares and 1.25-1.75 cm thick. The local people have been processing chironji in the traditional way for centuries. Chironji fruits mature in 4 to 5 months and are manually harvested in the months of May and June. During storage, the green-colored skins of harvested chironji fruits turn black and they must be removed before shelling. Fruits are normally soaked overnight in plain water and rubbed between palms or with a jute sack to remove the skin. To obtain cleaned nuts, the water containing fine skin is decanted and washed with fresh water. After cleaning, the nuts are dried in the sun and stored for further processing, such as shelling. The chironji nut is in high demand in international markets and has thus emerged as a significant crop. As a result, the government and private agencies have shown a keen interest in developing this sector, both in terms of output and processing capability, in order to earn foreign exchange. This report explains how to process chironji in a more modern way to enhance the capacity and quality of chironji.

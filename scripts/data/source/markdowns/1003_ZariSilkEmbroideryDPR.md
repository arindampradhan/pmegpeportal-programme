ZARI SILK EMBROIDERY UNIT Introduction: Zari is an even thread traditionally made of fine gold or silver used mostly in traditional garments, especially as brocade in saris etc. It is believed this tradition started during the Mughal era. Today, in most fabrics, Zari has cotton or polyester yarn at its core, wrapped by golden/silver metallic yarn. These elegant Sarees are known all over the world for their transparency, exquisite designs and engraved buti work. These are supplied to be sold in all major cities of the country. Uses & Market Potential: The zari saree tracks or is encouraged by the Mughal designs. The Banarasi sarees came into existence in the course of the Mughal times when Muslim artisans and craftsmen chose Banaras as the dwelling that unified well with their culture and started weaving silk Banarasi sarees. Textile is the fastest-growing application of silk. Silk is an important contributor to the textile industry which is continuously growing and evolving in terms of demand and supply. Silk is used in textiles for its lustrous appearance, luxurious feel, lightweight, resilient, and strength. It is used in many types of apparel such as wedding dresses, gowns, blouses, scarves, neckties as well as in many household products such as pillows, wall hangings, draperies, upholstery. Further, Silk's absorbency makes it quite comfortable to wear, especially, in warm weather. Its low conductivity keeps warm air

1. INTRODUCTION Mops are divided into two categories: wet mops and dry mops. Kitchen and bathroom floors are frequently cleaned using wet mops. They generally feature sponge or cloth heads that may be soaked in water with a detergent or other cleaner (known as a surfactant) and then rinsed when done. Wet mop heads are simple to clean and should be done on a frequent basis to keep them effective in cleaning and absorbing dust. Wet mops should be fully dried before being kept, and cotton threads that fray at the ends should be cut on a regular basis. When mop heads get worn, they may be replaced. The dry mop, also known as the dust mop, has a wide, flat head that can easily be moved across a floor surface. As the mop glides across the floor, the strings in the head take up dust, lint, and hair. The mop can be manoeuvred under beds and into other locations with restricted access thanks to a swivel at the point where the mop head joins the handle. To eliminate dust, shake a dry mop outside; however, if the dust clogs the mop, immerse it in soapy water overnight. A machine-washable mop head is included. After cleaning, treat the dry mop with dust mop oil to protect it and assist the dust adhere to the mop head. In 2018, the floor scrubber sector has a market share of over 46%. Scrubbers are a common cleaning product in both the home and commercial sectors. The addition of ride-on features, which minimise the amount of time necessary for cleaning, will increase demand for the product. In 2018, commercial applications

accounted for more than 77 percent of all applications. Increased need for effective cleaning products, such as floor, surface, furniture, and carpet cleaners, has resulted from rapid expansion in the infrastructure industry. The rapidly growing hotel sector throughout the world is also a major driver of business expansion. Increasing number of hospitals and hotels, particularly in developing countries like India, China, and Vietnam, is also likely to contribute to the market growth. Moreover, constant product innovation will drive the segment further. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES A floor wiper is a tool having a flat, smooth rubber blade that is used to remove liquid from a flat surface or to regulate the flow of liquid. Cleaning and printing are two uses for it. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS  Floor wiper manufacturing begins with the making of outer plastic body. For this plastic injection molding machine is used.  In the machine desired profile is mounted in the precise location. Now PP granules are fed into the injection molding machine hopper.  Granules are then melted in the machine and injected in the mold. After the process the molded material is fetched out of the machine after it cools.  In the next step EVA sheets are cut based on the plastic body dimension in the desired length and width. Now they are manually fitted by plastic base with the help of rivets.  After this iron pipes are press fitted to the molded material with the help of screw press machine. Now these iron pipes are covered with the PVC sleeves and fed into the heat shrink packaging machine. In this process the iron pipe gets wrapped with PVC sleeves.  Now the wrapped iron pipes and wiper bases are packed and send for sale in the market. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1800 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project.

It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1000 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 500 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 200 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Injection Molding Machine- An injection moulding machine also known as an injection press, is a machine for manufacturing plastic products by the injection moulding process.  Vertical Foam Cutting: Vertical Foam Cutting Machine is a practical table model for the vertical cutting of foam blocks. The table running on ball bearings.

 Heat Shrink Packaging Machine: The technique of shrink wrapping, also known as bundle wrapping, involves wrapping a group of products or a single product. For this, a Shrink Wrap Machine, either automated or semi-automatic, is utilized. Heat causes the material to shrink and securely adhere to the shape of the contained substance.  Pouch Sealing Machine: The machine creates plastic bags and stand-up pouches from a flat roll of film while simultaneously filling and sealing the bags with goods. This packaging technique may be used to package both solids and liquids.

 Screw Press Machine: A screw press is a type of machine press in which a screw drives the ram up and down. A metalworking press is a machine tool that deforms metal with a die to shape or cut it. Rather of cutting or drilling a hole in sheet metal, it is typically utilized to punch the hole in one operation. Equipment Hammer Material handling equipment

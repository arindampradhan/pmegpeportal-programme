TOWEL MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The towels that are essential for our bathrooms are used dozens of times every day, but few of us know how they are made. A towel is a piece of absorbent fabric or paper used for drying or wiping. It draws moisture through direct contact, often using a blotting or a rubbing motion. Common household textile towels are made from cotton, rayon, bamboo, nonwoven fibers, or a few other materials. Terry Towel, a pile fabric is known as a towel worldwide. In terry towel loop piles are present on one or both sides of the fabric. The research indicates that the terry towel was first developed in Turkey first and later towel manufacturing concept spreads across the world. Uses & Market Potential: A towel is an absorbent piece of cloth or paper that is used to dry or wipe a body or a surface. It absorbs moisture from the air by making direct contact. Fabric towels are used in homes in a variety of ways, including paper towels, bath towels, bathrobes, and kitchen towels. Beach towels are used at the beach. A bath towel is used in the bathroom to dry the body. Europe is the world's most populous consumption area, and consumption has a strong link to local economic growth.

MUSTARD OIL MILL Introduction Mustard oil is made from pressing the seeds of a mustard plant to produce spicy oil. Mustard oil is popular in Eastern cooking, although some American chefs have begun experimenting with the oil, which has a heat and distinctive flavour to it. Ingredients Mustard oil is made from Mustard seeds. Different types of Mustard seeds are available in the market & it contains natural flavour. Product types/Verities of Mustard Oil There are three varieties of mustard oil available in market includes B. nigra (black mustard), B. juncea (brown mustard), and B. hirta (white mustard). Mustard oil market is segmented on the basis of product type, production process, application, distribution channels and region. On the basis of product type includes B. nigra (black mustard), B. juncea (brown mustard), and B. hirta (white mustard). Among all of these, black mustard is majorly used in terms of volume and is expected to grow due to its various applications in market.

Benefits of Mustard Oil 1. Mustard essential oil has been found to be a powerful antibacterial agent. Source found that mustard essential oil effectively killed off common and harmful bacteria such as salmonella, staph, listeria, and even a certain type of yeast. It can also be used as an antifungal. 2. Mustard oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. Researchers have consistently found that including monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. 3. Mustard oil contains a compound that could be useful for reducing inflammation: allyl isothiocyanate. Uses of Mustard Oil Mustard essential oil has great anti-inflammatory properties. Historically, mustard oil has been used to: As cooking oil • Treat arthritis • Soothe aches and pains • Decrease inflammation from chest conditions such as bronchitis • and pneumonia Relieves Body pain • Description of Mustard Oil Machine Mustard Oil Machine (known as Ghani) is used to produce mustard oil from the Mustard seeds. With the help of this machine the work of Mixing, Grinding completes with the help of manual support. An extra button for handling the device is attached in the machine, so that one can control its speed while operating the machine. Mustard Oil Current Market Analysis On the record, production of mustard seeds, a winter crop cultivated in the northern States was very high as compared to last year. Rajasthan is the major producer contributing up to 47 per cent of the domestic production, followed by Madhya Pradesh (11.44 per cent), Haryana (12 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (10.41 per cent).

Consumption of mustard oil has grown about 5 percent per year for the past 40 years and currently stands at approximately 2.3 million metric tons annually. Although consumption of mustard oil is typically more prevalent in rural areas, total consumption is usually higher in urban areas. Most mustard oil (around 90 percent) is used for cooking, and the rest is used for pickling and consumption as raw oil (sareson-ka-thal, “oil of mustard”) directly on foods. Mustard oil Manufacturing Process • Take the raw material (Mustard Seeds) & put it into the Ghani machine hopper. • After that start the machine & process of crushing the mustard seeds will start. It requires manual manpower to operate the machine as well as for the crushing process. • It takes time to manually crush the material and the generation of oil from it. • After that put the Mustard oil cake into the expeller for generating the more oil from the machine. • Next step is to collect the Mustard oil from the expeller and put it into the filter machine for the filtering process. • After filtering of oil, product is ready for packaging. Ghani Machine process is the base for Mustard oil production process. The production process begins with the procurement of raw material i.e. Mustard seeds. The procurement of raw material depends upon the quality parameters set by the producer. One round of mustard oil production takes 90-100 minutes for completion of production process. Maximum 5 completed Rounds of Mustard oil production can be done in a shift of 8 hours a day. Normally Mustard oil is generated at 28-30% of raw material but we can increase its production by 5% using the expeller machine for more production of mustard oil by reprocessing left mustard cake. Maximum oil produced through one round of 12 kg of raw material is 3.96 KG. Density of 1 litre oil = .90 KG So, production per round = 3.96/.90 = 4.4 litre oil. The Oil Produced from this process is 100% pure.

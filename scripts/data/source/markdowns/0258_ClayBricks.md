1. INTRODUCTION Bricks are used extensively in construction, ranging from thatched roofs to multi-story structures. Only modest modifications have been made to the brick-making process throughout the years. Bricks are the oldest building material, and they are still widely used today owing to their durability, availability, and inexpensive cost. The quality of structures has greatly increased as a result of improved brick manufacturing and burning processes. Clay bricks have been used as a construction material for thousands of years, with evidence reaching all the way back to the Roman Empire. Small units of construction material, commonly constructed from baked clay and secured with mortar, a bonding agent made up of cement, sand, and water, are referred to as bricks. Brick has long been a popular building material because it retains heat, resists corrosion, and is fire resistant. Brick is a suitable material for buildings in limited areas and curving designs since each unit is small—typically four inches broad and twice as long. Furthermore, brick structures often survive a long period with little maintenance. Improvements in brick making have persisted throughout the twentieth century. The brick shape has been made completely consistent, the weight has been reduced, and the fire process has been sped up. Modern bricks, for example, are rarely solid. Some of them are pressed into form, leaving a frog, or depression, on the upper surface. Others are extruded with holes, which will speed up the firing process by exposing more surface area to heat. Both methods help you lose weight without reducing power. Brick is a durable ceramic product consisting of clay or shale that is moulded, dried, and fired. Clay is a naturally occurring mineral that is found in abundance throughout the planet. Clay must have certain qualities and features in order to be used in brick making. Plasticity, which allows them to be moulded or moulded when combined with water, is required, as well as adequate wet and air- dry strength to preserve their shape after forming. In addition, the clay particles must fuse together when heated to the proper temperature. The term brick originally referred to a tiny

unit of construction material made largely of clay. The colour of the brick is determined by the mineral composition of the clay: reddish clays carry a lot of iron oxide, whereas white or yellow clays include a lot of lime. In modern times, the term "brick" has come to mean any tiny rectangular building unit connected to other units by cementitious mortar (larger building units are called blocks). Clay is still one of the most popular brick ingredients, but sand and lime, concrete, and fly ash are also prevalent. 2. PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 3.1 PRODUCT USES It's probably true to state that around 65 percent of all brick is used in residential construction, while 35 percent is used in commercial, industrial, and institutional structures. Construction techniques vary from year to year and from nation to country, but the majority of brick and tile is utilised in walls, with roofs and floors receiving less attention. 3.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The basic raw material used in the product is Clay & Coal. 3.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process has six general phases: 1) mining and storage of raw materials, 2) preparing raw materials, 3) forming the brick, 4) drying, 5) firing and cooling and 6) de-hacking and storing finished product:  Mining & Storage: In the first step raw material is procured from the vendor and brought to the making area. Surface clays, shales and some fire clays are mined in open pits with power equipment. Then the clay or shale mixtures are transported to plant storage areas. The storage of adequate quantities of raw materials necessary for several days of plant operation ensures continuous brick manufacturing regardless of weather conditions. To make mixing the clays easier, numerous storage rooms (one for each source) are usually employed. Blending creates more consistent raw materials, aids color management, and permits raw material control for a certain brick body to be manufactured.

 Preparation: Before mixing the raw material, clay is processed through size-reduction machines to break up large clay lumps and stones. To control particle size, the material is usually processed through inclined vibrating screens.  Forming: The initial phase in the shaping process is tempering, which results in a homogenous, flexible clay material. Adding water to the clay in a pug mill, a mixing chamber with one or more spinning shafts with blade extensions, is usually how this is accomplished. The plastic clay mass is ready to form after pugging. The three main methods for making brick are stiff-mud, soft-mud, and dry-press.  Drying: Depending on the forming process, wet brick produced by molding or cutting machines contains 7 to 30% moisture. Most of this water is evaporated in drier chambers at temperatures ranging from around 100 degrees Fahrenheit to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius to 204 degrees Celsius) before the firing process begins. Drying time varies depending on the clay, however it generally ranges from 24 to 48 hours. Although heat may be created particularly for drier chambers, it is most often provided by kiln exhaust heat to improve thermal efficiency. To prevent cracking in the brick, heat and humidity must be properly controlled in all circumstances.  Hacking: The procedure of putting brick into a kiln vehicle or kiln is known as hacking. The size of the kiln determines the quantity of bricks on the kiln vehicle. Robots or automated techniques are usually used to install the bricks. The look is influenced by the setting pattern. Bricks laid face-to-face will have a more consistent hue than bricks laid crosswise or back-to-back.  Firing: Depending on the kiln type and other conditions, bricks are burned between 10 to 40 hours. Kilns are utilized by manufacturers in a variety of ways. Tunnel kilns are the most frequent, followed by periodic kilns. Natural gas, coal, sawdust, landfill methane gas, or a mix of these fuels may be used. Although the actual temperatures will differ with clay or shale, final drying takes place at temperatures up to about 400 ºF (204 ºC), dehydration from about 300 ºF to 1800 ºF (149 ºC to 982 ºC), oxidation from 1000 ºF to 1800 ºF (538 ºC to 982 ºC) and vitrification from 1600 ºF to 2400 ºF (871 ºC to 1316 ºC).  Cooling: The cooling process begins once the temperature has reached its maximum and has been sustained for a certain period of time. In tunnel kilns, cooling time seldom exceeds 10 hours, while in periodic kilns, cooling time ranges from 5 to 24 hours.

Because the pace of cooling has a direct influence on color, cooling is an essential stage in brick manufacture.  De-hacking: After the bricks have cooled, de-hacking is the process of emptying a kiln or kiln vehicle, which is frequently done by robots. Sorted, graded, and packed bricks After that, they're either stored in a yard or put onto rail cars or vehicles for distribution.  Storing: The brick is removed from the kiln vehicle after it has been fired and cooled using the de-hacking process, which has been automated to the point that nearly all manual brick handling has been eliminated. The bricks are subsequently delivered to the project site, where they are usually unloaded by boom trucks.

 JCB Machine for Mud Falling-Plantation, rural road construction, fiber optics laying, truck unloading, and tractor trolley loading are all common uses for the JCB Loader.  Brick Kiln - Kiln is a term used to describe an oven used for firing, drying, baking, hardening, or burning a substance, usually clay, but also grain and meal in the past. Because it produced a stronger brick than the original sun-dried product, the brick kiln was a great advancement in ancient technology.

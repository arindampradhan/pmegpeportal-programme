"KVIC- PMEGP" PROJECT PROFILE ON REGULATED D. C. POWER SUPPLIES Introduction : Regulated DC power supplies provide accurate DC Voltage which are derived from AC mains. These suppliers are cheaper in nature than the DC sources like dry cells, rechargable cells etc. Such supplies provide costant voltage irrespective of load variations for which they are designed. DC power supplies are used extensively in various electronics laboratories, industries and communiation departments to feed DC Voltages to the modules, to check their parameters, in R & D sections, institutions and colleges to impart practical training etc. Present range of electronic equipment produced in the country makes use of transistors and integrated circuits. These IC's are designed to work on fixed regulated DC voltages. Therefore such supplies have become the part and parcel of such equipment. 1 Name of the Product : REGULATED D. C.

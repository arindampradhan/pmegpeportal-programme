CHARCOAL FACEWASH MAKING UNIT Introduction: Soaps or Face washes are salts of fatty acids that are used for the purpose of cleaning the body. The soap present in the face wash solubilizes particles and grime which are then separated from the surface by washing it. They also kill the micro-organisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils by enabling them to be carried away by running water. They are created by treating fats or oils with a base. A face wash is milder than soap as it is specially created for the face as the skin on the face is more sensitive compared to the rest of the body. A soap is alkaline in nature while our skin has acidic p H and this may strip away the moisture from our skin making it dry. The face wash on the other hand has milder surfactants instead of strong bases that does not change the p H of the skin much hence keeping its softness intact. Additionally, the presence of humectants in the face wash helps to retain moisture. While the main ingredients of a face wash are Surfactants, foam boosters, thickeners, etc. some ingredients are added to enhance their properties further and are called “special ingredients”. Activated charcoal is one such ingredient that enhances the cleansing properties of the face wash. Activated charcoal is a fine, black, odorless powder that is made by superheating sources of carbon in absence of air.

Uses & Market Potential: The use of the Activated charcoal face wash is use absorb the toxins, dirt, grime, oil from the face and kills the micro-organisms due to the presence of the Activated charcoal in it. The global activated charcoal market size was valued at USD 4.2 Billion in 2018 and was anticipated to grow at an expanding CAGR while that of liquid soaps at expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% in the forecast period of 2020-2025. The market is driven by increasing concerns over health and hygiene by the people across the world. Moreover, the increasing living standards and rising disposable income are also leading the buyers to opt more aesthetically appealing and promising products that have effective ingredients like Activated Charcoal. The advertisement of the enhanced products have also contributed to the growth of the products. However, the rising concerns for the use of chemical substances such as Parabens, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Dioxane, etc. have somehow hindered the market to some extent ads these products considered to be harmful for the skin. This has encouraged the use of natural products to be incorporated in the manufacturing of the Face Wash and Shower Gels. Product: Charcoal Facewash Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Surfactants  Nitrosol  Citric or Ascorbic Acid  Activated charcoal powder

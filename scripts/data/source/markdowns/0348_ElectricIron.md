ELECTRIC IRON Introduction:A clothes iron (also flatiron or smoothing iron) has a handle and a flat triangle shaped surface. Electricity makes the flat surface hot. A hot iron is rubbed on clothes to make them flat and smooth. This is called ironing. The handle does not get hot because that is where it is held. They are named clothes irons because they used to be made out of the metal iron. It is an electrical device that heats up to take wrinkles out of clothing. It is somewhat triangle shaped with a smooth flat bottom. The pointed end is for pressing corners and tight areas. It holds water to produce steam, which helps to remove wrinkles. Before electric irons there were heavy cast iron irons that were heated up by fire before use. Electric coil of Iron is most resistance wire heating elements use nichrome 80/20 (80% nickel, 20% chromium) wire, ribbon, or strip. Nichrome 80/20 is an ideal material, because it has relatively high resistance and forms an adherent layer of chromium oxide when it is heated for the first time. Uses & Market Potential: Ironed clothes make one look smarter and leave a better impression. The use of ironing extends the life of the fabric over time as it prevents the clothes from fraying. Furthermore, it is much better than the alternative to dry cleaning, which uses harmful chemical perchloroethylene. Ironing helps in removing the smell of bleach from the clothes. Student fraternity has emerged as one of the key buyers of the product. Most schools and educational institutions based in Asian countries

including India, China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan have a strict uniform. It is made mandatory among students to wear clean and well-ironed clothes to invoke a habit of disciplined, hygienic, and smart lifestyle. People working in corporate have also included ironed clothes as a part of office wear. The global electric iron market size was valued at USD 1.0 billion in 2018 and anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 8.3% over the forecast period. Increasing demand among the millennial to look well-dressed is expected to promote the utility of these products. Furthermore, a well-ironed set of clothes has become the symbol of an elite society member. Product: Electric Iron Raw Material: 1. Aluminium Billets 2. Heating Element 3. Plastic Resins Bakelite 4. PFTE Powder 5. Thermostat 6. Electric Cord 7. Packing Material

Manufacturing Process: Fig.1 – Flow Chart At first, the raw material is procured from the authorized local vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the electric iron sole plate is manufactured by pouring the molten aluminium in the mould. The mould has the desired shape as required for the sole plate. The furnace is kept on and brought up to desired temperature of melting point aluminium. Aluminium billets are brought from the inventory and fed into the furnace through feeder. After this, the molten aluminum is poured into moulds having the desired shape of sole plate of electric iron. The molten aluminium solidifies which is separated from the mould. In the next step, the sole plate coated with non-stick material to improve the base efficiency. The base plate is first dipped in the acidic solution of sulphuric acid for pickling process. The base plate is kept inside the acid for 15-20 minutes.

In the next step, they are pre heated to a temperature of 350 to 400 . After this, PFTE is coated over the base plate in PFTE coating plant. The PTFE ℃ powder is sprayed over the surface of base plate at desired pressure using electrostatic powder spray guns. A process called electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) is typically used to achieve the application of the powder coating to a metal substrate. This application method uses a spray gun, which applies an electrostatic charge to the powder particles, which are then attracted to the grounded part. The waste powder is separated through cyclone arrangement could be reuse. In the next step, the plastic casing for cover body and handle of the electric iron is injection moulded using plastic injection moulding machine. The die of desired shape is precisely assembled in the clamping unit of the machine as per production requirement. The barrel heaters are started and brought to the desired temperature to melt down the thermoplastic pellets. Plastic pellets are then brought from the warehouse and fed into the hopper of the machine. From the hopper, these plastic pellets come into the feed section of the barrel. There is a screw inside the barrel which rotates about the vertical axis and moves the pellets into heating section of barrel where these plastic pellets melt to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the mold of the machine. When resin melts the barrel compress the molten plastic into the profile dies to form the desired contours. After this, it solidifies to form the desired molded part. These plastic covers are collected and send to the assembly shop. The heating element, thermostat are electrically connected using electric cables over the base plate. The electric cord is connected for power supply to the heating element. Plastic covers and handles are assembled at precise locations. In the next step, quality testing of the assembly unit is performed for satisfactory performance. After this, the Electric irons are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity.

Area: The inddustrial seetup requirres space for Inventtory, workkshop or mmanufactuuring area, sppace for power supply utilitiees and auxxiliary likee Generator setup. AAlso some of the aarea of building is requiired for office sttaff faciliities, documeentation, ooffice furnniture, etc. Thus, thee approximmate total area requuired for commplete inddustrial settup is 15000 - 2000SSqft. Civil work costt will be RRs. 9 Lac (Appprox.) Machiines: 1. Furnnace –Thhe furnace uses eelectrical inductionn heating to melt the alumminium ussing princciple of induction melting is that a high voltage electtrical sourrce from aa primary coil inducces a low vvoltage, high currennt in the metal, orr secondaary coil. Innduction heating iis simply a methodd of trannsferring hheat energgy. 2. PFTTE Coatingg Plant – TThe plant consist of heating furnace, sspray gunss for adheerence of Teflon ovver the heaating surfface. The pplant is seemi-autommatic designed as peer the prooduction caapacity for the plant.

i) Coating Booth –The coating booth represents the area for powder coating with cyclone arrangement and pressure valves to collect the waste powder for reuse. ii) Spray Gun –It is used to spray the PFTE powder over the surface of aluminium with the help of compressor pressure. iii) Heating Oven – The purpose of heating oven to pretreat the components for heating purpose. 3. Plastic Injection Moulding Machine – The main working principle of plastic molding machine is to use the plastic thermal physical properties. First, we auto loader the plastic material into the barrel, which is surround by heating elements melting the plastic. In the barrel which is assembled with servo motor screw. The plastic melt will flow up the screw and under the heating condition get tight and move forward to the screw head. At the same time, due to the plastic reacting force, the screw will step back. So at the screw head, it formed a plastic melt saving space to finish its plasticizing process.

Equipments: Profile Dies– A die is a specialized tool used in manufacturing industries to cut or shape material mostly using a press. Conveyor – The rolling conveyors are used to carry the material in coating plant during powder coating process. Studs, Fasteners, screws –These are used to assemble the laminations core and other auxiliaries to the transformer tank.

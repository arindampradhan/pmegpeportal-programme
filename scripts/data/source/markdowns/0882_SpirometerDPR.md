SPIROMETER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The Incentive Spirometer (Lung Exerciser) is an innovative system that allows you to exercise respiration through stimulation/ inspiration. This is a handheld device that is helpful to improve and maintain the respiratory fitness. It is useful in maintaining and restoring lungs capacity of post-operative ambulatory and COPD patients. It has an attractive design with color-coded balls for easy identification of 1200cc, 900cc & 600cc breathing capacity to provide more efficient exercise to patient at a step up basis. Innovative design, can be dismantled into parts for cleaning & disinfection. Uses & Market Potential: The Spirometer market was projected at USD 799.5 Million in 2019 and it is expected to expand at a CAGR of 9.7 % from 2020 to 2027. An increase in the prevalence of the Chronic Respiratory Diseases, growing preference for home healthcare, and different technological advancements are expected to drive the market. Around 2.0 billion people, worldwide, are exposed to Air pollution regularly, both indoor and outdoor, and the pollutants and irritants have severe adverse effects on the lungs. To simplify the complex procedures of the lungs testing for patients as well as medical professionals, companies are developing spirometers with improved designs and features. The main objective here being to develop spirometers with higher yield and improved patient comfort without complications.

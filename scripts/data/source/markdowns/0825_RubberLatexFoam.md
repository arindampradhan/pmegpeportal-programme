Raw material: 60 NR Latex is the principal raw - material of the unit which is locally available from Rubber Board. It constitutes about 75 percent of all raw materials required by the unit. Chemicals like potassium Oleate soap solution, Sulphur, Vulcafor ZDC/ MBT, nonox B/SP, China Clay. Zinc oxide, etc. are also used. Average raw material cost will be Rs. 100-120 per Kg. Machine requirement: Major machineries & equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Deamoniation tank of 400 Ltr 2 70000 140000 Planetary Mixer 2 420000 840000 12 Jar Pot Mill with 3 HP Motor 1 250000 250000 High speed Mixer with 1 HP 1 100000 100000 Motor Boiler with 3 HP Motor 1 550000 550000 Steam vulcanizer,Foam squeezing 1 420000 420000 machine, Trays Moulds and Testing equipments Total Amount 2300000 Manufacturing Process: Latex is demonized and mixed with stabilizer foaming agent and sensitizer. The mix is foamed by boating air into it in a planetary mixer. Formation of foam is also assisted by blowing air below the surface of latex. After 4 to 6 times the original liquid volume is attained a dispersion of remaining ingredients are added so that more uniform structure is obtained by eliminating larger bubbles. The foam is poured/ injected into moulds and vulcanized by steam at 100 degree C for 35 to 45 minutes. The vulcanizing time depends on thickness of foam. After vulcanization mould is cooled and the foam, released from mould, is squeezed between rollers and thoroughly washed. These are then tested and packed for sales.

PERFUME MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction Perfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent. It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body. Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarone, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone. The word perfume derives from the Latin perfumer, meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization and maybe Ancient China. It was further refined by the Romans and the Arabs. In India, perfume and perfumery existed in the Indus civilization. Fragrance Notes Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, making the harmonious scent accord. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume. Top notes: Also called the head notes. The scents that are  perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander. Middle notes: Also referred to as heart notes. The scent of a  perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note. The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a

perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine. Base notes: The scent of a perfume that appears close to the  departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk. The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a fragrance pyramid, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed. Ingredients some of the important ingredients of perfume include – rose flower extraction, carrier oil & DM water. Description of Perfume Machine Machinery for perfume includes the following:  Blending Machine  Packaging machine (Automatic/ Normal)  Chemical testing equipment  Flavour extraction unit These Machines are used to produce perfume from different types of raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span. Perfume Market Analysis According to industry estimates, the overall size of the Indian perfume industry is currently estimated at Rs. 2000 crores,

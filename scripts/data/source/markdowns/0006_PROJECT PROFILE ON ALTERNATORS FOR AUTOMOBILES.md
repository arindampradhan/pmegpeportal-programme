KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON ALTERNATORS FOR AUTOMOBILES Introduction : Alternator is a special dc device, which converts machanical power into direct current (dc) electric power by means of rotation. It gives dc supply to various electrical parts while automobile is working such as headlights, wiper motor, different indicator lights, fan etc. It also charges the battery of the automobile , which gives dc supply to all electrical components when automobiles is not working and primarily to starter motor for cranking the engine of automobile.

PROJECT PROFILE FOR COIR PITH BLOCK MAKING UNIT INTRODUCTION Coir pith or dust is a biomass residue generated during the extraction of coir fibre from coconut husk and is a byproduct of the coir industry. The coir pith is a very light and compressible material. It is highly hygroscopic and holds water of 7 to 8 fold by weight. Coir pith has an ability to be compressed into a wide range of added value products such as seed cells, propagation modules all the way. The major properties of coir pith are: • High water holding capacity, i.e., 6-8 times than its weight. • Excellent moisture retention even after drying. • Slow degradation due to high lignocellulose bonding. • High porosity, stores and releases nutrients over extended periods of time. • Greater physical resiliency that with stands compression better. • Excellent aeration / oxygenation providing enhanced root penetration. • Acceptable Electrical Conductivity (EC), p H and Cation Exchange Capacity CEC). • 100% degradable, organic and a renewable resource.

It is more suitable for growing media (in agriculture). Most of the Green houses are using this media for various cultivation like flowers, fruits, vegetables, ornamental plants & medicinal plants etc. throughout the world. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE Coir pith block is specially designed for commercial nurseries and greenhouses. This soil conditioner is suitable for all types of garden plants, lawns, flowers, orchids and vegetables in pots or on the ground. The coir pith is compressed into very small packs of 650 gm, shrink wrapped which is most suitable to the hobby market and home garden owners. Coir pith Block Specifications Available Sizes- 5 kg and 650 gm Parameters 5 Kg Block 650 gm Block Weight 5 Kg +/- 0.3 Kg 650gm +/- 30gm Size 30 x 30 x 13 cm 20 x 10 x 5 cm Compression ratio 5:1 8:1 Moisture content < 20% < 20% Electrical Conductivity < 0.5 milliohms/cm < 0.5 milliohms/cm Expanded Volume 13 to 14 L/Kg 8 to 9 L/Kg BASIS AND PRESUMTIONS • The Project Profile is based on 8 working hours in a day and 175 days in a year and the Break Even efficiency has been calculated at 70%, 75%, 80%, 90% and 100% capacity utilization. • The rate of interest both for fixed asset and working capital have been taken as 11.5% p.a.

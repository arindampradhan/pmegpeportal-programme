ANIMATION PRODUCTION UNIT INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Animation studio business falls under the Video Postproduction Services industry and the industry includes companies that prepare motion pictures for public distribution by performing editing, subtitling, closed captioning, animation and other special effects services. It is important to state that companies that are involved in movie or television production and perform post – production activities in-house are not part of this industry. In recent time, following consumer disinterest in 3D film and shifting interest from TV to online content, many animation studios have re – strategized and repositioned their client base towards the increasing number of online streaming services and advertisers that require editing services for their productions, boosting revenue for the Video Postproduction Services industry.

The truth is that when it comes to productions from animation studios, there is indeed a wide range of available customers. In essence, your target market can’t be restricted to just a group of people or media houses, but all those that have access to both terrestrial TV stations and satellite/cable TV stations and even the online community. So, if you are thinking of opening your own animation studio, then you should make target demographics all encompassing; it should include everyone. List of Niche ideas Within the Animation Studio Business That You Can Specialize in It is the norm for animation studios to be creative and come up with productions that will catch the fancy of their target audience; it could be cartoons for children or animation advertisement for adults. That is why it seems that there are no niche areas in the industry. But on the other hand, some animation studio may decide to major in some key areas such as; Post processing animation video content  Audio editing (adding looping and sound effects)  Adding closed captioning, subtitles or dubbing  Creating and inserting graphics, animation or special effects  Creating credits  Formatting animation content for various media  Receiving and incorporating feedback from test audiences  Promotional activities  Operating animation film libraries (preserving and storing finished  videos and stock footage).

The Level of Competition in the Animation Studio Line of Business The bottom line is that no matter the level of competition in an industry, if you have done your due diligence and you brand and promote your services or business properly, you will always make headway in the industry. Just ensure you are good and creative at producing animation contents or films, you can deliver excellent customer care services and you know how to attract and reach out to your target market. But over and above, there are several animation studios, complimentary businesses such as graphics studios, video production studios and any other businesses that also produce animation content for media scattered all around the United States and in the cyberspace. Starting Your Animation Studio Business from Scratch vs Buying a Franchise When it comes to starting a business of this nature, it will pay you to buy the franchise of a successful and well – established animation studio brand if you have the funds as against starting from the scratch. Even though it is relatively expensive buying the franchise of an established animation studio brand, but it will definitely pay you in the long run. Besides starting an animation studio business from the scratch is less stressful when compared to other small-scale businesses. With an animation studio business, you should just try as much as possible to get the right employees, animation and graphic skills, tools and equipment, build business relationship and network with key stakeholders and then leverage on every marketing tool within your disposal especially the internet to market your services. Please note that most of the big and successful animation studios around started from the scratch and they were able to build a solid business brand.

PROJECT PROFILE ON MILLET FOOD PRODUCTS INTRODUCTION Traditionally fermented foods and beverages obtained from millet or millet mixed with other cereals (corn and sorghum) include koko (millet porridge), fura, mangishi, jandh, uji, burukutu, kunu- zaki, ogi, and bushera. Unfermented millet-based products include dambu, masvusvu, and roti Millet is a cereal grain that belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family (1). It's widely consumed in developing countries throughout Africa and Asia. While it may look like a seed, millet's nutritional profile is similar to that of sorghum and other cereals. It is rich in minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and selenium as well as essential vitamins like folate, pantothenic acid, niacin, riboflavin, and Vitamins B6, C, E, and K. Many of the most powerful health benefits millet has to offer are related to its fiber content. Millet Based Cookie Cookie is a small flat, baked product, commonly called biscuit. Cookie usually prepared from wheat flour, eggs, sugar and fat, sometimes toppings with raisins, oats or chocolate chips. Generally, wheat is one of the cereals used extensively throughout the world for the preparation of cookie. But cookie from non-wheat cereals like rice, jowar, maize or millet is uncommon. Recently, millets are gaining importance because they can offer several nutraceuticals, and also being rich in protein, minerals and vitamins. Its protein has a beneficial influence on the metabolism of cholesterol. Cereal or millet cookie is made from a fine flour of millet with leavening and shortenings. There exists, however considerable potential for large scale manufacture and marketing of shelf-stable product utilizing underutilized grains like proso or foxtail millet as Demand for ready-to- eatconvenience food products has been steadily increasing, consequent to industrialization. 2

MARKET DEMAND The global millet consumption has declined at a rate of 0.9% and expected to witness positive movement during the forecast period. India, Niger, and China are the largest producers of millet in the world, accounting for more than 55% of global production. For many years, India was the world’s major producer of millet. However, in recent years, millet production has increased dramatically in Africa. The global millet production was estimated at 27.8 million tons. India is the largest global producer with a 41.0% global market share. In the last two decades, the importance of millet as food staples, particularly in India, has been declining due to various factors, including rising incomes, growing urbanization, and government policies. More than 50% of the millet production is currently finding its way into alternative uses as opposed to its consumption only as a staple. Due to COVID-19 issues in across the world the demand of nutrition based foods are having good demand, thus the millet based food industry will shine significantly. Energy Conservation: General precautions for saving electricity are followed by the unit by providing energy meter. These products are low energy consumption. Thus considerable energy could be saved during manufacturing activities. BASIS AND PRESUMPTION OF THE PROJECT: • The process of manufacture is on the basis of single shift eight hours per shift with three hundred working days in a year. • To achieve full plant capacity it requires three month trial production • Labor and wages mentioned in profile are as per prevailing local rates. • Interest rate at 11% considered in the project • However the rate of interest may be varying while implement • The Promoter contribution will be 10% of the total project cost 3

IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE The major activities and their implementation schedule are furnished below. The assessment of the items required for implementation of the project has been considered and accounted from the date of sanction of the loan: Sno Activities Period in No. months 1 Application to financial institutions, 1 submission of documents, certificates for loan and other formalities 1 Placement of orders for machinery and 2 equipments and application for power connection 3 Procurement of raw materials 1 1 Clearing machinery, installation, electrification 4 etc. 5 Trial and commercial production 1 Total 5 QUALITY CONTROL:- The quality of finished product and raw material will adhere to FSSAI standard and Consumer requirement. PRODUCTION CAPACITY The production capacity per annum by this process of manufacture is about 62 M. Tons. POLLUTION CONTROL Since no pollutants are generated during and after manufacture, no pollution control methods are required. ENERGY CONSERVATION Energy requirement for this method of manufacture is about 15% more than the other processes, the production capacity is higher leading to better profitability. MANPOWER Following Manpower is required for starting Manufacturing unit : - Food Technologist 1 4

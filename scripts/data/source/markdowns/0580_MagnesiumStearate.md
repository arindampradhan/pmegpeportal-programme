PROJECT REPORT On MAGNESIUM STEARATE INTRODUCTION: Magnesium Stearate is a white soapy powder. It is solid at room temperature. It is combination of Stearic Acid and the essential mineral Magnesium. It is a Magnesium Salt of Fatty Acid [C16 to C18] and contains no trans fatty acids. Magnesium Stearate contains the equivalent of not less than 6.8 % and not more than 8.3 % of Mg O and is a mixture of pure Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid where the content of Stearic Acid is not less than 40% and the sum of the two acids is not less than 90 %. The British Pharmacopeias 1993 describes Magnesium Stearate as consisting mainly of Magnesium Stearate with variable proportions of Magnesium Palmitate and Magnesium Oleate. Stearic Acid also called Octadecanoic Acid is one of the most common long chain fatty acids, found in both natural animal & vegetable fats, known also by its structural description of being an 18 – Carbon chain fatty acid (18:0) . The FDA has affirmed that Stearic Acid is GRAS ( Generally Regarded As Safe) and can be added to foods in accordance with Goods Manufacturing Practices (GMP), now as a GMP certified manufacturer. Its IUPAC name is Magnesium Octadecanoate with a chemical structure of C36H70Mg O4. MARKET POTENTIAL: Metallic Stearates are used as additives in chemical industries, so as to import certain specific characteristics in product formulations. Important industries using stearates are given below:  Paints and Varnishes,  Cement paints  Leather lacquers and sanding sealers.  Manufacture of compound for PVC Pipes  Rubber Industry  Cosmetics Industry  Pharmaceuticals

 Engineering Industries (wire drawing)  Soap Industry.  Tooth Paste The primary use of Magnesium Stearte is as a pharmaceutical excipient, which means it is among the FDA list of 40 official categories of excipients. It is used as a glidant or granulating agent. A good number of chemical industries in the field of Pharmaceuticals, paints and varnishes, cement paints, cosmetics, PVC pipes manufacture etc. have come into existence throughout the country. These units are using a large quantity of Metallic Stearates especially Calcium Stearate, Zinc Stearate, Magnesium Stearate and Aluminum Stearate. In view of the above future growth of the user industries, the demand for metallic stearates is expected to grow at a faster rate. Stearic Acid is a waxy oil fraction that acts as a lubricant to fill capsules, when a dry powdered ingredient is un cooperative, based on issues involving density, stickiness, flow ability under pressure etc. It is also used as an ingredient that helps tablets hold together and break apart properly. Its major use in the industry as a lubricant, dusting powder, emulsifier, binder, paint and varnish drier etc.. It is used in pharmaceuticals drugs as binder in order to bind tablets and make them smooth. With no side effects known, it is also used as a common additive or preservative in several foods It is an effective emulsifier used in syrups, ketchups, sauces etc. Confectioneries use it for binding candies etc. Baby cosmetic powder use it as it provides a softer texture than talcum powder. When used as industrial binder, it is always taken in lower concentrations. It is an effective binder and even concentrations as low as 5- 15 %. Higher concentrations can cause compaction problems. As a lubricant it is added in the powder blend. This is done so that powder blend does not adhere to the capsule or mould when it become s compact. It is hydrophobic substance i.e. it has negative affinity with water. Hence it can be used in designing firefighting equipments BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: a. The estimates are drawn for a production capacity generally considered techno economically viable for model type of manufacturing activity. b. The production is based on single shift of eight hours and 300 working days per annum. c. The cost in respect of Plan & Machinery has been taken at the time of preparation of Project Profile, which may vary from place to place and time to time. d. The project is based on standard type of manufacturing activity utilizing conventional techniques of production at optimum levels of performance.

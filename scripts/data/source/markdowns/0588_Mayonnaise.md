MAYONNAISE Introduction Mayonnaise informally “mayo” is a thick cold condiment or dressing usually used in sandwiches and composed salads or on chips. It is a stable emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and acid, either vinegar or lemon juice. There are many variants using additional flavourings. The proteins and lecithin in the egg yolk serve as emulsifiers in mayonnaise (and hollandaise sauce). The colour of mayonnaise varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a light cream to a thick gel. It is also a base in sauces such as Tartar sauce. Commercial egg-free varieties are made for vegans and others who avoid chicken eggs or dietary cholesterol. Ingredients Mayonnaise is made from Edible vegetable oil, water, edible common salt, Milk solid, permitted emulsifying & stabilizing agents, permitted acids & permitted antioxidant. Uses of Mayonnaise Mayonnaise is used commonly around the world, and is also a base for many other chilled sauces and salad dressings. For example, mayonnaise is used as sauce in Momos, Sandwiches & also as a salad dressing product. Nutritional Information A typical formulation for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) can contain as much as 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced or nullified. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion. Mayonnaise is prepared using several methods. The nutrient content of mayonnaise (> 50% edible oil, 9–11% salt, 7–10% sugar in the aqueous phase) makes it suitable as a food source for many spoilage organisms. A set of conditions such as p H between 3.6 and 4.0.

Health benefits of Mayonnaise 1. Heart health: Studies have found that the vitamin E content in mayonnaise can prevent heart strokes. 2. Helps absorb nutrients better: Being both high in good fat and vitamin E means that eating mayonnaise in moderation can help you take in all of these important nutrients. 3. Lowers cholesterol: The healthy fats in mayonnaise can help lower your cholesterol. 4. Vitamins and minerals: Mayonnaise is “rich in vitamin K, E and minerals such as potassium, selenium and also sodium.” Description of Mayonnaise Machine The consistency and properties of mayonnaise can be finely tuned with a mayonnaise emulsifier such as our Z Emulsifier or an HV, depending on the desired qualities. Prior to the industrial revolution, most mayonnaise were made by hand in small shops. Today, mostly mayonnaise is manufactured by continuous, high capacity extruders, which operate on the auger extrusion principle in which kneading and extrusion are performed in a single operation. Mayonnaise Market Analysis According to the report "India Mayonnaise & Salad Dressing Market Outlook, 2023" the mayonnaise and salad dressing market of the country has grown with a CAGR of more than 20%, and is expected to grow to value more than INR 800 crores in the forecasted year 2022-2023. The market is segmented into organised and unorganised as well as retail and institutional sales. Mayonnaise has more than 4 types whereas salad dressing has more than 14 variants. In both markets, institutional sales dominate the market as institutions widely used them in their recipes. But with the passage of time, mayonnaise is gaining popularity among consumers due to its variants like mint mayonnaise, garlic mayonnaise, tandoori mayonnaise which is specially created for Indian cuisine. Overall retail sales and institutional sales have ration around 40 is to 60 in the year 2016-2017. It is also expected that various other flavours, along with new uses will be discovered in future, because of which, the market for salad dressing will grow.

Mayonnaise Manufacturing Process Commercial mayonnaise production is often a two-step process. In the first step, oil is coarsely dispersed in a pre-mix tank along with the other required ingredients. The resulting pre-mix is then transferred from the tank in a flowing stream through an emulsifying machine to finely sub-divide the oil into droplets The sub-division or oil into fine droplets forms a densely packed (i.e. space- filling) structure that creates a high viscosity oil-in-water emulsion. High viscosity is a desirable quality for mayonnaise because it improves the level of stability in the product. The physical structure formed while mayonnaise processing is largely dependent on the product’s oil volume fraction and droplet size distribution. The densely packed structure of oil droplets determines the consistency and rheological properties of a mayonnaise. The smaller the droplets are, the more densely packed the mayonnaise structure becomes, resulting in higher viscosities. So if a stiffer mayonnaise is desired, smaller oil droplets are necessary. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Description Quantity Value Mayonnaise Machine 1 1,25,000 Fully Automatic Packaging Machine 1 85,000 Total Cost 2 2,10,000 * Machine Value is Exclusive of GST & other transportation cost. Labour Requirement: 3 Manpower are required for the Mayonnaise unit. Includes: 2 Skilled Labour 1 Unskilled Labour Land &Building required: Land required 450-500 Square Feet (approx.) Approximate rent for the same is 10000 per Month.

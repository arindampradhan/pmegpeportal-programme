TENNIS BALL MAKING UNIT Introduction: Tennis ball is a ball designed for the sport of Tennis. Tennis is a four-point game played on a court and which is divided in the middle by a net. For playing this game, a ball is hit by players (two or four) on both sides in such a way that it goes to others side without touching the net and falls in the specified marked area of the court. This ball is known as Tennis Ball. These balls are made of vulcanized rubber and covered with Melton cloth, which has high wool content or Needle cloth, which is cheaper to produce and can have a greater content of synthetic fibres. It is available in white or optic yellow. Tennis balls are fluorescent yellow in organized competitions but in recreational play can be virtually any color. Tennis balls are covered in a fibrous felt which modifies their aerodynamic properties, and each has a white curvilinear oval covering it.

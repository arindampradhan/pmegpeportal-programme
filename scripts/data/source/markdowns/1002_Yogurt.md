YOGURT PLANT INTRODUCTION India has been the leading producer and consumer of dairy products worldwide since 1998 with a sustained growth in the availability of milk and milk products. Dairy activities form an essential part of the rural Indian economy, serving as an important source of employment and income. India also has the largest bovine population in the world. However, the milk production per animal is significantly low as compared to the other major dairy producers. Products produced from milk is Known as Dairy Products. They are rich sources of energy. Raw milk for processing generally comes from cows, but occasionally from other mammals such as goats, sheep, and water buffalo. Water is the main constituent of milk (about 90%). Yogurt Yogurt also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. The fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavour. Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally. The milk used may be homogenized or not, even pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially different results. To produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 °C (185 °F), to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds. After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 °C (113 °F)

Yogurt market potential India Yogurt Market is projected to witness robust growth at a CAGR of over 20% by 2023, due to easy availability of raw materials like milk and starter culture due to flourishing dairy industry in the country. ‘Dahi’ or ‘Curd’ has been consumed in India since ages, whereas Yogurt is a relatively newer term in the Indian Market. Yogurt is considered beneficial for gut as well as digestive health due to the presence of pre-biotic bacteria and thus possess plethora of health benefits. Growing awareness of the health benefits associated with the consumption of yogurt has led to increasing popularity of yogurts such as frozen yogurt among kids as well as youngsters which will ensure robust growth of the market during the forecast period. Moreover, the growing preference of flavoured yogurts as desserts over sugary sweets or ice-creams is expected to drive the growth of the India Yogurt market in the next five years. Further, factors such as rising disposable incomes, growing awareness of lifestyle diseases, introduction of newer products in the market by manufacturers and presence of national as well as international players that are focusing on innovation is anticipated to propel the growth of India Yogurt Market by 2023. Based on the type, the regular yogurt leads the market, owing to high use of regular yogurts. Based on the distribution channel, the supermarkets/hypermarkets segment holds the largest market share due to easy availability, a huge variety and discounted prices. Analysis about Yogurt Processing Plant Process of yogurt processing plant is depends upon the following aspects. Per day capacity of the plant. For example: 500 liter/day, 1000 liter/day, 2000 litre/ day etc.  Availability of milk in a particular area.  Potential buyer of the final product & their demand.

Yogurt Manufacturing Process Step1: Procurement Procurement of raw milk. Step 2: Milk Reception Area After procurement step bring the milk to the milk reception &cool the milk, so that life span of the milk can be increased & it can be used for further processing. Step 3: Pasteurization After that the main processing of by product starts &put the cooled milk into the inoculation tank and boil the milk at 80o C - 90o C (depends upon the pasteurization). Then again cool it at 4o C. Pasteurization machines are of two types: 1. Slow online pasteurization 2. Continuous online pasteurization Step 4: Homogenization  We used Offline cream separator with pasteurization machine this helps to remove fat from milk and used for the production of the milk.  Online homogenizer is attached with the pasteurization machine. This breaks the fat part and mixed in the milk.  It is used for manufacturing of curd. Step 5: Distribution of pasteurized milk in different tanks After that milk is transferred into different sections like pouch milk, curd processing, paneer processing.

Curd/yogurt Milk is boiled at 92o C and then we thermize it & add culture into that. Step 6: Packaging After that prepared yogurt is sent to packaging section & then taken into the incubation room to make it thick in form. Then we take curd to the Blast room where the temperature is decreased from 45o C to 20o C. Step 7: Cold room Then the product are transferred into cold rooms where the temperature is below 4o C Step 8: Distribution After that yogurt is transferred through transportation into different areas. Insulation vehicle is required if the final product is transported above 40 – 50 KM.

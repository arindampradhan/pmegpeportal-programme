MOSQUITO REPELLENT MOULDS Introduction Mosquito repellents are substances that are designed to make surfaces unpleasant or unattractive to mosquitos. They typically contain an active ingredient that repels mosquitos as well as secondary ingredients, which aid in delivery and cosmetic appeal. They are available in many forms, from creams to lotions to oils, but are most often sold as aerosol products. Mosquito control manages the population of mosquitoes to reduce their damage to human health, economies, and enjoyment. Mosquito control is a vital public-health practice throughout the world and especially in the tropics because mosquitoes spread many diseases, such as malaria and the Zika virus. Mode of Action Most repellent chemicals work by interfering with the mosquito's homing system. This homing system, located on the antennae, is made up of a number of chemical receptors. Research has shown that these chemical receptors are activated by lactic acid, which naturally evaporates from the skin of warm-blooded animals. The mosquitos have the innate ability to follow the lactic acid emissions to their source. However, when a repellent ingredient such as DEET is applied to the skin, it also evaporates. It is thought that the chemical inhibits the binding of the lactic acid to the mosquito's chemical receptors. This essentially "hides" the protected person from the mosquito. Since the active ingredient must evaporate from the surface to work, the repellent activity lasts for a limited time.

Ingredients some of the important ingredients of Mosquito Repellent include – Polypropylene, glass filled nylon. Description of Mosquito Repellent Machine Main Machinery for Mosquito Repellent includes the following:  Injection Moulding Machine  Packaging machine (Automatic/ Normal) These Machines are used to produce Mosquito repellent from different types of raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span. Mosquito Repellent Market Analysis Mosquito Repellent Market is expected to garner $4.8 billion by 2022, registering a CAGR of 7.7 % during the forecast period 2016 - 2022. Wide variety of chemical and natural ingredient based mosquito repellents are being used to keep the mosquitoes away and prevent mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika virus, and others. Popularly used chemical ingredients in the preparation of mosquito repellents include diethyl carbonate, ethyl hexane diol, N-diethyl-3- methylbenzamide (DEET), and diethyl phthalate. Moreover, natural substances such as Lemon Eucalyptus Oil, Lavender, Cinnamon Oil, Soybean Oil and others are used in herbal repellents. Adoption of such natural ingredients based mosquito repellents is increasing to avoid problems such as skin rashes, allergies and others. The world mosquito repellent market is expected to register notable growth in the near future attributed to rise in incidence of mosquito- borne diseases and global warming, which facilitates breeding of mosquitoes. Other factors that drive the market are rising health awareness, government initiatives for mosquito control, and affordable cost of repellents. However, presence of toxic chemicals, such as DEET, in various mosquito repellent products causes ill

effects on health, which is likely to restrain the growth of this market. Huge opportunities prevail for the world mosquito repellent market owed to rising demand for plant based repellents and increasing penetration in untapped markets of rural regions. Mosquito Repellent Manufacturing Process  Take the different types of plastic granules.  Put the granules in the moulding machine with liquid chemicals.  After that the mould gets heated up and the plastic converts into the desired shapes.  Now, they are cooled down from the mould and kept separately.  Packaging & transportation of goods. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Name Cost Injection Moulding Machine 12,00,000 Packaging machine 2,00,000 Total 14,00,000  Cost of the machine is exclusive of GST & value of the machine varies with the change in batch size. Land &Building required: Land required 800-1200 Square Feet (approx.) Approximate rent for the same is Rs. 20000- 24000 per month.

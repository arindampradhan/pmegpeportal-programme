LED LIGHTING SYSTEMS INTRODUCTION A light emitting diode (LED) is a device which converts electrical energy in to light. LEDs are preferred light sources for short distance (local area) optical fiber network because they are inexpensive, robust and have long life (the long life of an LED is primarily due to its being a cold device, i.e. its operating temperature being much lower than that of, say, an incandescent lamp), can be modulated (i.e. switched on and off) at high speeds. A light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead semiconductor light source. It is a p– n junction diode, which emits light when activated. When a suitable voltage is applied to the leads, electrons are able to recombine with electron holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.

The key strength of LED lighting is reduced power consumption. LED’s are available with at the most Lumen efficiency of 110 Lm/Watt compared to 65- 80 Lm/Watt of CFL and FTL, 45 Lm/Watt of Mercury vapour and 75 Lm/Watt of metal halide or 94 Lm/Watt of Sodium Vapour. LED tube light could replace for traditional fluorescent tubes in the following places like hotels, hospitals, factories/offices, commercial complexes conference/ meeting rooms, schools/colleges/universities, residential/institution buildings. Thus, due to demand it is a good project for entrepreneurs to invest. FINANCIAL ASPECTS

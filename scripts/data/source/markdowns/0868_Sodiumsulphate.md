PROJECT REPORT ON SODIUM SULPHATE INTRODUCTION: Sodium sulphate is the sodium salt of sulphuric acid. When anhydrous, it is a white crystalline solid, the decahydrate Na SO ꞏ10H O has been known as Glauber's salt. 2 4 2 Sodium sulphate is mainly used for the manufacture of detergents and in the Kraft process of paper pulping. About two-thirds of the world's production is from mirabilite, the natural mineral form of the decahydrate, and the remainder from by-products of chemical processes such as hydrochloric acid production. Sodium sulfate is chemically very stable, being unreactive toward most oxidizing or reducing agents at normal temperatures. Sodium sulfate is a neutral salt, which forms aqueous solutions with p H of 7. The neutrality of such solutions reflects the fact that Na SO is derived, formally 2 4 speaking, from the strong acid sulfuric acid and a strong base sodium hydroxide. 3

Its specific gravity is 1.464 and melting point is 888ºC. It loses the water of hydration at 100ºC. It is neutral, non-toxic and highly soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol and noncombustible. Anhydrous sodium sulphate is odorless, bitter saline taste, soluble in water and glycerol. MARKET POTENTIAL: Sodium Sulphate is used as raw material in the manufacture of Kraft paper, paper board and glass. It is also used as filler in synthetic detergents, Sodium salts, Ceramic glazes, Processing textile fibres, dyes, tanning, pharmaceuticals, freezing mixtures laboratory reagent and food additive, sodium sulphate decahydrate is used in solar heat storage and air conditioning. With growing demand of above items the product has good market. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: The profile is drawn on the basis of following presumptions- (i) No. of shifts per day 1 (ii) Working Hours per shift 8 (iii) Working days per annum 300 (iv) Working efficiency 60% (v) Margin money 10% of capital investment (vi) Rate of interest on fixed & Working Capital 11.50% 3

TECHNICAL ASPECTS: PROCESS OUTLINES: Sodium Chloride (Common Salt) and concentrated Sulphuric Acid are heated in a furnace at high temperature and thereby Sodium Sulphate in the form of niter cake is formed. Hydrochloric Acid gas formed during the process is absorbed in water in fibre glass re- in forced plastics absorption tank. The nitre cake formed is dissolved in water as saturated solution. Decahydrate sodium sulphate is crystallized by evaporating the water. QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS: Bureau of Indian Standards as formulated Indian Standard Specifications as follows- IS : 255 – 1982 (Second Revision) Sodium Sulphate Anhydrous Reaffirmed 1999 (Technical Grade) IS: 256 – 1972 (1st Revision) Sodium Sulphate Reaffirmed 1999 Decahydrate (Glauber Salt) PRODUCTION CAPACITY (PER ANNUM): Quantity 420 M. T Sodium Sulphate 567 M. T Hydrochloric Acid (By product) 3

POLLUTION CONTROL NEEDS: The unit comes under the category of polluting Industries and thus a small effluent treatment device has to be installed under the able guidance of State Pollution Control Board. ENERGY CONSERVATION: Proper maintenance of machinery and judicial use of them will conserve energy. Proper maintenance of power operated machines and judicious use of them will conserve energy. However, pipelines of boiler shall be properly insulated and priority should be given to install energy efficient machinery and equipment. MOTIVE POWER REQUIREMENT: 32 KVA 3

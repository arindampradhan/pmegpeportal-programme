PROJECT REPORT ON RED IRON OXIDE INTRODUCTION: Red iron oxide finds wide application in paints, plastics, rubber, ceramic and other industries, since huge quantities of spent pickle liquor from steel industries is obtained as a byproduct in our country and contains an average of 15-20 % of ferrous sulphate. Three methods are developed for converting ferrous sulphate content of these liquors into Iron Oxides, suitable for use in pigments. These primers are fairly good water resistance, they are widely used in structural steel work such as bridges and in industries to avoid corrosion on various articles.

MARKET POTENTIAL: It has wide applications in Iron Industry, polishing, pigment, biomedical etc. According to the recent survey carried out on Red Iron Oxide the demand is more than the production i.e. the available product is unable to meet the demand. Therefore, it is suggested to establish few more new units to produce Iron Oxide so as to fill p the gap between the demand and production. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: (i) The profile is based on single shift basis and 300 working days in a year. (ii) All the operations are proposed to be carried out within the industry premises. (iii) Costs of machinery and equipments indicated refer to a particular make and approximately to those prevailing at the time of preparation of this project. (iv) Cost of installation and erection is taken @ 10 % of cost of machinery & equipment. (v) Depreciation has been considered as 15% on plant and machinery and 10 % on office furniture and fixture. (vi) Interest on total capital investment has been taken @ 11.5 % per annum on borrowing amount. TECHNICAL ASPECTS: PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE: - (i) In the first method the ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is reacted with sodium carbonate at moderate temperature. The reacted mass is then treated with water when sodium sulphate dissolves leaving a residue of iron Oxide. The solution containing sodium sulphate is decanted and Iron Oxide is washed to make it free from sodium sulphate and at last it is dried. Sodium Sulphate is recovered by evaporation and crystallization.

(ii) In the second method the crystals of ferrous sulphate obtained from spent liquor are calcified with lime to produce a range of pigments called Venetians reds which contain varying proportions of ferric oxide and calcium sulphate. The products are then pulverized and classified. Blends of this product are made by further addition of calcium sulphate or other extenders to get various varieties of product having ferric oxide between 35-40%. Quality Control & Standards: - Bureau of Indian Standards has formulated a Standard Specification for Red Iron Oxide for various purposes as mentioned below- IS - 44 – 1991 IS - 05 – 1994 Production Capacity (Per Annum) Quantity 300 MT Pollution Control Needs: The unit does come under the polluting Industries, however, necessary clearance from State Pollution Control Board is required to run a manufacturing enterprise. Energy Conservation. Proper maintenance of power operated machines and judicious use of them will conserve energy and proper attention should be given to install energy efficient machinery and equipment.

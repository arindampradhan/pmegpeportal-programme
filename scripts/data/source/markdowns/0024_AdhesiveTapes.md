In this period, the industry by and large, depended on domestic resources for materials as well as machinery. This was due to various restrictions on imports. Around the mid 90’s, liberalisation opened the industry further and it began to reflect in the changes in consumers’ consumption pattern. MAKING PROCESS  RAW MATERIAL 1. Polypropylene roll of diff. 2. Natural rubber 3. Zinc oxide 4. Magnesium oxide 5. Phenolic resin 6. Solvent (CSNL and linseed oil) 7.

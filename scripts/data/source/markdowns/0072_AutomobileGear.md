1. INTRODUCTION A gear is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of the power source. Gears almost always produce a change in torque, giving a mechanical advantage through their gear ratio and can also be considered a simple machine. Gears of various type, size and material are widely used in several machines from simple wall clocks and wrist watches to simple machines to complex machines and manufacturing machine tools, to automobiles, aviation, defense, to very large gear boxes are used in large ships, cranes, wind turbines, Railways, aviation, space telescopes to construction machinery, for dam gate operations and heavy weight lifting machines and systems requiring positive and stepped drive. There are several types of gears, among them the simplest type of gear is the Spur gear. They consist of a cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially. Although the teeth are not straight sided, the edge of each tooth is straight and aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. These gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts. No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Gears are very much important in our day-to-day life. Clocks, bicycles, automobiles and heavy-duty industrial machines all rely on common gears and without these, we wouldn’t be able to live the modern, convenient lives we live today. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT Various grades of alloy steels are most commonly used because of their high strength-to- weight ratio and low cost. These are either cast or forged depending on end application. Gear production is done by machining of standard stock items like rods, billets. Numerous nonferrous alloys, cast irons, powder-metallurgy and even plastics are used in the manufacture of gears. The gear blanks are produced by die cast, investment casting, and powder metallurgy etc. processes. The project may select product mix and select gear blank process viz casting / forging to focus the end consumer segments 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Manufacture of gears needs several processing operations in depending upon the material and type of the gears and quality desired. The stages generally are: • Preforming the blank without or with teeth • Annealing of the blank, if required, as in case of forged or cast steels • Preparation of the gear blank to the required dimensions by machining • producing teeth or finishing the preformed teeth by machining • Full or surface hardening of the machined gear (teeth), if required • Finishing teeth, if required, by shaving, grinding etc. • Inspection of the finished gears. Gear blanks and even gears along with teeth requiring substantial to little machining or finishing are produced by various casting processes.

• Sand mold casting: for large cast iron gears, low speed machinery and hand operated devices. • Shell mold casting: Small gears in batches are often produced by this process. • Centrifugal casting: The solid blanks or the outer rims (without teeth) of worm wheels made of cast iron, phosphor bronze or even steel are preferably performed by centrifugal casting. The performs are machined to form the gear blank of proper size. Then the teeth are developed by machining. • Metal mold casting: Medium size steel gears with limited accuracy and finish are often made in single or few pieces by metal mold casting. For general and precision use the cast preforms are properly machined. • Die casting: Large lot or mass production of small gears of low melting point alloys of Al, Zn, Cu, Mg etc. are done mainly by die casting. Such reasonably accurate gears are directly or after little further finishing are used under light load and moderate speeds, for example in instruments, camera, toys. • Investment casting: This near-net-shape method is used for producing small to medium size gears of exotic materials with high accuracy and surface finish hardly requiring further finishing. These relatively costly gears are generally used under heavy loads and stresses. It is estimated that almost 80% of all gearing produced worldwide is produced by using gear blanks cast, forged, in near final shape. Machining: The most common form of gear machining is cutting metal by tools called hob. The hobbing cutters rotate and mesh with gear blank like a meshing gear thereby generating teeth profile on blank. Other processes like gear shaping, milling, and broaching also exist. For metal gears in the transmissions of cars and trucks, the teeth are heat treated to make them hard and more wear resistant while leaving the core soft and tough. For large gears that are prone to warp, a quench press is used. Finishing Processes: Gear-tooth shaving, grinding, honing and lapping is the finishing processes that provide tooth profile correction, accurate tolerances and surface finish. Gear-honing machines produce teeth to reduce the surface roughness of the tooth profile. Gears are lapped on gear-lapping machines after they have undergone heat treatment.

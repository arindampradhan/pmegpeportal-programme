TECHNICAL ASPECTS Process of Manufacture: The manufacturing process involves the following steps: 1. Procurement of Fabrics Procurement of Fabric: Dyed/bleached/printed cotton/synthetic fabrics as per demand are to be procured from the open market. The fabric will be inspected by laying on the inspection table against light before cutting so that unevenness in colour/shade or any other fault, if any visible in the fabric are eliminated. Cutting and Stitching: The inspected fabric is placed on the cutting table in layers and then the different parts of the respective garments are demarked by a chalk as per different sizes. Cutting is carried out by the cutting machine. Stitching is carried out for individual portion of the garments by skilled workers with the help of over-lock, lock stitch machines etc. Washing, Checking, Pressing and Packing: All garments are charged into washing machine containing mild detergent and washed for 4 hours in order to remove dirt and stains acquired during the manufacturing process. After washing, the garments are hydro extracted to remove excess water and after this, these garments are dried in tumbler dryer. Final checking is done before pressing and packing on the checking table so that any fault in the piece may be removed and protruding threads eliminated. The individual pieces are pressed by steam presses to remove any wrinkle marks and packed in the carton boxes. QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARD: The quality of garments mainly depends on quality of fabric used. Therefore, care must be taken while purchasing fabrics to ensure good colourfastness properties, uniformity in shade etc. Generally garments are made as per customer's specification in respect of size, design and fashion. 4

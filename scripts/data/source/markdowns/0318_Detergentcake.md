Dishwashing detergent cake: These detergent cakes provide the chemical energy to help clean and remove food soil from different types of cooking and serving items. Modern day, dishwashing detergents rinse and dry dishes and utensils without spots, and have found to be safe for a variety of dishes, glassware, utensils, and more. Description of Detergent Cake Machine Machinery for detergent cake includes the following: Sigma mixture (for mixing of Chemicals) • Plodder • Cutter • DIE • Manual packaging & Stamp • Detergent cake Machines are used to produce detergent cake from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, cutting & die completes in a very short span. A control button for handling the device is attached in the machine, so that one can control its speed while operating the machine. Detergent cake Current Market Analysis According to India Detergent Market Outlook, 2021, the overall market for detergent is growing with a CAGR of 13.06% from the last five years. Detergents are available in three forms, namely powder detergent, detergent cake and liquid detergent. The detergent industry in India is mostly captured by organized players, but unorganized regional players have a significant hold on the rural areas. Ghadi, Nirma and Jyothy Laboratories are the major players in the organized market. They have popular brands like Surf Excel, Active Wheel, Rin, Tide, Ariel and Mr. White in their product portfolio. On the basis of pricing, the organized detergent cake market can be further divided into three categories, such as popular (economy), mid- range and premium. Domestic market of detergent cake is also increasing rapidly.

Detergent cake Manufacturing Process • Take the raw material like dolomite, soda ash, sodium silicate etc. & put it into the mixer step by step. The procurement of raw material depends on the quality parameters set by the producer. • After that raw material to be mixed. The ratio of raw material poured in it depends on quality of the dish bar or cake produced by the manufacturer. • After that start the machine & wait for 40-45 minutes & add slurry into it. For 100 KG capacity approx. 5-6 litre water is required. The quantity of water depends upon the moisture level. • Now add the foam booster in it, then add colour after that close the valve for 20 minutes after that add sodium silicate & leave it for 5 minutes, • After that add 2 litres polymer & 0.5 litre liquid fragrance. • Next step is to take the dough from the mixer & put it slowly into the extruder. The extrusion process is the base & important part for detergent cake production. • Fix and adjust the die outside the extruder accordingly. • Now cut the extruded material with the help of cutter according to the specified shape. • Put stamp on it. • Packaging of product. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Name Description Cost Sigma Mixer/ Paddle Mixer 100KG/batch Production 260000 Plodder 4 INCHI 160000 Manual Cutting Platform 12000 DIE 5000 Stamp & Manual Packaging 75000 TOTAL 512000 ❖ Sigma/paddle mixer is also available in the market for 300 & 500 KG batch production and price of machine varies accordingly.

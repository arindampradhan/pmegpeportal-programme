1. INTRODUCTION Alums are hydrated double sulphate salt of aluminum with the general formula X (Al SO ) . 12 2 4 2 H O, where “X” can be a monovalent cation such as the Potassium or the Ammonium cation. 2 However, the tripositive ion, aluminum, are also replaced by Chromium and Iron ions. The name “Alum” is also more generally used for salts with the same chemical formula and structure, except for the fact that aluminum is replaced by other tri-positive metal ions such as Chromium (III), example being Chrome Alum which is K Cr(SO ) ·12H O. Those containing Iron sulphate 4 2 2 are termed as “Ferric Alum” while those that contain Chromium and Aluminum Sulphate are called “Non-Ferric Alum”. By itself, “Alum” generally refers to Potassium Alum with the formula K (Al SO ) . 12 H O. Other alums are named after the monovalent cation that is present 2 4 2 2 in the compound such as the Sodium alum when sodium cation is present, Ammonium alum when ammonium ions are present, etc. These Alums have been used due to their properties since the ancient ages. It was used as a mordant in the Dye Industry during the Islamic Middle ages. Some of the alums occur naturally while some need to be prepared synthetically. The most important mineral that contains Alum is “Alunite” which is hydroxylated Aluminum Potassium Sulphate mineral. Other important alums such as potassium, sodium, and ammonium alums are produced industrially. These processes mainly involve combining aluminum sulphate and any other monovalent sulphate cation. Aluminum sulphate is obtained by treating minerals like Alum Schist, Bauxite, and Cryolite with Sulphuric Acid.

Most of the Alums are soluble in water, they have an Astringent taste, they turns Blue litmus Red, and form Octahedral shaped crystals. In the molecules of the alum, each metal atom is surrounded by six water molecules. When they are heated, then they liquefy, and if the heating is continued, the water of crystallization is driven off, the salts froth and swell and at last only an amorphous powder remains. The cheapest grade of Alum is called “Alum Cake”. Potash Alum is also known as “Alum Alumen”. Though Alum can be recovered from its naturally occurring minerals like Alunite and Kalinite, but they are not much available in India. So in most of the Indian industries, Alum is prepared by co-precipitating equivalent proportions of potassium and aluminum sulphate, where the aluminum sulphate is obtained by treating aluminum ores with concentrated acid. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The different uses of Potash Alum can be given as follows.  The commercial uses of the alum stem from the hydrolysis of the aluminum ions in the alum to form aluminum hydroxide which precipitates out in the medium. In the paper industries, paper is sized by depositing aluminum hydroxide from the alum in the interstices of the Cellulose fiber.  It is used in the water treatment industries (almost 65 % of the Alum goes to the water treatment plants) as the aluminum hydroxide from the alum absorbs the suspended particles in water and thus used as a flocculating agent. For the same reason it is also added to soaps and detergents as well.  In the Clothing industries, it is used as a mordant (binder) to fix the dyes to the cottons and other types of fabrics, rendering the dye insoluble.  Additionally, they are used to make Pickles, in the Baking Powder, in Fire Extinguishers, as Deodorizers, and as Astringents in skincare products and pharmaceutical products.  Potash Alum can also be used to harden the Concrete and Plaster of Paris.

 It is used in the chemical laboratories for the manufacture of a range of other compounds and other purposes. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL The raw materials required for the manufacture of the Alum are:  Bauxite (with 60% Alumina content and less than 3 % Ferric Oxide or Fe O ) 2 3  Potassium Sulphate  Concentrated Sulphuric Acid (60 % concentration)  Potassium Sulphate (99 % pure)  Distilled water  Flaked Glue  Black Ash or Barium Sulphide 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process of Potash Alum has the following steps:  The first step consists washing the procured bauxite and the concentration of the ore. This is done in the Bauxite washing machine to get rid of all the dirt and the impurities.  The second step involves the crushing of the bauxite ore to 1” size pieces in a Jaw Crusher. It is crushed further to 105 – 110 mesh size in a Pulverizer.  In the next step the powdered bauxite with almost 70 – 80 % alumina content and less than 2 % Ferric Oxide content is charged into a lead-lined M. S. reactor vessel. Sulphuric acid of 60 % concentration is slowly added and the reactants are thoroughly agitated by steam. The temperature is kept in between 105 – 110 °C with the help of the steam. Al O + 3 H SO steamAl (SO ) + 3 H O 2 3 2 4 1100C 2 4 3 2  The bauxite is added in excess to achieve maximum conversion. It takes about 8 – 10 hours for the reaction to complete.  When the specific gravity of the reaction mixture reaches 60 degree TW, the solution is supplied to a large settling tank. In the settling tank, Flaked glue is added to enhance the

coagulation of the suspended particles. Barium Sulphide is added in the form of Black Ash to reduce Ferric Sulphate, to obtain a clear solution of Aluminum Sulphate.  After settling, the clear solution of Aluminum Sulphate is filtered in a clean Frame and Plate Filter Press. The pressed cake is then washed with water and the washings termed as “Spent Liquor” can be used in the next process.  An aqueous solution of Potassium Sulphate is now added to the Aluminum Sulphate solution for the crystallization to take place in large mixing tanks  The liquid is then drawn from the mixing tank and sent to the concentrator.  It takes about 8 – 10 hours for the concentration process to take place when a concentrated alum solution is obtained.  In the next step, the concentrated liquid is are transferred to Plastic molds where the liquid further cools and form crystals.  After the Alum is formed, it is dried properly in Fluidized bed Dryers to get rid of all the moisture that is present in it.  Finally, it is sent to the Automatic packaging machines from where required amounts of the product are filled in the bags and then sent to be stored in storage till they are finally dispatched. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 4000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.40000 to Rs.50000 per month.

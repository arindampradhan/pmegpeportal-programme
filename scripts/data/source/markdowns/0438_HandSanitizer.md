HAND SANITIZER PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: Sanitizers are class of substances that are used to disinfect a given surface utilizing their chemical composition which in most cases, is basic in nature which essentially allows the substance to dissolve envelope in case of viruses, cell membrane in case of bacteria as well as some fungus and cell wall in case of some fungus, thus killing pathogen. The Hand Sanitizers are class of sanitizers that are used to disinfect hands as they are one of the most vulnerable parts of human body which is susceptible to pick up pathogens. The hand sanitizers use alcohol to develop the basic nature required to kill pathogens, while components like Vitamin-E and Aloe Vera Gel are used to add skin benefits to the sanitizer.

USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: India hand sanitizer market is projected to surpass $ 43 million by 2025. Growth of hand sanitizer market in India can be attributed to rising awareness about healthy lifestyle & wellness, shifting consumer preference towards convenient hygiene products and rising disposable income. Moreover, the strong marketing activities by leading brands, in addition to huge endorsements, are some other drivers of hand sanitizer market in India. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak has boosted demand for sanitizers like never before across the diverse end user segments. The hand sanitizer market is categorized into Gel, Liquid, Foam and Spray, among which Gel based segment witnessed a faster growth and the segment is expected to grow at a higher rate than other segments throughout the forecast period as well. Gel based segment category held a major part of market share in 2019 due to higher consumer preference. Additionally, due to the strong marketing, and endorsements by celebrities of hand sanitizer products, this category has been witnessing significant growth throughout the historical period and is anticipated to maintain stable growth during the forecast period as well. West India dominated the country’s hand sanitizer market in 2019, and the region is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. Some of the major players operating in India hand sanitizer market are Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd., Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Dabur India Ltd., Himalaya Drug Company Pvt. Ltd., ITC Ltd., and others

INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: 1) Land & Building requirement around 1000-1500 sq. Ft. 2) Office Furniture and fixtures. MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Machinery Requirement are as follows: • Storage Tank [Pressure Vessel Class-1] • Storage Tank [Pressure Vessel Class-3] • Reactor Vessel with Stirrer [Stirrer Vessel] • Dilution Reactor Vessel • Weighing and Metering Equipment [Quantity = Number of Constituent Materials + 1] • Filling Machine • Torque Gun with Vacuum Attachment • Centrifugal Pumps • Alcohol Concentration Meter • Chemical Lab [Quality Control] Note: Plant Capacity is 500 ltr Per day. RAW MATERIAL: Basic Raw material requirement are as follows: • Concentrated Isopropyl Alcohol [Essential] [Main Anti-Pathogenic] • Distilled Water [Essential] [Solvent] • Neem Extract [Optional] [Antibacterial] • Peppermint Extract [Optional] [Anti-Pathogenic] • Clove Oil [Optional] [Antibacterial] • Carbopol 940 [Essential] [Thickening Agent] • Triethanolamine [Essential] [Solubilizing Agent]

## Page 6

• Glycerine [Essential] [Emollient] • Polysorbate 20 [Essential] • Preservative [Essential] • Perfume [Essential] [Emulsifier] • Sanitizer Bottles MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Various raw material as mentioned above are procured from appropriate vendors and stored in appropriate pressure vessels based on the class of chemicals they fall under for example concentrated Isopropyl Alcohol is an extremely corrosive and hazardous chemical thus requires a class-1 Pressure vessel, while distilled water is non-corrosive and nonhazardous thus requires class-3 pressure vessel for storage. As all the raw materials are chemicals thus a chemical lab quipped with qualitative and quantitative analysis apparatus and reagents for all raw material is required so as to ensure proper manufacturing of hand sanitizer. Therefore before manufacturing process starts, all the raw material are tested for their composition and concentration. After verification of all raw materials through chemical lab, the alcohol is supplied to dilution reactor vessel where distilled water is added to it from their respective storage pressure vessels in metered quantities using their respective weighing and metering equipment (Flow Meter is used in case of most Semi-Automated and Fully Automated Plants). The concentration of alcohol can be anywhere between 60% to 70% depending upon other raw materials to be used, this solution is then supplied to stirrer vessel through an appropriate weighing and metering equipment along with various other raw material through their respective weighing and metering equipment’s in definite quantity in appropriate sequence while stirrer is still operating in controlled pressure and temperature condition.

The most fundamental sequence involves Diluted Alcohol, Solubilizing Agent, Emulsifier, Emollient, Thickening Agent, Fragrance, Other Additives and Preservatives; this sequence can be altered based on special raw material or additives properties. Once the solution has stabilized, hand sanitizer is obtained from stirrer vessel; this solution is supplied to filling machine which fills this solution into sanitizer bottles followed by which caps can be either manually attached or by utilizing a torque gun with vacuum attachment. Hand Sanitizer bottles are then sent to label pasting machine which applies label of its ingredient, life and company information followed by which they are packaged and sent to sale. An appropriate sample size from each lot is sent to chemical lab to ensure composition of product prior to sale. APPROVALS & REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT: Basic registration required in this project: ✓ License from the Food and Drug Control Authority (FDCA) ✓ GST Registration ✓ MSME Udyog Aadhar ✓ Trademark or Brand name as may be required by the manufacture ✓ IEC Code for Import Export ✓ Barcode for E-Commerce

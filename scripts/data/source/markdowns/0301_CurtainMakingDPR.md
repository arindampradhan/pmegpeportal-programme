CURTAIN MAKING UNIT Introduction: Beautifying one’s house has been an ancient tradition since ages; the rich do it with expensive materials while the lower income households too decorate their homes in their own creative ways. To cover your windows and to obscure any unpleasant spaces, curtains are an essential fixture. There is no doubt that window curtains are not only a necessity but are also a decorative accessory that plays an important role in elevating the decor. When it comes to event decorations, using backdrop curtains is a thoughtful choice. Other than providing their basic function of covering windows or event venue walls, curtains have several other significant benefits as well. Curtains can also be used to create a segregated area. A room divider curtain can help you separate areas without confining space. Other room divider options tend to make the room smaller, whereas living room curtains are flexible and can easily be drawn to divide the area when needed. Uses & Market Potential: Curtains provide protection from external elements such as weather changes, UV light, etc. To cover your windows and to obscure any unpleasant spaces, curtains are an essential fixture. There is no doubt that window curtains are not only a necessity but are also a decorative accessory that plays an important role in elevating the décor. Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.

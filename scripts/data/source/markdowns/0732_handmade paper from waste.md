PROJECT REPORT On HAND MADE PAPER FROM WASTE INTRODUCTION The history of paper dates back to the history of human culture and civilization. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans used a different kind of paper called `papyrus’. To-day’s kind of paper was first developed and used by China and spread to other countries. Growth of human population, need for transfer of knowledge, education and information within the society at large were forcing factors for innovations and notable increase on the production of paper. Modern paper making began in early 19th century in Europe. All most all paper is manufactured using trees as primary source of wood pulp. Paper manufacturing continues to be a concern in modern times from an environmental perspective due to its use of large number of trees, harsh chemicals, huge water consumption resulting in ecological imbalances, pollution and contamination risks. Eco-friendly paper is a solution to solve all environmental related problems. Though some tools and equipment are used in making eco-friendly, paper it is still called traditionally as a handmade paper only all over the world. It is a paper that does not utilize wood for its manufacturing – is free from all chemicals and is dried using most eco-friendly means of energy – it is a bio-degradable product.

Handmade paper making in India begin in 3rd Century B. C. This paper making has been a traditional art which has been passed through generation by craftsmen known as `Kagzis’. The name being derived from the world `Kagaz’ meaning paper. Through these are now almost extinct except in small pockets like Jaipur, the handmade paper making is fast developing in several parts of our country and now it gained a status of commercial venture and a sound business proposition. The demand for handmade paper and its product is fast growing in the domestic as well as international market. NIRD&PR identified this project as one of the important activities that creates employment among unskilled and semi skilled people, provide regular source of income, develops entrepreneurship among youth, encourage recycling of waste, produce biodegradable products and above all helps to create an eco-friendly environment. Eco-friendly handmade paper making A survey shows that for the manufacture of 1 ton of paper 277 Eucalyptus or 462 bamboo plants are required. On the other hand 100000 greeting cards on hand made paper can save 500 trees. The concern about disappearance of forests, coupled with renewed interest in quality of paper generated new study on the paper makers materials especially the pulp and fibers. According to KVIC experiences “Handmade paper product is a real treasure with full of creative, innovative and thought provoking ideas and the industry got an excellent future because of value addition and export oriented prospective”. Handmade paper has the advantage of being 100% wood free which makes it most eco- friendly form of paper. Handmade paper is excellent for writing as well as printing. It has greater tensile, bursting, tearing and double fold strength compared to conventional papers. Handmade paper is eco-friendly, bio-degradable, recyclable, the best in quality as well as utility and above all availability at an affordable cost. Demand for Handmade paper The handmade paper industry in India offers considerable potential to meet the increasing demand for paper products in an environmentally sound way. People are moving to maximize the use of handmade and recycled paper to generate a reverse chain reaction. Undoubtedly the use of eco-friendly paper ushers in a self sustainable society. Handmade paper is used for office stationary, writing pads, conference folders, computer printouts, drawing and documentation sheets, certificate and degree awards, for making fancy products and diaries, for making photo frames, paper bag and variety of other decorative and show case products. The countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines have already emerged as “Hand made paper giants”. There has been phenomenal growth in the export market for Indian handmade paper and its products especially in developed countries like USA, German, Europe, Australia etc. One estimate shows that in India only about 20% of waste paper is being currently recycled annually which is very low in comparison to 73% in German, 69% in Sweden, 60% in Japan,

Commissioners, CEOs need to be approached for getting large scale orders for the supply of handmade paper products. All State institutes of Rural Development (SIRDs) start using eco-friendly handmade products for their routine stationary items and replace all plastic and synthetic items like bags with handmade paper products. These products may be used as best example by our SIRDs to take forwards the campaign of Swatch Bharat, environmental care and protection and recycling of waste. With such an aggressive marketing strategy the sales would increase to profitable level within a short time. The manufacturing and sales unit may explore opportunities for exports business also. The manufacturers engage continuously in product innovation and invention to capture business from variety of customers. CONCEPT AND SCOPE A real fact in today’s world is that one tone of mill made paper cost our earth 270 trees or 400 bamboo plants. Therefore, today there is a focus on usage of handmade papers. This proposal deals with the Project for manufacturing Handmade Papers. These handmade papers may be converted into different items for daily use such as bags, files, folders etc. Now a days there is a good market for handmade paper since the products of handmade are eco friendly, free from destructive chemicals and non-Toxic. It’s also an employment generative activity. It’s one of the preferred industries since investment is comparatively lower than any such allied industrial units. At the same time this handmade unit has potential to generate good profits.. It needs around 4000 sq. feet land to construct a work shed and any one can run the unit with about 6 persons. Depending upon the handmade papers design and thickness and other features the sale value increases or decreases for products. It is one of the oldest methods of making paper. Generally, it was made by sifting pulp on to a screen and letting each individual sheet of paper dry. But it was time consuming and mainly used in Nepal, Japan, China and Thailand for centuries to produce exceptionally beautiful paper. Now, handmade paper is a delicate customized special product. Handmade papers are mainly used in handmade paper conversion units. These papers gets converted into gift cards, wrapping paper, photo albums, wedding invitation, collages and picture frames etc. Therefore, so much of emphasis is being given on handmade paper manufacturing units. To reiterate, some of the features of handmade paper are mentioned below:- 1. It has an elegant and exquisite surface for writing. 2. It has indestructibility and superb strength for performance. 3. It has unmatched texture for drawings by artists or engineers 4. It comes in colors of fancy varieties for decorative wraps.

Location of the Project This unit can be established at any rural, semi urban as well as urban location. Land area of about 4000 sq.ft, with water facility is good enough to run this industrial unit. b. Raw materials Waste cotton rags Jeans waste cuttings old rope Jute bag waste or jute waste Waste paper Office record waste paper Waste cuttings Hosiery & Tailor cuttings vegetable matter (including leaves, tree moss, flowers) potatoes, Agro-waste fibers like Bagasse Banana, Mulberry, Hemp Liquid rosin soap alum bleaching powder adhesive (fevicol) colour d. Utilities i. Power: The total requirement of the unit is 36 HP ii. Water: The water requirement of the unit for the production of 80 Kgs per day i.e. 12000 liters. iii. Effluent Treatment: The effluent discharged from handmade paper plant contains only very insignificant quantity of chemicals. The total chemicals used are lesser than 3% of the total weight. The waste water effluent will be treated before discharge to nearby agro forms or drainage e. Technology and manufacturing process i) Plant and Machinery The standard equipment is available for handmade paper production. The important among them are: (a) Rag chopper- It is used for cutting the rag into fine pieces suitable for beating in beater machine. Beater Machine-The pulp from the pulper machine sent to beater machine for the formation of fine pulp which plays an important role for formation of board of good quality. Auto Vat - used for the forming of paper sheets in the traditional Indian manner. A measured quantity of diluted pulp is spread evenly on to a wire mould, which is clamped in between two wooden deckles in a water tub. The excess water in the pulp is drained mechanically by manual operation. (b) Hydraulic press -- presses the post of newly formed sheets to remove excess water

(c) Calendaring machine-- It’s a series of hard pressure rollers used to form or smoothen a sheet (d) Cutting machine-- Is used for waste cutting (e) Weighing balance-- For weighing or measuring weight of raw materials as well as other required items. MANUFACTURING PROCESS – The process of making handmade paper involves a series of steps that are briefly discussed below. 1. Sorting and dusting: the raw material that is to be used is manually sorted and foreign material like buttons; plastic, synthetic fibers etc. are removed. To remove dust and dirt the material is shaken vigorously. 2. Rag Chopping: The sorted and dusted material is chopped into pieces of equal size. 3. Beating: The raw material is mixed with water and harmless chemicals and beaten in a Hollander beater. This consists of a U-shaped trough, with a drum; on the outer side of this drum are iron blades that cut the raw material to make a pulp out of it. There is a washing drum as well that cleans the pulp and drains the dirty water. The quality of the paper to be made determines the consistency of the pulp. Sheets of handmade paper can be made in two ways. 4. Dipping Method: This method is normally used for fine or thin paper. The pulp is diluted with water and put into a masonry trough or vat. The lifting mould (a mesh on a wooden frame) is dipped into the trough, shaken evenly and lifted out with the pulp on it. The consistency of the pulp in the tank should be kept constant all the time. 5. Lifting Method: This method is used for all paper and especially for card paper. A fixed quantity of pulp is poured evenly onto a mould, which is then clamped between two wooden deckles (frames) and then dipped into a water tank. The mould in then lifted using a lever mechanism that allows the excess water to drain away. 6. Couching: Once the sheet is formed, the wet paper is transferred onto a cloth like muslin or felt sheet and a stack of interleaved sheets in made. 7. Pressing: A hydraulic press is used to remove the excess water from the sheets. Pressing reduces the thickness of the paper and the sheets become more compact. This process improves the physical properties of the paper and helps drying. 8. Drying: Even after the sheets have been pressed, they still contain about 50% to 65% of the moisture. The sheets are hung in the sunlight to dry. Solar dries can speed up the process and the space required for drying. Coloured papers are dried in the shade to prevent the sun from bleaching the color. 9. Cleaning and Sizing: Small particles of dirt and other foreign matter are removed manually with a sharp instrument. The cleaned sheets are coated with a layer of starch to improve the quality of the paper and prevent feathering. This

process is called sizing. This can be done manually using a brush or by dipping the sheet into a vat containing sizing chemicals. 10. Calendaring: The sheets are then placed between metallic plates and passed through spring-loaded rollers in a calendaring machine. This makes the paper smooth and increases the gloss of the paper. 11. Cutting: The sheets are cut neatly according the required size using a cutting machine. f. Inspection and quality control Handmade paper has potential to gain widespread acceptance. provided material is produced and delivered with a high level of consistency, quality and precision. Quality control aspects are more important for the handmade paper units than the rest of the paper industry. In recent years quality control procedures has evolved to some extent. As a part of quality control a unit should at least lay down specifications for purchase of raw materials, should inspect production procedure and should control pulp parameters. Acceptance procedures for pulps can only ensure whether the paper to be produced will be suitable for down line processes till the finishing stage or not. The unit will employ a trained supervisor to take care of quality checks g. Schedule of Implementation The building can be arranged within 3 months period. The machinery can be procured within 4 months period from the date orders are placed. The total project can be completed within 6 months period and production could commence could commence immediately thereafter. COMMERCIAL VIABILITY Handmade paper industry produces paper such as drawing paper for artists, permanent document paper, dark colored card sheets, deckle edged stationery, exclusive greetings, and varieties of fancy decorative wraps, unique paper for carry bags, water mark paper certificates, filter papers and pads besides other cultural grades like covers, duplicating paper and tissue paper. These products have good demand in the domestic market and find usage in the stationery, greeting card, packaging industry and have tremendous unexplored potential in export markets. Superior Variety Handmade Paper like bond paper, Decorative Paper, Drawing Paper, Card sheets, mottled paper, moon rock paper, banana paper and other varieties can be produced. Different varieties of handmade paper can be used for interior decoration, corporate gifts, and office purpose. New attractive varieties of ecofriendly handmade paper have very good demand in India and abroad. On small quantity a special quality handmade paper can be produced and converted in to value added products to earn good profit.

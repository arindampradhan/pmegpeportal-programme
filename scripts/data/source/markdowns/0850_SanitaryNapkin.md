SANITARY NAPKIN Introduction A sanitary napkin, sanitary towel, sanitary pad, menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn in the underwear by women and girls who are menstruating, bleeding after giving birth, recovering from gynecologic surgery, experiencing a miscarriage or abortion, or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina. A menstrual pad is a type of feminine hygiene product that is worn externally, unlike tampons and menstrual cups which are worn inside the vagina. The frequency a woman will need to change her pad will vary depending on whether her menstrual flow is heavy or light. Menstrual pads are made from a range of materials, differing depending on style, country of origin, and brand. US brands include Kotex, Always, Equate, and Stayfree. Lil-lets are available in several other English-speaking countries. These pads are not to be confused with generally higher absorbency incontinence pads, which are worn by people who have urinary incontinence problems or experience stress incontinence. Although menstrual pads are not made for this use, some people use them for this purpose. Uses Menstrual pads are worn to absorb menstrual discharge (and thereby protect clothing and furnishings). They are usually individually wrapped so they are easier and more discreet to carry in a purse or bag. This wrapper may be used to wrap the soiled pads before disposing of them in appropriate receptacles. Some people prefer to wrap the pads with toilet paper instead of (or as well as) using the wrapper, which, often being made of slick plastic with a small tape tab, may not adequately stick. Menstrual pads of any type should not be flushed down the toilet as they can cause blockages. In developed countries, public toilets almost always include a purpose-made receptacle in which to place soiled pads. In first aid, they make excellent dressings for heavy bleeding due to their high absorbency if gauze is unavailable or inadequate.

Benefits of using Sanitary Napkin Fewer health risks than tampons.  Can be worn before your period.  Can be worn with light flow.  Can be worn overnight.  Easier to use than tampons.  Better if you prefer external products.  Allow you to better monitor flow.  Don't increase menstrual cramps.  Description of Sanitary Napkin Machine Sanitary napkin, a universally needed product, has very low penetration in India and other developing countries, partly due to its high price and partly due to the tradition of using cheaper but unhygienic old cloth piece. As a result they become the host of many infectious diseases. This is due to lack of awareness and economic inability for adopting better precautions like use of good sanitary napkins during menstruation period. Usually different varieties of sanitary napkins are found available in the market but they are very expensive and are not affordable for rural & under-privileged women and girls. Product: 1. Pulveriser It is used for Pulverizing Pulp or Cotton. Total manpower for this machine is only 1 single person. It has added advantage over the grinder. There is a difference between pulverizing and grinding. If we pulverize the pulp then it becomes soft but retains its shape in napkin but if we grind it then it cannot retain its shape in a napkin 2. Napkin Press Machine: The napkin pressing machines are available with three powders coated or steel plated dyes that ensure easy operation. These Napkin Pressing machines are easy to fix on the floor or on the table 3. Napkin Sealing Machine: This machine is used to seal the pulp in a fabric. It takes 20 seconds to seal one

4. Gumming Set: This Gumming Set is a type manual screen printing this designing of screen is only used for Sanitary Napkin back side Gumming. Total manpower for this machine is only 2 single persons. This gumming manual machine production capacity is 500 Napkins in 40 minutes 5. UV Treated Sterilizer This UV Treated Sterilizer is of 18 gauge virgin steel with plastic coated in white color with red LED indicator on the top. There are three UV treated ultra-tubes of 12 inches with 12/24 inches mirror inside of the sterilizer so that the reflection the UV tube should reflect in the full sterilizer inner side.

WROUGHT IRON FURNITURE INTRODUCTION: Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon – less than 0.08% content. Wrought iron is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion-resistant and easily welded. The term Wrought Iron is specific to the fibrous, hand-refined material that served historically for millennia as the most used and useful form of iron. It is characterized by its composite structure. In the process of refining, iron and iron silicate are fused together. For most purposes, ductility is a more important measure of the quality of wrought iron than tensile strength. Wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale. At present, most products described as wrought iron, are actually made of hot rolled forgeable steel, viz. Guard rails, garden furniture gates etc. of ornamental designs. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: The so called “Wrought iron furniture” is now made from hot rolled forging grade mild steel having good ductility, is used to make home decor items such as racks, table bases, desks, gates, beds, candle holders, curtain rods, bars and bar stools, fences and railing, with ornate designs.

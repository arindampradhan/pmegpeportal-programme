WOOLEN DARI MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The local artists hand-tuft a variety of hand-knotted woolen carpets or durries. A carpet is a textile floor covering with a pile on top and a backing on the bottom. Tangled twigs make up the majority of the mound. The pile is usually made up of twisted tufts that have been heat-treated to keep their shape. The craftsmen's products are also exported to other parts of the country, resulting in job creation. Beautifying one's home has been an old convention since ages; the wealthy do it with costly materials while the lower pay families also beautify their homes in their own inventive manners. Carpet weaving continues to be a source of livelihood for many artisans in India. The creation of hand hitched carpets is an antiquated craftsmanship that merits a ton of profound respect! The size of the loom relies upon the size of the carpet and the weaving is done from the base to the top. The floor covering weaver embeds the "ties" into the establishment of the mat and they are tied by hand, this makes up the "heap" of the carpet. This is a dull and tedious activity. Hand Tufted mats can be similarly as delightful as hand hitched floor coverings, they normally are not of significant worth to a carpet authority or somebody who is hoping to purchase an Oriental mat as a speculation. Natural wool is utilised in braided wool rugs, which are handmade with hundreds of knots to produce beautiful patterns and motifs.

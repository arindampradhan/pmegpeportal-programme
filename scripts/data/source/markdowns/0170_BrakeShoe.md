BRAKE SHOE MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Brake shoes are part of a drum brake system. Brake shoes are crescent-shaped components with a rough friction material on one side. They sit inside of a brake drum. When the brake pedal is pressed, the brake shoes are forced outward, pushing against the inside of the brake drum and slowing down the wheel. Drum brakes and brake shoes are parts of an older type of braking system and have become less common on modern vehicles. Brake shoes may outlast brake pads due to their location within the system. Since they are positioned in the rear of the vehicle, brake shoes may last longer as they aren't taking as much of the stopping force. Brake shoes are components of the drum brake assembly. They are forced to press against the inner surface of the brake drum. The friction produced between the shoes and the drum works to reduce speed and to stop the motorcycle. Brake shoes are generally thought to be good between 30,000-35,000 miles in urban use. In less demanding situations like highway driving in light traffic, brakes may last 80,000 miles or more.

Uses & Market Potential: Brake shoes carry the brake lining inside brake drum systems. As when they are applied, they tend to stop the vehicle. When the driver applies the brake, a wheel cylinder in the drum brake system forces the brake shoe outward, against the inside of the drum. This creates friction between the lining and drum, causing the vehicle to brake. In the recent past, the automotive industry witnessed significant growth across the globe. Perennial increase in the sales of the passenger vehicle, two- wheeler, and LCV are significantly contributing to the growth of the brake shoe market. Moreover, continuous growing economies, urbanization or residential sector development, and various supportive government policies are attributing towards the production and consumption of automotive in both developed and developing countries across the globe. The rise in the demand for vehicles coupled with the overall rise and expansion of automobile sector, the demand for automotive brake shoe has risen. Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the automotive brake shoe market will show a compound annual growth rate of 7.20% for the forecast period of 2021-2028. Product: Brake Shoe Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Asbestos based friction material  Steel Sheets  Other Chemicals

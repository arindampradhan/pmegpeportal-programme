PROJECT REPORT ON CARBONATED SOFT DRINK INTRODUCTION: Carbonated soft drinks constitute the major category in “Aerated Soft Drinks”, the other two categories being juice based soft drinks and squash, sharbat and syrup. Various types of soft drinks including orange, lime and lemon based drinks as well as soda water fall in the category of aerated soft drinks. These water drinks consist of water, carbon-di-oxide, colour, additives and preservative. In a tropical country like India, which has oppressive summers, there is substantial market for aerated soft drinks. MARKET POTENTIAL: The Indian soft drink market might continue its "robust growth trajectory" as annual per capita bottle consumption is expected to reach around 84 by 2021, according to a report by Pepsi Co India's bottling partner Varun Beverages Ltd The industry would have a broad-based growth across categories, especially helped by juices and bottled water, . It will be helped by key growth drivers such as under-penetration of the segment, growing middle class, rising affordability and urbanization, and rural electrification besides continued innovations towards product packaging and sizing.

"Within carbonates, non-cola carbonates, especially lemon-based ones, are expected to grow faster," said VBL. Carbonated beverages account for 51 per cent of Pepsi Co's sales volumes in India. It further said: "The bottled water category is expected to see a robust volume growth with increasing awareness among consumers about water-borne diseases and shortages in drinking water in the urban areas." Moreover, rising health awareness is also driving juice consumption and it is increasingly becoming part of the regular breakfasts and social gatherings.

factory realization would be about Rs 15.00 to 20 per bottle. Considering that a tiny unit would have to face competition from premier brands, a market penetration price of Average Rs 10/- per bottle i.e. Rs 240/- per crate is considered for orange, lime, lemon drinks soda water etc STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries. The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry. The act brought into force in place of the PFA is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "FSSA") that overrides all other food related laws. FSSA initiates harmonization of India's food regulations as per international standards. It establishes a new national regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as "FSSAI"), to develop science based standards for food and to regulate and monitor the manufacture, processing, storage, distribution, sale and import of food so as to ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board where ever it is applicable. All food imports will therefore be subject to the provisions of the FSSAI and rules and regulations which as notified by the Government on 5th of August 2011 will be applicable. Key Regulations of FSSA A. Packaging and Labeling B. Signage and Customer Notices C. Licensing Registration and Health and Sanitary Permits FINANCIAL ASPECTS

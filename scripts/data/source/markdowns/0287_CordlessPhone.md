1. INTRODUCTION A cordless phone or portable phone is a telephone in which the handset is portable but able to be used like landline phone communication, only it operates by radio frequency transmission and not a physical insulated wire or telephone line. The base station is connected to the telephone network through a telephone line as a corded telephone is, and also serves as a charger to charge the handset's batteries. The range is limited, usually to the same building or some short distance from the base station. A cordless telephone differs from a mobile telephone by the limited range and by the base station on the subscriber premises. Current cordless telephone standards, such as PHS and DECT, have blurred the once clear-cut line between cordless and mobile telephones by implementing cell handoff (handover); various advanced features, such as data transfer; and even, on a limited scale, international roaming. In specialized models, base stations are maintained by a commercial mobile network operator and users subscribe to the service. Unlike a corded telephone, a cordless telephone needs mains electricity to power the base station. The cordless handset is powered by a rechargeable battery, which is charged when the handset is stored in its cradle. Rechargeable batteries in the cordless phone provide hours of available talk time. This phone has a base station and the handset can be used anywhere within a definite distance from the base.

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: A cordless phone can be used at the home, office, Public places, Industrial areas, etc. The global Cordless Phone market is expected to reach USD 395.2 million by the end of 2026. Expanded migration to hosted/cloud-based communications solutions; device-as-a-service (Daa S) conveyance models; and the dependence of different vertical industries on ruggedized or purpose- built cordless phones are the main drivers propelling the growth of the cordless phone market. Better voice quality; improved safety features; and additional features such as remote message pickup from the handset call waiting, caller ID, and two-way paging drive the market. Nonetheless, interference by different device signals and the health impacts of cordless phones impede the market development. PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL The major raw material required for manufacturing of Cordless Phone are: ➢ Plastic: ABS, PVC Plastic granules can be used to make base units and handset cases for cordless phones. ➢ Electrical components: Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Diode, Controller IC, Battery, Battery contacts, Display, Microphone, Speaker, Charging port jack, Customize circuit board, PCB for the handset, etc. ➢ Other: Button pad, Solder wire, Solder paste, Solder flux, wires, etc. MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- 1. Raw material procurement 2. Injection molding process: Plastic molding 3. PCB assembly 4. Assembly 5. Testing

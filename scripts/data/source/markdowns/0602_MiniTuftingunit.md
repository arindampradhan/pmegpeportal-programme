PROJECT PROFILE FOR MINI TUFTING UNIT INTRODUCTION .• PVC backed non-woven mat in 50cm width and different length and pile height and PVC thickness can be adjusted by cutting and doctor blade. Cutting head has a spreading platform for PVC/Latex emulsion and device for controlling its thickness. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE • Hanks of coir yarn are wound into spools by using spool winding machines. Hanks are placed on the flyers supplied with this machine and yarn is taken through yarn tensioners and attached to the empty spools on the winding drum. When the machines start the winding drum rotates and the yarn is wound into spools. The yarn released from the spools is first chopped into equal preset lengths and thickly implanted vertically onto the PVC resin/latex sheet by passing the materials through a chute. The pile height is controlled for achieving the required thickness of the sheet. A conveyor with heat resistant Teflon belt running along the length of the machine and movement of this conveyor is regulated by the belt aligner. The conveyor belt is Teflon 1

0 coated, capable of withstanding temperature up to 250 C, so as to facilitate easy removal of the sheet after cooling. The conveyor in its forward movement passes over the heating oven and cooling zone and by doing so, the bits of coir yarn gets implanted family over the PVC/Latex base and forms the mats. The mat can be rolled out of the machine in continuous length or cutting to mat size by longitudinal and cross cutting. Starting from the creel stand to the delivery end, the machine performs automatically. BASIS AND PRESUMTIONS • The Project Profile is based on 8 working hours for2shifts in a day and 25 days in a month and the Break Even efficiency has been calculated on 55%, 65%, 75%, 85% and 95% capacity utilization. • The rate of interest both for fixed asset and working capital have been taken as 11.5% p.a. TECHNICAL ASPECTS • Installed Production capacity per day : 250 sq.meter Number of Shift per day : 2 Working days p.a : 300 days Capacity Utilization -First year : 55% -Second year : 65% -Third year : 75% -Fourth year : 85% -Fifth year : 95% Rate of Average Sales Realization : Rs. 330 per sq.meter Rate of Average cost of raw material : Rs.300 Interest on term Loan : 11.50% Manpower requirement Interest on working capital : 11.50% Skilled worker : 2 Unskilled worker : 6 Total HP required : 12 HP 2

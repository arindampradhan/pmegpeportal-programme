1. INTRODUCTION Coconut milk is a thick, white milky liquid produced from grated coconut after it has been soaked in boiling water. Its high oil content provides rich taste and color to the milk. It also offers health benefits, such as improving immunity, reducing the risk of cholesterol and heart attacks, and controlling blood pressure. Coconut milk is the liquid in the color of white, which is obtained manually or by mechanical extraction from comminuted coconut meat with or without adding water. Coconut milk is a common ingredient in many tropical cuisines, and It may be consumed raw by itself, or used as a milk substitute in tea, coffee. Coconut milk is rich in proteins such as albumin, globulin, prolamin, and glutelin. Emulsifying agents help in increasing the dispersibility and stability of food emulsions; examples of such are phospholipids, cephalin, and lecithin which have been found in coconut milk. Coconut Milk products are prepared using a significant amount of comminuted coconut meat are expressed, where most filterable fibers and residues are excluded, with or without coconut water, and/or with additional water, thermally processed and hermetically sealed in a container to prevent spoilage.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Coconut milk is healthy, vegan alternative to dairy milk. Coconut milk does not contain lactose and is lower in carbohydrates than dairy milk, which can be consumed by people who are lactose-intolerant or just don't enjoy the taste of dairy milk. Although regular canned coconut milk is higher in calories and fat than whole dairy milk, the plant-based saturated fat in coconut milk may provide health benefits not found in the animal-based saturated fat in dairy milk. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL  Coconuts: Dried whole coconut with husk shell and the core can be procured for coconut milk processing.  Other: Preservatives, Packing Material, etc. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Milk Processing  Packing  Testing

Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done. And it will be stored in a neat and clean area for further processing. Milk Processing  De-husking: Dried coconut with husk will be collected at the de-husking area. Coconut DE husking involves removing the husk from the coconut. Traditional DE husking is time consuming and difficult process. The DE husking or husk peeler machine comprises the usage of two horizontal rollers with a series of sharp tools which would shear the husk from coconut when rolling against each other.  De-shelling: In this process, cracking the outer coconut shell of the fruit after DE husking the coconut will be done. Coconut brown shell will be removed using a coconut de-shelling machine.  Paring: Paring is the process of removing or scrapping off the brown skin from the coconut after cutting the kernel into pieces. This process is done using the coconut paring machine.  Blanching or washing: Pared coconuts are dipped in boiling water for a few minutes in a blanching tank. In this process, the material will be cleaned.  Disintegration/ Coconut Grinding: Desiccated coconut is the disintegrated and dehydrated coconut kernel or pulp largely comprising the white portion of the kernel, after removing the brown Testa or parings. The coconut pieces are ground to a smooth paste called the desiccated coconut. This process is done using a coconut grinding machine.  Coconut Milk Extraction: The shredded or ground desiccated coconut is squeezed completely until all the milk is extracted. A coconut milk extracting machine is employed in this process of extracting coconut milk.  Filtration: the extracted coconut milk is filtered using a vibro screen with a stainless filter of 100 mesh or finer.

 Pasteurization: Filtered coconut milk is pasteurized indirectly by double boiling at 70°C for 15 minutes  Packing: once pasteurization temperature is achieved, the coconut milk is removed from the heat source, immediately transferred to stainless steel filling vessels hot-filled in appropriate containers, and sealed. For coconut liquid products, aseptic packaging can help distribute and store these perishable goods without refrigeration for more than six months. The aseptic packaging system achieves room temperature shelf stability by filling a sterilized package with sterilized coconut liquid products, all within the confines of a hygienic environment. This is different from other systems that use preservatives and refrigeration to prolong the product’s shelf life. Laminated carton packages are the predominant form of packaging for coconut liquid products. Most of these are aseptically packed. Non-aseptically packed coconut liquid products using chilled distribution can also be found. Packed coconut milk is immersed in a cooling tank water bath to bring down the temperature. Storage: coconut milk packed in plastic bottles or pouches is subjected to blast freezing and transferred to freezers for cold storage. Canned coconut milk undergoes sterilization and remains stable at ambient storage after cooling.

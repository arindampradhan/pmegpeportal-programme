## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON ELECTRONIC VIBRATION METERS/ANALYZER Introduction : The electronic vibration meters/analyzers are used to measure and analyzer the intensity of vibration in turbo machinery, generating stations, ships, aircraft, manufacturing plants, water, and sewerage heavy electrical equipments. Vibrations canbe due to unbalance of rotating parts , misalignments or external force. For each of these measurements various types of transducers are used. In general, vibration measurements are made to study the response of a body or structure. Study the vibratory environment surrounding a vibratory source viz., floor monitor and control a system such as in maintaining accelerations at a desired level etc. The vibration meter/analyzer consists of a transducer, signal conditioner and a display system. The transducer converts the mechanical vibration into an electrical signal. The signal conditioner converts the transducer output into a suitable electrical output. The output divices may either be digital display/analog panel meter, graphic recorder, oscilloscope or a magnetic tape recorder. In general application LVDT or piezo-electric transducers are used for vibration measurement. 1 Name of the Product : ELECTRONIC VIBRATION METERS/ANALYZER 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft rented 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 333,000.00 24 pin digital IC tester, Bench drilling machine 1/2" Vibration simulator (Micropower based) , Digital Multimeter 4 1/2 digit , Electronic counter, Fly press, Hand lever shear, High voltage tester/insulation tester, Digital LCR meter, Oscilloscope (50 MHz), Portable Grinder, Power supply 0-30V,5A, Transistor tester, X-Y recorder plotter, Hand Tools/Jigs/Fixtures, Office equipment and furniture , Pre-operative expenses.

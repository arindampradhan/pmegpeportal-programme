ARECA LEAF PLATES MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Chewing betel nuts and betel leaves is a long-standing Indian habit that dates back at least 1000 years. Only a few people chew a mixture of areca nuts, betel leaves, and tobacco. People also eat areca nuts that haven't been dried. Manufacturers of supari employ areca nut as a raw material. Due to widespread areca cultivation, the areca leaf is readily available. In English, it's called areca palm, areca nut palm, or beetle nut palm, while in Indian languages, it's called vakka, adakka, adike, puga, supari, pakku, kamugu, or gua. It belongs to the Aracaceae family and is a medium- sized single-trunked tropical palm with a thin, upright, unbranched solitary stem. China, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the West Indies, and Indonesia are among the countries where it is widely grown. The leaves are long and palmate, measuring 1.5–2 meters in length. The stem is encircled by the sheaths of the leaves, which create a protective covering around it. The leaf sheaths of the Areca Nut Tree are used to make Areca Leaf Plates. Areca leaves are gathered, pressure washed, cleaned, sun dried, and then moulded into suitable shaped plates using heat and pressure. Plates may be utilised as an excellent fertilizer and a good source of organic manure once they have been used. Disposable plates and bowls are a great way to save money. Plastic and paper plates are replaced with disposable plates and bowls.

Uses & Market Potential: Areca leaf plates are manufactured without the use of chemicals in a natural way. To increase the strength of the finished goods, no artificial components are utilised. The leaf products do not react with meals and do not alter the flavour. The leak- proof areca leaf plates come in a variety of forms and sizes, and they can withstand both hot and cold temperatures. Between 2017 and 2021, the global foodservice disposables market is expected to increase steadily. The worldwide foodservice disposables market is expected to generate revenue of $27,187 million by the end of 2021. Disposable plates, cups, trays, bowls, and other things are increasingly being used by restaurants to serve a variety of foods. The majority of restaurants have begun to provide catering services, resulting in a rise in the usage of foodservice disposables. Restaurants can also order bespoke foodservice disposables from manufacturers. In addition, a growing number of consumers are turning to restaurants for catering services, particularly during special occasions. Meanwhile, retail establishments and the hotel industry have begun to use foodservice disposables to supply diverse food products in recent years. The growth

of takeout meals is being fuelled by an increase in the number of eateries in emerging nations. The expansion of foodservice disposables in the Asia Pacific area is being fuelled by an increase in the number of restaurants in emerging nations and the popularity of takeout meals. Furthermore, in the near and medium term, continued urbanisation, sedentary lifestyles, and an on-the-go eating culture are projected to fuel market development. Another aspect that will make it easier for manufacturers to produce biodegradable food service disposables is the availability of raw materials. This will increase the availability of these goods on the market. Growing environmental concerns as a result of the increased use and disposal of paper disposables have given the biodegradable food service disposables industry a lot of room to develop in the future years. Product: Areca Leaf Plates Raw Material: Basic raw material are:  Areca Leaf  Sandpaper Manufacturing Process:  Raw material procurement  Drying  Cleaning  Pressing with heat

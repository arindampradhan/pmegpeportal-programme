SHAMPOO MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction Shampoo is a hair care product, typically in the form of a viscous liquid, which is used for cleaning hair. Less commonly, shampoo is available in bar form, like a bar of soap. Shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair, massaging the product into the hair, and then rinsing it out. Some users may follow a shampooing with the use of hair conditioner. Uses of Shampoo The typical reason of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable. Formulation Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co- surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water. The sulphate ingredient act as a surfactant essentially heavy duty soap that makes it easier to trap oil and grease. Specialty shampoos are marketed to people with dandruff, color- treated hair, gluten or wheat allergies, an interest in using an organic product, and infants and young children ("baby shampoo" is less irritating). There are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain insecticides or other medications to treat skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas. Ingredients Main ingredient of shampoo is surfactant. Other essential ingredients include salt (sodium chloride), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrances.

Qualities of Shampoo  pleasing foam  Ease of rinsing  Minimal skin and eye irritation  Thick or creamy feeling  Pleasant fragrance  low toxicity  good biodegradability  slight acidity (p H less than 7)  no damage to hair  repair of damage already done to hair Many shampoos are pearlescent. This effect is achieved by the addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials, e.g. glycol distearate, chemically derived from stearic acid, which may have either animal or vegetable origins. Description of Shampoo Machine Machinery for Shampoo Unit includes the following:  Mixer tank  Filler Machine Shampoo Machines are used to produce Liquid Shampoo substance from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span. Shampoo Market Analysis Global Shampoo Market is segmented by Product Type (Standard Shampoo, Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Kids Shampoo, Medicated Shampoo and Others), Distribution Channel

(Supermarkets/Hypermarkets, Specialist Retailers, Convenience Stores, Drug Stores and Pharmacies, Online Stores and Others), and Geography. Indians have evolved from a time where “champi” was the sole mean of haircare. Today, a plethora of options are available from shampoos and conditioners to hair dyes, serums and hair colours. According to AC Nielson, the Indian shampoo industry is estimated at INR14 billion and is growing at an average rate of 20% per annum. The shampoo industry is divided on two basic platforms – cosmetic (shine, health and strength), herbal and anti-dandruff. The anti- dandruff segment that grows at 10-20% annually is the fastest growing segment. Shampoo Manufacturing Process The manufacturing process can be broken down into two steps. First a large batch of shampoo is made, and then the batch is packaged in individual bottles. Compounding Large batches of shampoo are made in a designated area of the  manufacturing plant. They are poured into the batch tank and thoroughly mixed. Depending on the formula, these batches can be heated and  cooled as necessary to help the raw materials combine more quickly. Add all the ingredients In the proportionate ratio.  Quality control check After all the ingredients are added to the batch, a sample is taken  to the Quality Control (QC) lab for testing. After a batch is approved by QC, it is pumped out of the main  batch tank into a holding tank where it can be stored until the filling lines are ready. From the holding tank it gets pumped into the filler.

Filling At the start of the filling line, empty bottles are put in a large bin  called a hopper. Here, the bottles are physically manipulated until they are correctly oriented and standing upright. From here the bottles move to the capping machine. Much like  the bin that holds the empty bottles, the caps are also put in a hopper and then correctly aligned. As the bottles move by the caps are put on and twisted tight.

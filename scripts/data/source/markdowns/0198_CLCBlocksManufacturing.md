Cellular Lightweight Concrete Bricks (CLC) INTRODUCTION Cellular Lightweight Concrete Bricks (CLC) is also called as Foam Concrete. It is a version of lightweight concrete which is produced in the same way as normal Concrete under ambient conditions. CLC Blocks are Cement Bonded Material made by blending Slurry of Cement. Stable, pre-formed foam manufactured on site is injected into this slurry to form foam concrete. CLC blocks are made from cellular lightweight concrete or foam concrete. The blocks are easy to install, nail, drill and cut for pipes and conduits. The raw materials to manufacture the CLC blocks are fly ash/sand, cement and protein based foaming agent. These blocks are fire and pest resistant, Low Maintenance, Long- Life, Seismic Resistant blocks used for various applications across the world from last 6 decades.

ADVANTAGES OF CLC BRICKS Low thermal conductivity. Thermal Performances 5 times better than clay bricks & 10 times better than RCC Interiors remain cool in summer and warm in cold wintry days. Savings in recurring energy costs in air-conditioning. Ideal material for applications in cold storage rooms. It is possible to achieve even higher values depending upon the thickness and the plaster. Good Sound Insulation - Up to 37-42db sound reduction based on thickness. Savings in recurring energy costs in air-conditioning. Can fulfill required STC (Sound Transmission Class) rating. Reduction of Dead Load 1/3rd the density of clay bricks. Economic design: savings in cement and steel. Enables faster construction. Suitable for low-soil bearing capacity & seismic zones. Facilitates construction of unplanned walls anywhere anytime. Fire Protection CLC Bricks offer great fire protection. With a just 100mm. thickness of wall 1000 kg/m3, CLC block offers fire endurance for heat transmission for 4 hours without releasing any toxic fumes during.

Enhances Carpet Area An engineered block, it can be offered in any thickness as per the construction design. By using 150 mm thick Bricks in place of 9-inch brick, the customer gets an additional 2% to 3% carpet area. The savings on account of additional carpet area gained is more than the cost of Bricks. Other Advantages of CLC Bricks: - CLC offers economical POP or putty finish in internal partition walls. Accurate size and shapes help in reducing plastering costs. Better finishing of walls offers good amount of reduction in paints. Eco-friendly Speedier Constructions. Ease of Work ability Universal Acceptability Low Water Absorption.

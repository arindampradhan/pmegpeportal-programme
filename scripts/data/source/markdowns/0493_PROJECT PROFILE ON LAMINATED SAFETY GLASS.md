KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS Introduction : Laminated safety glass has good industrial potential due to its multiple advantages in commercial and industrial applications though the product is not as popular as toughened glass. The main applications of laminated safety glass are:- 1) Automobilies 2) Railways 3) Marine Vessels 4) Aircrafts 5)Defence 6) Household construction 7) Other industrial application. Laminated safety glass is a sandwich made of PVC interlayer or interlayer adhered between two glass sheets. Laminated glass is more resistant to fracture than monolithic glass, but in case of fracture, the PVC interlayer holds the fragments in place. 1 Name of the Product : LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work sheds qin.m stqr.sft 0 Rs.

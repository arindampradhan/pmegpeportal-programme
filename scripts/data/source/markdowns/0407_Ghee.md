Raw Material: The raw material that is used in this manufacturing unit is only milk and packing material. Manufacturing Process: The milk is procured from vendor and stored in storage tanks prior to primary processing of milk, boiler is utilized to generate steam which is utilized in various process of plant which generally includes heating of milk and milk products as and when required. This steam is initially utilized in pasteurizer to heat the milk for pasteurization, after appropriate holding time the milk is sent to another holding tank which stores the milk prior to cooling this is essential to reduce load on milk cooler as well as provide a uniform feed to milk cooler. After cooling of milk its stored within a holding tank from where its supplied to milk homogenizer, which ensures uniform globule size in milk, followed by which milk is stored in a balance tank, from where it’s feed to cream separator which essentially extracts cream from milk which is stored in another balance tank while toned milk is supplied to holding tank of pouch filling machine which packs the toned milk into packets of appropriate quantity which are then stored in IBT prior to dispatch for sale. The cream on the other hand is cooled in another chiller, so as to reduce its temperature to 4 to 5 degree Celsius. The cream is then feed to butter churning machine. The butter churning machine churns out butter from cream which is then feed to a heating vessel which heats the butter in order to obtain the ghee. This ghee is supplied to another pouch packaging machine which packs ghee in appropriate size packs, which are then stored in cold room till they are sent for sale.

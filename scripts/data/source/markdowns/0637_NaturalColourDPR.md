NATURAL COLOURS (PLANT ORIGIN) MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Natural colours are a healthier alternative to artificial colours. Food, beverages, medicines, and cosmetics are all possible uses for natural colors. Natural colours do not impart any flavour to the meal; instead, they serve as a pigment to colour the food in the desired hue. Natural colours, on the other hand, provide additional technical challenges. Food colours, both synthetic and natural, are in high demand. Natural food colouring is in high demand. As a result, we can forecast that there is plenty of room for a new entrepreneur. Orange Red Food Colour comes in a wide spectrum of colours, and their exact uses make them a popular market option. Furthermore, to preserve their high- quality standards, these are manufactured with high-quality materials and modern technology. Fruits like strawberries, oranges, and apples have a longer shelf life since they are fresh and clean without additives. Flavor Emulsions, Sugar-Free Products, Syrups, Food Colors, Liquid Food Colors, Synthetic Flavoring Essence, Flavor Emulsions, Sugar-Free Products These are the most common food colours.

Uses & Market Potential: In 2019, the Indian market for natural food colours is expected to be worth USD 74.09 million. By 2027, it is anticipated to have grown at a CAGR of 3.90 percent across the area, reaching USD 92.96 million. It is linked to the growing population, which is expected to increase the industry, as well as rising consumer awareness about health. People are becoming more aware of the negative health impacts of synthetic food colours, which is boosting demand for natural food colours. Artificial food colours enhance the appeal of food. Brightly coloured meals pique the curiosity of consumers, particularly youngsters. Children who are fed processed food-flavoured eatables are more likely to develop attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These behavioural changes are more common in youngsters who consume higher levels of artificial food colours. Product: NATURAL COLOUR Raw Material: 1. Marigold 2. Rice Flour

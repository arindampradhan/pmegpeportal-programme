DETAILED PROJECT REPORT 1 INTRODUCTION : The overall objective of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is to provide employment opportunities to spinners /weavers/artisans/individuals/ entrepreneurs with remunerative wages through Khadi & V. I. activities. KVIC is implementing Khadi programme through the certified Khadi Institutions of KVIC. At present there are over 2300 Khadi institutions registered under Societies Registration Act, Trust Act, Co-operative Societies Act etc. are implementing Khadi programme throughout the country. In order to extend requisite fillip and to help the sector to emerge as most potent employment provider, KVIC has decided to introduce solar power charkha for production of solar spun yarn through the willing khadi institutions and also entrepreneurs. The yarn produced in this solar powered charkha will be used to convert into cloth using handlooms available with the weavers and wherever possible by introducing new looms to weavers. Looking to the low cost technology, production of yarn through solar charkha activities can easily be undertaken in the rural areas by the Khadi institutions and entrepreneurs. Training for a week on solar charkha will assist the hand spinners to operate the solar charkha at their dwelling place itself. Production Process The project captioned "Production of Solar Charkha cloth" envisages deployment of 25 solar power operated charkhas and 10 looms (5 new and 5 old) to one composite unit. The Khadi institutions already possesses infrastructure for production of Khadi using hand spinning and hand weaving process and arrangement for processing the grey cloth. The raw material supply for the solar charkhas will be ensured through KVIC’s departmental Sliver / Roving plants situated at 6 locations in the country. Beside KVIC’s departmental units the few Khadi institutions also possess the sliver / roving production facilities. They will also cater the need of raw material to the solar power operated charkhas. However, entrepreneurs will have option to procure sliver/roving from textile manufacturing units. The yarn produced out of solar charkhas will be converted into cloth using the weaving implements available with the weavers and subsequent processing for dyeing, finishing etc. The units will utilize the garmenting capacity available in the vicinity to convert the cloth into readymade particularly shirts etc. Market Potential The change of climate has caused major concern about conservation of ecology and nature. Therefore, Government of India is encouraging to use non- conventional energy such as solar energy wherever possible.

|  | The overall objective of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is to
provide employment opportunities to spinners /weavers/artisans/individuals/
entrepreneurs with remunerative wages through Khadi & V.I. activities.
KVIC is implementing Khadi programme through the certified Khadi Institutions of
KVIC. At present there are over 2300 Khadi institutions registered under Societies
Registration Act, Trust Act, Co-operative Societies Act etc. are implementing Khadi
programme throughout the country. In order to extend requisite fillip and to help
the sector to emerge as most potent employment provider, KVIC has decided to
introduce solar power charkha for production of solar spun yarn through the willing
khadi institutions and also entrepreneurs. The yarn produced in this solar powered
charkha will be used to convert into cloth using handlooms available with the
weavers and wherever possible by introducing new looms to weavers.
Looking to the low cost technology, production of yarn through solar charkha
activities can easily be undertaken in the rural areas by the Khadi institutions and
entrepreneurs. Training for a week on solar charkha will assist the hand spinners to
operate the solar charkha at their dwelling place itself.
Production Process
The project captioned "Production of Solar Charkha cloth" envisages deployment of
25 solar power operated charkhas and 10 looms (5 new and 5 old) to one
composite unit. The Khadi institutions already possesses infrastructure for
production of Khadi using hand spinning and hand weaving process and
arrangement for processing the grey cloth.
The raw material supply for the solar charkhas will be ensured through KVIC’s
departmental Sliver / Roving plants situated at 6 locations in the country. Beside
KVIC’s departmental units the few Khadi institutions also possess the sliver / roving
production facilities. They will also cater the need of raw material to the solar
power operated charkhas. However, entrepreneurs will have option to procure
sliver/roving from textile manufacturing units.
The yarn produced out of solar charkhas will be converted into cloth using the
weaving implements available with the weavers and subsequent processing for
dyeing, finishing etc. The units will utilize the garmenting capacity available in the
vicinity to convert the cloth into readymade particularly shirts etc.
Market Potential
The change of climate has caused major concern about conservation of ecology
and nature. Therefore, Government of India is encouraging to use non-
conventional energy such as solar energy wherever possible. The products such as
towels, bed sheets, pillow covers, duster cloth etc. produced using solar yarn will |

be sold to Government departments, Railways etc. with the support of KVIC. Production planning The instant project envisages for introduction of minimum of 25 Nos. solar power operated charkha each having 8 to 10 spindles (per charkha) in each unit with 10 weaving implements and Garment Unit containing 5 single needle locked stitch machine, one overlocking machine and automatic fabric cutting machine with allied accessories. The cost of charkha and minimum cycle of working capital will be provided to the Khadi institutions/entrepreneurs through PMEGP Scheme by Banks. The yarn produced through these solar charkhas will be taken-up for further production of garment especially men shirts by the Khadi institutions. It is estimated that around 60 shirts will be produced each day. Therefore, the annual production of the unit will be around 18000 for 300 days operation and the average price of each shirt comes around Rs.445/-. The unit will also have the option to produce finished products such as bed sheets, towels, pillow covers, duster cloth, uniforms, dungri cloth etc. KVIC through its Marketing Directorate will assist the Khadi institutions for extending support to market their shirts through KVIC Departmental Sales Outlets and also facilitate supply of solar charkha cloth to Government departments, Railways etc. Financial Assistance Financing of Solar charkha units to be set by Khadi Institutions under PMEGP will receive financial assistance as per the provision of PMEGP with Margin money assistance as provided under PMEGP scheme. 2 ABOUT THE PROMOTER : Khadi institutions / Entrepreneurs 3 COST OF PROJECT : A.

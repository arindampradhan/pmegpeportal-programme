KURKURE SNACKS 1. INTRODUCTION Extruded snacks are a type of snack prepared through the extrusion process, in which raw materials such as starch-rich materials such as corn, maize, wheat, rice, potato flour, and so on are ground to the correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour, and then transformed into hot melt fluids or dry mixes. This mixture is passed through a pre- conditioner, where other ingredients, such as liquid sugar, fats, dyes, meats, or water, are added, depending on the target product. To begin the cooking process, steam is pumped, and the preconditioned mix (extrude) is then passed through an extruder, where it is expanded or puffed. Extrusion cooking is the most recent and advanced technology to produce ready-to- eat snacks. Extrusion cooking necessitates a higher temperature and a shorter cooking time. Extrusion cooking is a common processing method in the food industry because it is a cost- effective manufacturing method. Extrusion cooking produces products with low density, high expansion, and a distinctive texture by combining high temperature, high pressure, and high force. Extrusion allows you to change the functional and rheological properties of food ingredients in addition to the normal advantages of heat production.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Snacks give energy during the day or when you exercise. A balanced snack in between meals can help to feel fuller and avoid overeating at mealtime. Snacks are small portions of food consumed between meals. RTE Snacks are available in a number of formats, extruded food, including canned snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items prepared at home with fresh ingredients. Snack foods are usually made to be compact, simple, and filling. As a form of convenience food, processed snack foods are built to be less perishable, more durable, and more compact than prepared foods. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Raw materials Degermed Cornmeal is used either alone or along with carriers like Rice flour, Besan, spices, vegetable oils, etc. are procured from the market or local vendors and stored properly for further processing. Blending All of the ingredients (corn flour, rice flour, salt, etc.) are blended in a fixed proportion and then moistened with water. Water should be uniformly distributed for optimal results. On a wet basis, enough water is applied to raise the moisture content to 14-16 percent. All the ingredients are blended in a Ribbon blender. Extrusion: After proper blending and mixing with water, the raw materials become less viscous or sticky as they pass through the Kneading zone, which is heated by external heaters. This zone may include mixing devices such as pins, slots, and other features that require the product to follow a circuitous route within the extruder to thoroughly mix the ingredients. The superheated water in the material stays liquid due to the high pressure within the extruder. Because of a sudden drop in pressure, dough mass passes through an external Restrictor plate, and shaping dies, and the product expands directly after exiting from dying due to superheated water passing out of the product as steam.

The continuously emerging product is cut into small lengths by rotating knives against the die surface. The speed of rotation of cutting knives will determine the length of the product. Frying For texture and stability, the extruded material is fried to reduce the moisture level from 8-10 percent to 1.5-2 percent. Seasoning This Kurkure seasoning with spices and flavor is a very important process for enhancing the taste of extruded food. Many spicy and pungent ingredients, such as cumin, chilli, and other spices, are used in this seasoning. This seasoning is especially good for Kurkure sticks. Metal detection Metallic contamination of food products during the manufacturing process cannot be completely avoided, even with extreme caution. Consumers can be seriously injured by metal particles that penetrate the product during the manufacturing process or are already present in the raw material. Food metal detectors provide effective protection against both ferrous and non-ferrous metals (aluminium, stainless steel, etc.). They can be used in any phase of the manufacturing process and for a wide range of applications. Packaging The ready Kurkure type snacks are packed in appropriate packages and sealed using filling and packaging machine. 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1000-1200 square feet. 3.2 Plant & Machinery Weighing machine: The weighing machine is used to measure the raw material in order to mix them in a certain ratio.

Seasoning tumbler: A machine that plays a vital role in salting and seasoning large quantities of Kurkure type snacks and other snacks with a gentle, effective tumbling action. Variable speed control and adjustable tilt produce a uniformly covered product with minimal breakage and wastage. Metal detector: A metal detector is a device that detects the presence of metal in the food item before packaging. Packaging machine: A packing machine is also a type of Flow Wrap Machine that packs the Kurkure type snacks inside the pouch and seal the packages automatically.

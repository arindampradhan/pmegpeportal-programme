# 0664 Project Profile On Phosphor Bronze Bushes

## Page 1

KVIC- PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON PHOSPHOR BRONZE BUSHES Introduction : An alloy of copper with other elements like Tin & Phosphours is called phosphor bronzes generally phosphor bronze contains Tin up to 10-12% and Phosphorus up to 0.3% apart from copper & other elements. Addition of Phisohorus improves foundry properties raises hardness, strength elastic properties & specially corrosion resistance and anti friction properties which makes it suitable & making bushes where antifriction properties alongwith strength are required. Phosphor Bronze Bushes have wide applications in engineering marine & automobile industries.

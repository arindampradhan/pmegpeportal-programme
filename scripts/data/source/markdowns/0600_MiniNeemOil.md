MINI NEEM OIL PLANT Introduction Neem oil is a Non-edible oil pressed from the fruits and seeds of the neem (Azadirachta indica), an evergreen tree which is endemic to the Indian subcontinent and has been introduced to many other areas in the tropics. It is the most important of the commercially available products of neem for organic farming and medicines. Qualities of Neem Oil  Neem Oil works as a natural substitute for anti-aging products and as a protective agent against skin damage caused by UV rays.  It deeply penetrates skin to restore moisture, enhance elasticity, smooth wrinkles, stimulate collagen production, and heal cracks caused by dryness.  It reduces skin redness and brings out a healthy glow.  Its ability to unclog pores and follicles while soothing irritated skin without leaving a greasy residue makes Neem Carrier Oil an effective agent for acne-prone skin.  It prevents future breakouts by eliminating acne-causing bacteria, purging impurities, tightening the pores, and evening out skin tone. By softening the skin to make it supple, it facilitates the healing of scars and reduces their look and feel.

the seeds of the tree and has many different traditional uses. Neem is known for its pesticidal and insecticidal properties, but people also use it in hair and dental products. Neem Oil Market Analysis The global neem extracts market demand was 503.5 USD million in 2013 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14.8% from 2014 to 2020. In 2020, the market was growing at a steady rate and with the rising adoption of strategies by key players, the market is expected to rise over the projected horizon. Neem oil market is expected to witness growth on account of rising demand from various end-use industries including personal care, pharmaceutical, animal feed and agriculture. Furthermore, increasing consumer awareness about health benefits of neem, particularly in developed regions, is anticipated to boost the market growth over the forecast period. There is immense scope in the market for neem oils, and the entire host of market players is expected to employ integral strategies in order to attain a greater market share. Usage of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in farming results in decreasing the quality of the produce and has harmful effects on the ecology. This makes neem-based fertilizer (buy product received from neem oil extraction) and pesticide ideal for farming. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for manufacturing of Neem Oil:  Expeller  Cooking kettle  Filter press  Boiler

Other equipment’s:  Electric motor  Oil Decorticator  Cage set, filter cloth etc.  V belts, pipelines etc. Processing Neem oil can be obtained through pressing (crushing) of the seed kernel through cold pressing or through a process incorporating temperature controls between 40°C and 50°C. Hence, it is also called as cold pressed neem oil. Neem seed oil can also be obtained by solvent extraction of the neem seed, fruit, oil, cake or kernel. This solvent-extracted neem oil is of a lower quality as compared to the standard cold pressed neem oil. Neem cake is a by-product obtained in the solvent extraction process for neem oil. Normally neem oil is extracted at 20%-25% of raw material but it gives a buy product known as Neem cake, which also have market value (because of its use in agricultural farming). Land &Building required: Land required 1000 square feet Approximate rent for the same is Rs. 20,000 per month. Machinery & Equipment’s required: Name Cost (Rs.)

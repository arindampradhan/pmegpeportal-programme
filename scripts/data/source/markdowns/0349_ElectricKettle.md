1. INTRODUCTION An electric kettle is an electrical appliance, that has a self-contained heating unit, for heating water, and automatically switches off when the water reaches boiling point or at a preset temperature below 100 °C. It is thus different to the stove top kettle, which is less energy efficient and takes longer to boil the same volume of water as the electric kettle. An electric kettle comes with a heating element inside it, which, heats the liquid inside the kettle within comparatively least time. An electric kettle is one of the simplest household appliances available on the market right now. There are more than a thousand models of electric kettles available on the market today. When you plug in an electric kettle to an outlet, a large amount of electric current passes through the cord and it, in turn, heats the heating element. The element heats because of the resistance offered by the heating element. This resistance converts the electrical energy into heat, which, in turn, heats the liquid inside the kettle. 2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: An Electric Kettle or simply electric tea kettle is a household appliance that is widely used hot water for drinking or cooking. The heating element or the coil at the bottom of the container helps for quick heating. It heats water within a minute than any type of conventional kettle used for making tea. This is perfectly safe in use in the kitchen or in small areas where cooking space is very limited.

The global electric kettle market exhibited moderate growth during recent years. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 5% during the next five years. An electric kettle is a kitchen appliance that assists in boiling water that can be used for the preparation of tea, coffee, soups, and other beverages instantly. It is generally made using materials that help conduct heat efficiently, such as metals. PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL ➢ High Grade Steel ➢ Heat Resistant Plastic (such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), or polystyrene (PS) ➢ Rubber ➢ Copper, Brass and Nickle ➢ On/Off Switches ➢ A connection linking the element to the cord ➢ Plug ➢ Packaging Materials (Such as plastic bags, cartoon boxes, etc.) MANUFACTURING PROCESS

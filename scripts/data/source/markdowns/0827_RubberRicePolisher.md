RUBBER RICE POLISHER Introduction: Rubber Rice Polishers/Rubber Brakes have special application in modern rice mill industries for polishing rice. Rubber polisher improves the efficiency of the rice mills and plays one of the major roles in improving the quality of rice production. It is a perfect choice for rice mills who want to maintain a balance in their input and output ratio. There are various brands of rice rubber rollers available in the market and this is what aids in making the rice production much easy for sale and consumption. Through a good quality rubber polisher, one can easily increase the productivity and the accuracy of the rice grains in the market and target high prices for it. The high-end quality of the rice obtained from the rice rubber polisher plays an important role in deciding the final price of the rice sold in the market. The long grain rice is sold at a better rate than the small ones. These products are needed in large quantities in modern rice mill plant. The modern rice mill concept has greatly helped in recovering by product i.e. rice bran and has helped to be economically sound. All new plants installed to polish the rice which has adopted this method and is increasing at the rate of 5% per year with higher yield of materials. Uses & Market Potential: Rice Rubber Polisher is mainly some rectangular rods that are used to deliver high-end performance and polish

rice grains at a fair price. These polishers give the rice a dazzling and shining appeal and create grains that are long lasting and doesn’t break easily. There are different grades of rice rubber polishers available in the market depending on the one that suits the production and processing types. It will deliver you with high-end results and doesn’t let the breakdown of the grain easily. India is one of the major rice producers and a good number of rice mills are working in different districts and having good demand of rice polisher for the rice mill. Raw Material: The raw materials required for manufacture Rubber Rice Polisher are natural rubber, rosin, Peptiser, antioxidant, activator, stearic acid, titanium dioxide, accelerator, sulphur, HBS, TMTM, process oil, china clay and silica powder. All the above raw materials are available locally from manufacturers or traders. Machinery Requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Description Qty. Amount 1. Rubber mixing mill size 14’’x36’’ complete 1 700000 with 40 HP motor and other accessories 2. Hydraulic Press 1 450000 3. Non IBR Baby Boiler oil fired complete with 1 350000 pump, blower, chimney and other standard accessories 4. Cutting machine 1 100000 5. Die & moulds Ls 250000 6. Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 7. Total Amount 1900000 Manufacturing Process: The process involves compounding of rubber with different chemicals and reinforcing fillers in the mixing mill. After mixing, the materials come in sheet form and are sent to cutting machine to cut into

different sizes. Then the compounded sheet of different sizes are placed in the mould and pressed in the Hydraulic Press with steam heating arrangement. After moulding the materials are finished, checked and packed. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 50 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 11 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

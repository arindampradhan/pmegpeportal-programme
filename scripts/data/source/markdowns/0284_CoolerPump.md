COOLER PUMP MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Cooler pump basically is compact, submersible water pumps are mostly used on air coolers, aquariums, and fountains. By virtue of it’s functions it is also called centrifugal pumps. The centrifugal pump is commonly found inside a submersible fountain pump and desert coolers As the impeller inside it turns, water is drawn in one side of the pump. It is then expelled out the other end. The power and size of the impeller decide the amount of water flow. More water can be pumped if we have a larger impeller. As the impeller rotates, it moves water from the inlet (which is located near the center of rotation of the impeller) along the surfaces of the impeller to the outer portions of the volute by means of centrifugal force (thus, its name centrifugal pump). As this water collects in the outer regions of the volute, it is directed to the outlet. The water leaving the outlet causes the water pressure to drop at the inlet. To match the rate with which water is leaving the outlet, the pump sucks in new water at the inlet. These pumps must be primed before starting, which in this case is already done because of its underwater application.

Uses & Market Potential: Cooling water pumps are used for supplying heat exchangers with cooling water. Their flow rate varies depending on the heat flow to be dissipated. The required head is determined by the type of cooling system. A distinction is made between wet cooling and dry cooling processes. As the construction of residential accommodation, office complex and the standard of living is increasing day by day, demand for this item is also increasing specially in the sections of society who are not able to afford air conditioned. It is understood that during the period of last 10 years there is a rise in demand for the item @ 60 % p.a. and this trend is likely to continue. Desert coolers are economical (both initial and running costs are low) and are effective in hot and dry areas. They are not effective in humid areas. These motors have different ratings. The demand for such motor is increasing day by day. Product: Cooler Pump Raw Material: Raw materials are as follows:  PVC Impeller  Stamping Pair  32SWG Copper wire for stator coil winding  PVS Bobbin pair for coil binding

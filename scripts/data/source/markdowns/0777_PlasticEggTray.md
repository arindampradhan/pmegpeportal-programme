PLASTIC EGG TRAY MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Egg trays are tray-shaped material with a pocket used to hold and protect eggs from damage in the transportation process. Egg trays are designed primarily for the shipment of multiple numbers and varieties of eggs. The primary material used for trays fabrication is dimpled foam, but technology advancement introduces new materials such as plastics into this field. These materials allow the eggs to be easily stored. The primary use of the egg tray is for packaging and storing purposes. The egg trays are made up of plastics, which mainly include polyvinyl chloride polymers (PVC), polypropylene (PP), or sometimes polystyrene (PS). Uses & Market Potential: Egg trays are used to transport, carry, provide protection and keep them separate from each other. Increasing demand for nutritious food, including eggs, due to the rise in health awareness is the primary factor in escalating market growth. Eggs are

a quickly cooked and healthy edible option for many populations. In India, eggs per capita consumption has risen to 68 from 30 eggs per annum. Eggs are considered a few of the primary sources of proteins, vitamins, and minerals and can provide 1/5th of the individual's daily requirement. Due to their multiple health benefits, they are consumed as breakfast in households and restaurants in several countries. The growing production of eggs for the growing consumer (APAC records) demands also leads to egg trays production load. China is a leading giant in the production of eggs worldwide, as it produced more than 300 billion eggs in 2016 along with it the price of packaging products for eggs rose by 1.62 times during 2000-2018. For example, an egg tray cost 7.42$ in 2000. The price of the tray went up to 12.10$ in 2018. Product: Plastic Egg Trays Raw Material: Basic raw materials are:  PVC (polyvinylchloride), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) are few of the main component which can be used for production of product. Generally, PVC is preferred over others due to the easy molding process and low cost. It consists of a vinyl chloride monomer. The resin of PVC looks like a white powdery substance.  Pigments such as organic and inorganic pigments are added in the form of powder.  Fillers such as talc and calcium carbonate in the form of power.

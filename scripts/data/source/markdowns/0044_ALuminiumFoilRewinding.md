ALUMINIUM FOIL REWINDING Introduction Aluminium foil (or aluminium foil in North America), often referred to with the misnomer tin foil, is aluminium prepared in thin metal leaves with a thickness less than 0.2 mm (7.9 mils); thinner gauges down to 6 micrometres (0.24 mils) are also commonly used. In the United States, foils are commonly gauged in thousandths of an inch or mils. Standard household foil is typically 0.016 mm (0.63 mils) thick, and heavy duty household foil is typically 0.024 mm (0.94 mils). The foil is pliable, and can be readily bent or wrapped around objects. Thin foils are fragile and are sometimes laminated to other materials such as plastics or paper to make them more useful. Aluminium foil supplanted tin foil in the mid 20th century. Formulation Aluminium foil is produced by rolling sheet ingots cast from molten billet aluminium, then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has

become too thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner. The continuous casting method is much less energy intensive and has become the preferred process. For thicknesses below 0.025 mm (1 mil), two layers are usually put together for the final pass and afterwards separated which produces foil with one bright side and one matte side. The two sides in contact with each other are matte and the exterior sides become bright; this is done to reduce tearing, increase production rates, control thickness, and get around the need for a smaller diameter roller. Some lubrication is needed during the rolling stages; otherwise, the foil surface can become marked with a herringbone pattern. These lubricants are sprayed on the foil surface before passing through the mill rolls. Kerosene based lubricants are commonly used, although oils approved for food contact must be used for foil intended for food packaging. Aluminium becomes work hardened during the cold rolling process and is annealed for most purposes. The rolls of foil are heated until the degree of softness is reached, which may be up to 340 °C (644 °F) for 12 hours. During this heating, the lubricating oils are burned off, leaving a dry surface. Lubricant oils may not be completely burnt off for hard temper rolls, which can make subsequent coating or printing more difficult. The rolls of aluminium foil are then slit on slitter rewinding machines into smaller rolls. Roll slitting and rewinding is an essential part of the finishing process. Description of Aluminium Foil Rewinding Machine Machinery for Aluminium Foil Rewinding includes the following:  Main Machinery (Automatic/ Normal) This machine is mostly used in the paper making industries & aluminium Foil rewinding process to make different types of roll.

Besides, because of the cutting-edge technology, it also counts the number of roll it produces at a time. An extra remote for handling the device is attached in the machine, so, one can control its speed while operating the machine. Aluminium Foil Rewinding Market Analysis The global aluminium foil market size was valued at USD 23.1 billion in 2018 and is expected to advance at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2019 to 2025. Increasing demand from food and pharmaceutical packaging sectors is expected to significantly drive the market over the coming years. The versatility of aluminium foil makes it an ideal material for use in different forms of packaging. Benefits of the product including malleability, strength, dead fold characteristics, and formability are likely to boost the market growth over the forecast period. In addition, the product’s ability to withstand extreme temperature is likely to fuel its demand as a packaging material. Aluminium Foil Rewinding Manufacturing Process  Load the Jumbo roll on the machine.  Loading of core.  Rewinding  Cutting after rewinding  Taping  Box packing

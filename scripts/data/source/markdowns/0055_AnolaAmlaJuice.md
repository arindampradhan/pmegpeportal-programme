ANOLA(AMLA) JUICE 1. INTRODUCTION Anola (Emblica Officinalis Geartn) is one of India's oldest fruits, and its unique properties have earned it the title of "wonder fruit for health." It is native to India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and China and belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is one of the most important fruits of the Indian subcontinent's tropics and subtropics. The native fruit is extremely adaptable, allowing it to thrive in a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. It goes by a variety of names, including ‘Aonla,' ‘Amalakki,' ‘Nelli,' and ‘Indian gooseberry,' among others. The fruit is a potent antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antibacterial, with antiviral and antacid properties, high content of vitamin C (699 mg ascorbic acid/100 g) in the pulp, as well as other nutrients like polyphenols, pectin, iron, calcium, and phosphorus. It is not popular as a table fruit due to its highly acidic and astringent taste, low total soluble solids (TSS), and poor flavour and colour. The fruit is highly perishable, and it is only available in India for a limited time between October and January. After harvesting, its storage life in atmospheric conditions is only 5–6 days. Appropriate storage and processing methods can reduce post-harvest losses by 30% and extend the shelf life of the fruit. The few postharvest technologies that are available are complex and out of reach for small farmers on a farm level. Consumers are hesitant to eat it raw due to its astringent nature. Efforts are being made to develop value-added products that are both nutritious and popular with consumers. As a result, various value addition technologies are available to reduce aonla fruit postharvest losses. Banarasi, Chakaiya, Francis, NA-4 (Krishna), NA 5 (Kanchan), NA-6, NA- 7, NA-10, and BSR-1 are common high yielding cultivated aonla varieties (Bhavanisagar). IMPORTANCE OF ANOLA Anola fruit contains three times more protein and 160 times more vitamin C (699 mg/100 g) than an apple. Except for the Barbados cherry, it has the richest source of vitamin C of any

fruit. Because of its astringent taste, anola is not popular as a table fruit, but it has a lot of potential for processing and medicinal uses in a variety of products, and there is a lot of demand for anola products on the market. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Alone juice is the natural remedy for several diseases and also boosts the immune as it is a rich source of ascorbic acid. This fruit can help control blood sugar levels, improve digestion, and weight loss. It can also be used as a heartburn treatment. Amla juice is also used to treat a variety of ailments. This nutrient-dense beverage will aid in the elimination of toxins while also supporting liver function. Drinking amla juice daily is equally beneficial in stimulating hair growth. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT  The fresh Anola sound mature fruit are required for this entire product. Fresh Anola which is available only for 3 months in a year.  Kms and water are required for juice making.  Good Packaging material required for the packaging the final product. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS  Harvesting: The change in seed colour from creamy white to brown is indicative of fruit maturity. Fully developed fruits, which show signs of maturity, are harvested. This helps in the size gain of the remaining fruit.  Storage Aonla fruits are highly perishable in nature as it`s storage in atmospheric conditions after harvesting is very limited. Due to its perishable nature, it is difficult to store or transport aonla fruits over long distances. The fruits may be kept in cold storage for 7-8 days at 0- 2°C and 85-90% relative humidity.  Washing Select mature, firm, and fibreless aonla fruits and washed in cold water to remove the impurity dirt and other foreign particles from the fruits, the fruits and vegetable washer machine are used for efficient washing of fruit.

 Deseeding and segmentation Properly washed fruits are then taken to seed separation machine for deseeding and segmentation of fruit. It helps to separate the seed material from the fruit segment.  Pulping Extraction of aonla pulp from aonla fruits is necessary for the processing of aonla juice. The pulp is extracted by the addition of water equal to the weight of segments and passing through the pulping machine. The pulp of aonla is filtered after for further processing.  Pasteurization Now the Fruit Pulp is first pasteurized at 780 C for 15-20 minutes. After pasteurization the fruit juice are taken to cooling section where addition of potassium Meta bi sulphide are added as preservatives.  Filling and storage The juice is then filled in sterilized bottles and after capping the bottle is sterilize for 20 minutes and stored in a cool and dry place 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500-2000 square feet. 3.2Plant & Machinery This manufacturing unit will be semi-automatic type and the plant capacity is set to be 1000 Liter per day.  Fruits and vegetable washing machine Fruit washing machines are used to thoroughly clean fruits and vegetables. It's important of equipment for pre-treating fruits and ensuring the cleanliness of raw materials and finished goods. It can be applied to a variety of fruits, including Aonla, Lime, Lemon, Apples, Oranges, Bananas, Mangoes, Pineapples, Lychees, and Kiwi fruits, among others.  Aonla juice extractor machine: Machine is widely used for extracting the juice from Aonla in an efficient and hygienic manner.

1. INTRODUCTION Heat pipes are heat transfer devices that combines the principles of both thermal conductivity and phase transition to effectively transfer heat between two solid interfaces. They are hollow cylindrical pipes filled with a small amount of fluid that evaporates to produce heat. This heat is then rejected from another end for its application on industrial processes. For example, it is used in Air Conditioning and Refrigeration application. Every heat pipe has three components; ➢ Working Fluid - Which transfers heat by Evaporation and Condensation. ➢ Envelope - Which provides a leak-tight pressure vessel to contain the working fluid. ➢ Wick -To return liquid from the Condenser to the Evaporator using capillary forces. HOW HEAT PIPES WORKS The heat input vaporizes the liquid working fluid inside the wick in the evaporator section. The saturated vapor, carrying the latent heat of vaporization, flows towards the colder condenser section. In the condenser, the vapor condenses and gives up its latent heat. The condensed liquid returns to the evaporator through the wick structure by capillary action. The phase change processes and two-phase flow circulation continue as long as the temperature gradient between the evaporator and condenser are maintained.

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Heat Pipes have been widely employed in various applications throughout industry. Some applications of heat pipes are listed below: ➢ Aerospace: They enjoy the distinct advantages of low weight, essentially zero maintenance, and superior reliability over other devices, therefore heat pipes enjoy wide application in the area of spacecraft cooling and temperature stabilization. ➢ Heat Exchangers: Because of flexibility in design, heat pipes can easily be utilized as heat exchangers inside sorption and vapor-compression heat pumps, refrigerators, and other types of heat transfer devices. ➢ Electronic Components: As of the present, one of the largest applications of heat pipe technology is the cooling of electronic components such as central processing units (CPUs), circuit boards, and transistors. ➢ Transportation System: Several heat pipe applications are used to improve the safety and reliability of air, surface, and rail transportation systems. The heat pipes market size is expected to grow by USD 637.35 mn and record a CAGR of 4% during 2020-2024. There has been a rise in the deployment of HVAC systems in domestic, commercial and industrial buildings which has increased the demand for heat pipes significantly. HVAC consumes about half of the total electricity used in commercial buildings which indirectly bolsters the market. Growth in the HVAC industry is anticipated to boost the growth of the market. In addition, rise in exports of electronic goods from APAC and increase in use of heat pipes in meat and poultry processing is anticipated to boost the growth of the market as well. PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL ➢ Copper ➢ Sintered metal powder ➢ Angle grinder, Wire Brushes, etc. ➢ Packaging Material (Such as Plastic Sheets, Carton Boxes, Tape, etc.)

MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Raw material procurement 2. Preparing a pipe and a wick structure 3. Placing the wick structure in the pipe, vacuuming the pipe, and filling a working fluid in the pipe. 4. Heat Treatment 5. Sealing 6. Packaging 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1200 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.25,000 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery

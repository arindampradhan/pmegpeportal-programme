TECHNICAL ASPECTS : The most important process in the manufacturing of mirror is silvering on glass. The fio. llowing various operation are involved in the process of manufacturing of mirrors : ii. Selection of glass sheet. iii. Cleaning. iv. Sensitizing. v. Silvering. vi. Coppering Painting. Plate glass and sheet glass are cleaned by chemical process or by surface polishing to clean the surface contamination so as to give proper adherence. They are given further treatment known as sensitizing makes the surface active for attracting the silver metal to form a quick adherence and uniform coating of film. Then the plate and sheet glasses are silvered either by spraying process or by pouring method. Then they are given copper coating to protective coating by paining either with red lead and varnish or cellulose enamel twin. Quality Specification The following specification have been formatted and published by the Bureau of Indian Standards for guidance in maintenance of the quality of the product : st IS:3438-1977 - Silvered glass mirror for general purpose (1 revision) IS:6184-1971- Specification for furniture mirror (Re- affirmed 1987) Production Quantity (Annual) a.

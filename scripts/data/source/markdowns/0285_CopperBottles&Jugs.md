COPPER BOTTLES & JUGS MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Copper bottles and jugs are containers made of copper used to store and drink water. They can come in different shapes and have different purposes. The reason that copper is still used in the crafting of vessels is due to copper’s durability and ability to sterilize whatever it touches by killing bacteria and other pathogens. Copper bottles and jugs are mainly used for drinking water, as they can sterilize it, alkalize it, and release beneficial copper ions into it. When used for storing acidic drinks (such as cocktails), these copper vessels can be lined with a non-reactive metal to prevent the formation of toxic copper salts. Copper is known to be oligodynamic (the sanitizing impact of metals on microorganisms) and can obliterate microscopic organisms adequately. It is particularly powerful against several microscopic organisms that cause extreme diseases in the human body. Copper washes down and detox stomach to guarantee legitimate disposal of waste and hurtful items. It likewise manages liver and kidney working, and guarantees the retention of supplements from sustenance. Copper advances the breakdown and disposal of fat cells. At the point when water is put in a copper vessel, the copper delicately drains into the water and gives all its positive properties.

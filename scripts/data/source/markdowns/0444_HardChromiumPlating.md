HARD CHROMIUM PLATING Introduction: Hard chromium plating finds extensive application in the engineering industry due to the extreme hardness of the coating, its resistance to heat, wear, corrosion, erosion or friction. The extreme hardness, excellent wear resistance and low co-efficient of friction of chromium deposits are used to advantage on cutting tools, gauges, dies, moulds piston rods, rollers, textile machinery parts, etc. and in many other industrial applications. Hard chromium deposition is somewhat different from that involved in decorative plating and the thickness and hardness of the coating applied is considerably greater. Uses & Market Potential: Hard chromium deposits are generally applied directly to the base metal except in applications like building up badly worn- out or undersized parts and where highly corrosive conditions in service are involved. In such applications, an undercoating is nickel is given and for reclamation work, heavy thickness or nickel is often applied and after machining the article is finished with a thin coating of hard chromium. The nickel layer provides substantial corrosion protection to the base metal, however, the chromium deposits should be at least 13 microns (0.0005 in)

thick for providing requisite wear resistance. Hard chromium deposits are also used for the building up of undersized and worn parts. The value of production is electroplating industries in the MSE sector in the country is 100 crore per annum contributing 0.12% of total production SI sector. It would be rather difficult to accurately estimate the overall market size for hard chromium process in the absence of data base, however, it can be slated that this industrial process on account of its extensive application in engineering industries has an excellent scope at places of concentration of such industries. Units with modern facilities for hard chromium plating on job basis can be set up to meet the requirement of industries with stringent quality standards of engineering applications. Hence, there is wide scope for selling up the products of new unit in this line of manufacturer to meet the requirement. Raw Material: Major raw material requirements are as follows: 1. Hard Chrome Salt 2. Chromic Acid 3. Other chemicals & consumables Machinery & Equipments: Major machineries & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Oil cooled silicon rectifier with stepless Control, 1 250000 output current rating 1000A,output voltage 12V complete with mater panel etc. 2. Resistant board 500A-12V 2 30000 3. Hard chromium planting tank 3 mm M.s/3mm 1 100000 L. L7x3x3 ft. with ducts and bowler for fume extraction 4. Etching tank 3mm ms/3 mm L. L 6x3 ft. with Lip 1 100000 duct and bowler arrangement

Water swill tank 3mm ms/5mm R. L. 5x2x3 ft 1 70000 10. Other machines & equipments Ls 150000 Total Amount 900000 Manufacturing Process: The steel part to be hard chromed are pre- cleaned in a suitable hot alkaline soak cleaner and rinsed well. To obtain a good adhesion of the deposits, anodic etching in simple chromic sulphuric bath for 1-2 minutes is carried out in a separate tank normally. After the etching, the parts are transferred to plating bath. After plating the parts are immersed in drag-out tank rinsed followed by the another water rinsed and hot water rinsed. In case of hardened steel, components are heated to 200° C or above to eliminate hydrogen embitterment. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain

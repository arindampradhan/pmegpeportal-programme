PROJECT REPORT ON BATTERY WATER INTRODUCTION Water used in Batteries (mainly vehicles) should be free from salts, Chlorine and Iron. These impurities spoil the electrodes and reduces the battery and hence special water with minimum impurities are required for the purpose, known as Battery water. Now a days D. M. Water is being used in the Batteries. Raw water from Open well/Bore well or Corporation can be used for the purpose. The demand for distilled water required for battery charging is of considerable value. Preparation of distilled water for battery charging seems to be one of the most prospective venture in small cities. MARKET POTENTIAL This unit can cover about 30 km radius in semi-urban area which has around 2000 four wheelers and it can also cater to the need of small laboratories. Considering the above consumers, the capacity is fixed at 6.0 lakh litres per year BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: The approximate estimate for setting up of unit to produce 6.0 lakh litres distilled water per year. The unit will work for 8 hours per day with 300 working days in a Year. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE:

The unit can be set up in 6 months TECHNICAL ASPECT:- Batter water is manufactured by an exchange process which has two vertical cylinders made of FRP/Plastic fitted with stand and water quality testing kit, so as to ensure continues quality check of water being produced. This cylindrical vessel contains Resin, which has power to remove all hardness from water . Water passes from bottom of the first cylinder and comes from the top and again goes into the bottom of second cylinder, which again comes out from top of the second column in purest form, free from all salts. In this process water has to pass only through two cylinders and many times, gravity force is only sufficient for the purpose. If sufficient pressure is not there one may use small pump for water feeding. Demineralization is the process of removing mineral salts from Water by using the ion exchange process. Demineralised Water is Water completely free ( or almost ) of dissolved minerals Demineralized Water also known as Deionized Water, Water that has had its mineral ions removed. Mineral ions such as cations of sodium, calcium, iron, copper, etc and anions such as chloride, sulphate, nitrate, etc are common ions present in Water. Deionization is a physical process which uses specially-manufactured ion exchange resins which provides ion exchange site for the replacement of the mineral salts in Water with Water forming H+ and OH- ions. Because the majority of Water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces a high purity Water that is generally similar to distilled Water, and this process is quick and without scale buildup. De-mineralization technology is the proven process for treatment of Water. A DM Water System produces mineral free Water by operating on the principles of ion exchange, Degasification, and polishing. Demineralized Water System finds wide application in the field of steam, power, process, and cooling. Raw Water is passed via two small polystyrene bead filled (ion exchange resins) beds. While the cations get exchanged with hydrogen ions in first bed, the anions are exchanged with hydroxyl ions, in the second one. Quality Specification IS: 1069-1964 specification FINANCIAL ASPECTS:

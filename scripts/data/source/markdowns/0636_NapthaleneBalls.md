PROJECT REPORT ON NAPTHALENE BALLS Introduction: Naphthalene balls are used as a moth repellant. Now para-discloro benzene in cubcake form is also used for the purpose. The scheme aims at utilizing crude Naphthalene available from coke oven batteries of steel plants. However, availability of raw materials must be ensured before setting up the unit. Naphthalene Balls are used to prevent the attack of insects. They are extensively used as a household preservative of woolen clothes and as a deodorant tablet for the toilets, urinals, bathrooms, etc. These are manufactured from naphthalene flakes by a tablet making machine having its ball shape die. This industry requires a little machinery and technical know-how. Naphthalene ball manufacturing can profitably be started on a small scale basis. Market Potential: The demand of Naphthalene balls is increasing gradually with the increase of population and urbanization and improving living conditions. In view of this there seems good scope of the product. Production process: The crude Naphthalene is available either in the from of solid

mass or liquid. The latter contains 40 to 60 per cent Naphthalene. The crude Naphthalene is put into kettle and meted by steam or suitable heating arrangements and then treated with sulphuric acid. The acid treated Naphthalene is then neutralized with caustic soda and washed several times with water in hot condition. After treatment with caustic soda, Naphthalene is purified by steam distillation or sub- limitation process. The powered Naphthalene is covered to balls. Process flow: Treatment Crude Mixing with Heating Process with Custic Naphthalene/ Sulphuric acid soda Solid Mass Distillation Washing Ready to sell Packing Finishe process Process d Production Target: Assuming that the Unit will operate for Single Shift of 8 hours per day for 300 working days the annual installed capacity is estimated 150 M. T Naphthalene Balls Raw Materials: The principal raw material of the Unit is crude naphthalene, Custic soda, Suphuric acid, and packing materials, which is available from oil refineries and other suppliers. Naphthalene Balls Making Machine The main required machine is naphthalene balls making machine. Two types of machines options are there. You can go for either manual operated or power operated. However, you can produce more uniformed and quality finished product from a power operated machine. Apart from this, you will also need to have MS jacketed vessels, heating arrangements, storage tanks, weighing scale and pouch sealing machine. The list of machinery includes:  Steam jacketed M. S. Kettle  Steam distillation kettle  Sulphuric acid storage tanks  Delivery pump  Edge runner  Tablet making machine rotary type,  Miscellaneous tools and equipment.

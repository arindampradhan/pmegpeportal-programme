PROJECT REPORT ON ‘SOYA FLOUR’ Product and its applications Lifestyle is changing in most of the urban cities very rapidly. Urban population is health conscious and adopting healthy food habits. There is a lot of stress on avoiding junk food and adopting protein rich food. Soya beans are a rich source of protein and are extensively used in many food items. Soya beans are cultivated in most of the states, Madhya Pradesh being the leader. States like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh Soya bean has good market particularly in value added forms. Bulk of the production is used for extraction of oil. Other products such as soya milk, flour, curd, paneer etc are also popularly consumed as Soya beans are high in protein, low in fat and easy to digest. Gujarat has joined the cultivation but Madhya Pradesh is the highest producer of Soya Beans. With both the husband and wife working the eating and cooking habits are undergoing changeover. Couples do not find time to cook fresh vegetables and resort to using pre cooked or sometimes high protein soya nuggets which do not call for lengthy cooking and have high nutritional value. These soya products are made out of soya flour. Soya flour is highly nutritious food ingredient that has been used for many years. An addition of Soya flour increases its protein content and serves as a source of energy and nutrition. This value addition to the wheat flour does not affect its shelf life and economics. The technology for such products is available with CFTRI. Compliance with PFA Act for such a unit is essential.

Industry Profile and Market Assessment Although soya flour has nutritional benefits, it is primarily used for its functional benefits. The potential market for soya flour are in school feeding programme, social welfare feeding programme, confectionery industry baking industries for nuggets and chunks manufacturing, as a supplement for whear flour. When incorporated into bread dough, it enables bread to retain more moisture during baking process, thereby increasing yield. Thus it is a money maker for the baker. It also extends shelf life of the product by decreasing the rate of staling. When used in dough nuts, soya flour absorbs less oil, which is a relatively expensive ingredient thus saving the cost. Bakery is an age old industry. Bread and biscuits in different varieties manufactured either large multinationals or at village level in small setup form the bakery products. The products are popular both at rural as well as urban level only the product and price differs. While the rural population prefers the cheap homemade variety the urban elite go in for costly varieties in different taste and assortments. There is market for both the varieties. The biscuits in general sense mean a product with lot of calories and which is generally consumed as a snack at tea time or children consume it in between meals. There are variations in the taste and for those who wish to retain energy. Soya flour is an important ingredient of biscuit industry. Soya flour is added to biscuit dough to increase the protein content and provide extra energy. Biscuits are consumed by all irrespective of age or income groups. Manufacturing Process & Know How The process of manufacturing is simple and standardized, it is known as immersion cooking process. Soya beans are washed and thoroughly cleaned to remove dirt and other extraneous matter. These cleaned beans are then packed in clean cloth sacks. These sacks are then soaked in water for around 8-10 hours. Due to soaking the beans swell to nearly double their original size and gain weight by around 2.5 times. The soaked beans are then immersed in boiling water for rapid cooking. The cooked beans are then strained and then spread on trays in a current of mild circulation of air till the moisture content comes down to 10%. The dried soya beans are then cracked in a mill and hulls are separated. The de-hulled beans are ground to desired mesh size and packed. The process loss is approximately 5%. Know how is available with Central Government research Laboratories. The machinery is all indigenously available. The production capacity envisaged is 1 tonnes per day on two shift basis for 250 days per year. The seasonal capacity is 238 tonnes per year.

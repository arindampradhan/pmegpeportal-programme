LED BULB Introduction An LED lamp or LED light bulb is an electric light for use in light fixtures that produces light using one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LED lamps have a lifespan many times longer than equivalent incandescent lamps, and are significantly more efficient than most fluorescent lamps, with some LED chips able to emit up to 303 lumens per watt (as claimed by Cree and some other LED manufacturers). However, LED lamps require an electronic LED driver circuit when operated from mains power lines, and losses from this circuit mean the efficiency of the lamp is lower than the efficiency of the LED chips it uses. The most efficient commercially available LED lamps have efficiencies of 200 lumens per watt (Lm/W). Similar to incandescent lamps (and unlike most fluorescent lamps), LEDs come to full brightness immediately with no warm-up delay. Frequent switching on and off does not reduce life expectancy as with fluorescent lighting. Light output decreases gradually over the lifetime of the LED (see Efficiency droop section). Some LED lamps are made to be a directly compatible drop-in replacement for incandescent or fluorescent lamps. LED lamp packaging may show the light output in lumens, the power consumption in watts, the colour temperature in Kelvin or a colour description such as "warm white", "cool white" or "daylight", the operating temperature range, and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp delivering the same output in lumens. Flow of Current LEDs run on direct current (DC), whereas mains current is alternating current (AC) and usually at much higher voltage than the LED can accept. LED lamps can contain a circuit for converting the mains AC into DC at the correct voltage. These circuits contain rectifiers, capacitors, and may have other active electronic components, which may also permit the lamp to be dimmed. In an LED filament lamp, the driving circuit is simplified because many LED junctions in series have approximately the same operating voltage as the AC supply.

Application of LED Bulb LED Bulb are used for both general and special-purpose lighting. Where coloured light is needed, LEDs that inherently emit light of a single colour require no energy-absorbing filters. White-light LED bulb have longer life expectancy and higher efficiency (more light for the same electricity) than most other lighting when used at the proper temperature. LED sources are compact, which gives flexibility in designing lighting fixtures and good control over the distribution of light with small reflectors or lenses. Because of the small size of LEDs, control of the sp atial distribution of illumination is extremely flexible, and the light output and spatial distribution of an LED array can be controlled with no efficiency loss. LEDs using the colour-mixing principle can emit a wide range of colours by changing the proportions of light generated in each primary colour. This allows full colour mixing in lamps with LEDs of differ. Energy conservation With the growing energy needs and shortage coupled with rising energy cost, a greater thrust in energy efficiency in industrial sector has been given by Govt. of India since 1980s. The energy Conservation Act 2001 has been enacted on 18th August 2001which provides for efficient use of energy its conservation and capacity building of Bureau of Energy Efficiency created under the act. The following steps may be help for conservation of Electrical Energy: i) Adoption of energy conserving technology, production aids and testing facilities. ii) Efficient management of process/manufacturing machineries and systems, QC and testing equipment’s for yielding maximum energy conservation. iii) Optimum use of electrical energy for heating during soldering process can be obtained by using efficient temperature controlled soldering and DE soldering stations. iv) Periodical maintenance of motors compressors etc. v) Use of power factor correction capacitors, proper selection and layout of lighting systems timely switching on/off of the lights, use of Compact Fluorescent Lamps wherever possible.

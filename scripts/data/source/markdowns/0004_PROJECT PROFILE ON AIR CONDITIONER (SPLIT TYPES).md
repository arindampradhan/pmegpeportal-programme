# 0004 Project Profile On Air Conditioner (Split Types)

## Page 1

"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" Project Profile on Air Conditioner (Split Types) Introduction : Air- conditioner performs cleaning, circulating, temperature controlling humidity controlling of air functins within a specified area. Thought window type air-conditioners are being mostly used, the time has come when split type air-conditioners are also in demand. The basic difference between window type and split type air-conditioners is that window tyep AC is a compact unit which is installed near the space to be air-conditioned, whereas split type of A/c is installed in two parts, one in evaporative unit which is installed near the spaces to be air conditioned and second one is condensing unit which is installed away from the spaces to be air-conditioned. In this way, noise of compressor, flow of exhaust (generally hot) air are distanced from the places to be air-conditioned. Split type A/C are bing used in show rooms and other installations where space availabel is less and disturbance to occupants and passers-by is to be avoided. Processof Manufacture:Procuringofvariouscomponentslikecondnsercoil,copperpipe,compressor,cabinet,frame,grills,switchesetc Testing components : Assembly Chargind of gas and Final teting . Market potential In present times, not onlyhuman beings but machines, computers, processes also require conditioned air for proper functioning. CNCs machines, testing labs, calibration centers and even in farming sector demand of AC has emerged.

Split ACs are being installed in offices, showrooms, houses etc. Large companies like Shriram, Carrier, Aircon, Llyods, Jainsons, Videocon, Samsung etc. are doing very good business in ACs up to the capacity of two tonrating.

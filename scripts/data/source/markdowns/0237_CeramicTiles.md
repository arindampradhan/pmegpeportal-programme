1. INTRODUCTION Ceramic tile is the form of flooring that can be used in any room in the building. Kitchens and toilets, as well as foyers, mudrooms, and other high- traffic locations, are the most popular places to find it. However, many homes, especially in warm climates, use tile in living rooms and bedrooms to get great effect. To put it another way, you can't go wrong with tile. If this long-lasting, luxurious flooring has some flaws, it's because it can be rough and cold to walk on, and it's a little difficult to mount for DIYers. The smooth, solid surface of ceramic tiles does not absorb or retain soil, dust, pollen, or other allergens. If tiny objects fall on a ceramic tile, they stick out against the wall, making them easy to clean away with a mop or sponge. This helps to keep the air safe and free of irritants that can affect asthma and allergy sufferers. Ceramic manufacturers can now create products that can be printed or embossed in a variety of forms, thanks to modern processing techniques. Solid tiles may be used in patterns or embellished with personalised designs or motifs. They can also be printed to look like a variety of hardwoods and natural stones. However, the tiles can be made into triangles, rectangles, and planks by cutting and shaping them. Ceramic tile flooring is ideal for any home style, but it is a must-have in any Mediterranean or Southwest-style house. Since ceramic is incredibly rough, it is simple to clean and preserve. Hard ceramics, unlike durable floors, cannot be softened with padding underlayment. If the floor is well- maintained, a good installation will last for hundreds of years. If a single tile fractures as a result of a significant effect, repairing it is a relatively easy operation. There are actually hundreds of different ceramic tile brands to choose from, but just a few suppliers. This is due to the fact that particular manufacturers often sell several brands; they can establish exclusive brands for specific retail chains while still selling their own general brands.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Ceramics tiles have significant uses in almost all commercial and residential building as:  A cover roofs  A floors cover  A cover walls  As tabletops etc. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The raw materials used to form tile consist of clay minerals obtain from mining, silica sand, Talc. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Ceramics are typically produced by the application of heat upon processed clays and other natural raw materials to form a rigid product. To control purity, particle size, particle size distribution, and heterogeneity, ceramic products that use naturally occurring rocks and minerals as a starting material must go through special processing. These characteristics have a significant impact on the finished ceramic's properties. Chemically prepared powders also are used as starting materials for some ceramic products. The chemical composition and particle size of powders made from these synthetic materials can be precisely controlled. The ceramic particles are then shaped into the desired shape. The addition of water and/or additives such as binders, followed by a shape-forming process, accomplishes this. Extrusion, slip casting, pressing, tape casting, and injection moulding are some of the most common ceramic forming methods. The most common processes for ceramic tile are given below  Raw material procurement and storage Once raw material is procured and stored properly, a number of steps take place to obtain the finished product. These steps include batching, mixing and grinding, spray-drying, compacting, drying, glazing, and sintering. Many of these steps are accomplished using automated equipment.  Batch mixing The amount and type of raw materials determine the body composition of many ceramic

products, including tile. The colour of the tile body is also determined by the raw materials, which can be red or white depending on the amount of iron-containing raw materials used. As a result, it's critical to combine the right ingredients in the right proportions to achieve the desired results. Batch calculations are thus required, which must take into account both the raw materials' physical properties and chemical compositions. The raw materials must be mixed together after the appropriate weight of each raw material has been determined. Once the ingredients are weighed, they are added together into a ribbon mixer to mix ingredients properly prior to grinding.  Grinding and slurry formation This step further grinds the ingredients, resulting in a finer particle size that improves the subsequent forming process It is sometimes necessary to add water to a multiple-ingredient batch to improve mixing and achieve fine grinding. Wet milling is the term for this procedure, which is commonly carried out in a Bead mill. A slurry or slip is the resultant water-filled mixture. Filter pressing (which removes 40-50 percent of the moisture) and dry milling is used to remove the water from the slurry.  Spray drying The excess water is usually removed via spray drying if wet milling is used first. The slurry is pumped to an atomizer, which consists of a rapidly rotating disc or nozzle. The slip is dried asit is heated by a rising hot air column, resulting in small, free-flowing granules and a powder suitable for forming. Dry grinding and granulation can also be used to create tile bodies. Granulation is a process in which a mixture of previously dry-ground material is combined with water to form granules, which are then ground into a powder ready for forming.  Compacting Most tiles are formed by dry pressing. In this method, the free-flowing powder, this contains a binder or a low percentage of moisture, flows from a hopper into the forming die. Steel plungers compress the material in a steel cavity, which is then ejected by the bottom plunger with operating pressures of up to 2,500 tonnes. Several other methods are also used where the tile body is in a wetter, more mouldable form. Extrusion plus punching is used to produce irregularly shaped tile and thinner tile faster and more economically. This involves compacting a plastic mass in a high-pressure cylinder and forcing the material to flow out of the cylinder into short slugs. These slugs are then punched into one or more tiles using hydraulic or pneumatic punching presses.

 Drying After forming, ceramic tile must usually be dried (at a high relative humidity), especially if a wet method is used. Drying removes the water at a slow enough rate to prevent shrinkage cracks, which can take several days. Continuous or tunnel driers, heated by gas or oil, infrared lamps, or microwave energy, are used.  Glazing To prepare the glaze, similar methods are used as for the tile body. The glaze is fed through a rotating disc that flings or throws the glaze onto the tile in glazing machine. A stream of glaze falls onto the tile as it passes on a conveyor underneath in the bell/waterfall method. The glaze is sometimes simply sprayed on. Screen printing on, under, or between wet glazed tiles is used for multiple glaze applications. The glaze is fed through a rotating disc that flings or throws the glaze onto the tile in centrifugal glazing or disking. A stream of glaze falls onto the tile as it passes on a conveyor underneath in the bell/waterfall method. The glaze is sometimes simply sprayed on. Screen printing on, under, or between wet glazed tiles is used for multiple glaze applications.  Sintering The tile must be intensely heated after glazing to strengthen it and give it the desired porosity. For firing tile generally, kilns are used. With temperatures around 1,300 degrees Celsius, tunnel kiln firing can take two to three days. The tile is ready to be packaged and shipped after it has been fired and tested. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 6000 Square feet. The rent for the Land can be expected between Rs. 40000 to Rs. 50000. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project.

 Compacting press: Compacting presses are used to create ceramic tiles. Depending on the material being pressed, the presses can also be operated in a hot or cold environment.  Hot air dryer A hot air dryer works very simply. It consists of a heater blower unit Ambient air is drawn through a filter into a heater/blower unit and heated. The temperature can be adjusted up to 1500C.

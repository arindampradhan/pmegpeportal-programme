KVIC - PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON DOMESTIC ELECTRONIC TIMER Introduction : In day to day life it has become necessary to have automatic domestic device to reduce labour and wastages. In this aspect the electronic domestic timer can play a vital role in the house holds for switching off the house hold appliances at predetermines time and duration by the house wives. The unit consists of (1) a timing ciruit formed by resisters and capacitors, (2) IC 555 to perform triggerig function determined by the resistor capacitor constant, (3) driving stag (formed by a transsistor) and a piezo buzzer housed in a cabinet. in the front panel calibrated time - sale will be there to select required time settings. The complete circuit works generally on 1.5 V Battery. The time could also be built in a particulr appliance by using a driving stage & solenoid/ reply to switch off the appliance etc. 1 Name of the Product : DOMESTIC ELECTRONIC TIMER Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft RENTED 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 30,000.00 10MHZ Osilloscipe, Multimeters, Stop watch (Mechanical type) DC Power Supply (low cost), Hand Tools/Jigs/Fixtures, Office Equipment & Furniture & Work Table etc. Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 30,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 130,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 160,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in 000) Sr. No. Particulars Capacity in No./Q.

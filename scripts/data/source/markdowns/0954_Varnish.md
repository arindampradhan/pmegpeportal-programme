VARNISH Introduction: Varnish is a solution of resin or resinous substances (such as common resin, amber, copal, shellac etc) in alcohol, turpentine or oil. It enhances and gives warmth to the grain of the wood and is resistant to impact, heat, abrasion, water, and alcohol. It can be used as a topcoat over worn finishes. Varnishing is done to intensify or brighten the appearance of natural grains in wood. Varnish is a clear transparent hard protective finish or film. It is neither a paint nor stain. In its native state it has little or no color, but may be pigmented as desired, and is sold commercially in various shades. The term "varnish" refers to the finished appearance of the product. It is not a term for any single or specific chemical composition or formula. Characteristic of good varnish:  It should dry rapidly  It should form a hard film on drying.  It should not crack on drying. It should have sufficient elasticity.  It should be durable and weather resistant.

PROJECT REPORT ON BAMBOO STICKS PRODUCTION UNIT FOR INCENSE STICKS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Agarbatti/Incence Sticks production is a well-established cottage industry and is a 5 crore worth growing market in India. Base material for incense sticks is bamboo stick which accounts for one third of its weight. Cost of bamboo is only about one percent of the final finished product but is the most essential raw material for agarbatti production. However due to shortage of gregarious flowering of the major species of bamboo used in stick production i.e. Muli bamboo, there can be shortage of raw material and decrease in supply of sticks. Further, due to decrease in import duty from 30% to 10% on bamboo sticks, 70% of bamboo needs of agarbatti industry are fulfilled by imported bamboo sticks from China and Vietnam. The imported bamboo sticks are better with respect to uniformity of dimensions and quality because of large scale mechanization. Bamboo Mission is focusing on development of bamboo sector through encouraging bamboo plantations and introducing mechanization . Now, with focus of Govt. on this sector the Industry move to mechanized stick production process as a full-fledged business activity. 2

INTRODUCTION In India, the burning of incense in religious and social functions across all communities is being practiced since early times. Agarbatti which was once a staple feature of Indian devotional activities has now branched out as products associated with aromatherapy, meditation and yoga. Agarbatti sector of India is largest in the world. Agarbatti production is a well-established cottage industry and is a 5 crores worth growing market in India. Though India is second in bamboo production, a large part of agarbatti industry is importing 70% of its bamboo needs Despite availability of a large number of species of bamboo, the most commonly used species for stick production are M. Baccifera (Muli), Bambusa vulgaris (Bari), Bambusa tulda (Mritinga), Bambusa balcooa (Barak) and Dendrocalamus longispathus (Rupai) . As compared to manual sticks produced in India, the imported bamboo sticks on the whole are better with respect to uniformity of dimensions and quality THE PROJECT Stick making process in India is moving towards mechanization. However, countries like China and Vietnam are producing mechanized sticks. The present project is for establishment of round bamboo sticks production unit for agarbattis by using mechanized process. Agarbatti industry uses two kinds of bamboo sticks- square and round. By manual process only square sticks are produced. However, with rising exports, demand for round bamboo sticks has risen. The length of sticks vary from 8 to 10 inches, however majority of incense sticks (70 to 80%) is 8 inches (20.32cm). The units shall procure bamboo sticks from the collectors who collect the bamboos from the forest as well as from growers of bamboo plantations and produce round sticks of 8”to 9” by mechanized process as demanded by the Indian agarbatti sector using high processing technology. High processing technology will maximize utilization of bamboo material and produce quality output. This will help the entrepreneur to compete with the sticks imported from China and Vietnam. Still wastage of bamboo (nodes, green strips, fibers etc.) is estimated to be 40%. These wastes can be used as fuel for drying unit of bamboo sticks. Selling the waste to bamboo charcoal unit shall also be explored for effective waste management. 3

STRATEGIES: Following strategies shall be followed for implementation of the project: 1. Proper monitoring of quality at each stage from procurement of raw material to packaging of finished product by applying proper supervision and quality checks. 2. Procurement of latest machinery for mechanizing the entire process. 3. Market surveys for production of stick as per market trend at competitive price. 4. Branding of the bamboo sticks. 5. Tie-ups with e-commerce websites and logistic partners. 6. Coordination with various Govt. agencies for Training and support. 7. Participation in trade fairs FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT: Technical Analysis: The location of the Unit near the raw material site is an advantage as the raw material is available in abundance. Secondly, well connected districts with roads will aid in transportation/ distribution of finished goods to be easy as well as cheap. Labour is easily available at a cheaper cost. The labours are involved in manual stick making as a part-time activity therefore transition to mechanized stick making won’t be a difficulty as they already know the basic flow of the process. As per the requirement of agarbatti industry the project aims to produce 8” and 9” round bamboo sticks by following a mechanized process. The process of making bamboo sticks by mechanized process involves the following steps: 4

Latest machines with desired parameters will be imported from suppliers of China or Vietnam. List of required machines along with estimated price is given at Annexure I. Generally, these bamboo sticks will be packed in bundles of one kg. However the packaging can be modified as per precise demand and requirement of the buyers. Heavy rainfall occurs from July to September and as the bamboos regenerate during this period therefore the production activity will only be for 9 months in a year. Capacity utilization of the unit can be 80% for the first 5 years.  Commercial Feasibility: Only raw material for production of bamboo sticks is bamboo pole which is available in abundance. With policy initiatives focusing on bamboo plantations, availability of raw material can be assured.  Market Analysis: There is a huge requirement of bamboo sticks from India agarbatti market and quality bamboo sticks sell like a hot cake. India accounts for over 70% consumption of the world incense stick market. Indian agarbatti market amounts to Rs.6000 crore out of which Rs.2000 crore is in organized market.  The incense stick makers range from small fragmented units to small factories to FMCG giants. Between FY2012 and FY2016, India exported agarbattis worth $498.02 million. In addition, annual exports witnessed an 11.57% growth during the same period, from $89.64 million in FY2012 to $100.02 million in FY2016. 6

VACCUM CLEANER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A vacuum cleaner, also known simply as a vacuum or a hoover, is a device that causes suction in order to remove dust from floors and other surfaces. It is generally electrically driven. The vacuum cleaner is an essential part of every home no matter how small. Many families have several vacuum cleaners for dedicated uses. These specialized uses have helped broaden the lines of vacuums made. Components of a vacuum cleaner are: an intake port, an exhaust port, an electric motor, a fan, a filter and a dust compartment. When the motor that is attached to the fan creates the wanted pressure drop at the exhaust port the ambient air is pushed into the vacuum cleaner through the intake port and the particles are suctioned into the dust compartment. The filter contains holes, which are small enough to stop the particles, but large enough to let the air go through. The dust air is filtered and flows through the exhaust port. What determines the suction power is the power of the fan, the shape of the air passageway and the size of the intake port’s opening. Uses & Market Potential: Vacuum cleaner market will grow at a CAGR of 4.63% in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. Rising benefits of vacuum cleaners is an essential factor driving the vacuum cleaner market. The high demand is attributed to shifting consumer preferences toward advanced cleaning appliances over manual cleaning methods. The rising household disposable income levels coupled with the increasing consumer awareness about health & hygiene across the globe will drive the household vacuum cleaners market growth.

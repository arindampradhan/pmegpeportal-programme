Description of Liquid Detergent Machine Machinery for Liquid Detergent includes the following: Liquid Agitator  mixing machine(for mixing of Chemicals)  Filling Machine  Liquid Detergent machines are used to produce Liquid cleaning substance from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span. Liquid Detergent Market Analysis According to “India Detergent Market Overview”, the overall market for detergent is growing with a CAGR of more than 10% from the last five years. Detergents are available in three forms namely powder detergent, bar detergent and liquid detergent. Powder detergents are widely accepted by Indian consumers and dominate the industry. Even though detergent bars are still used in rural areas, they are fast disappearing from the market because of ineffectiveness. Liquid detergent is a new category in the Indian market and was created by Hindustan Unilever in 2013 with the launch of country’s first liquid detergent. It has been two years for the launch of this liquid detergent under Surf Excel brand but still no other rival company has come up with liquid detergent. HUL’s intent is to move and create a liquid segment for the future, supporting its premiumization strategy. Although powder detergents are most commonly used because of their stability, eco-feasibility and long lasting

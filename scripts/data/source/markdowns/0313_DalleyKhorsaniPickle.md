DALLEY KHORSANI PICKLE UNIT Introduction: Chilli (Capsicum sp.) is a dicot plant that is self-pollinated and belongs to the Solanaceae family. Chilli had its origins in the tropics of South America. The word "capsicum" comes from the Greek word "kapsimo," which means "to pinch." There are about 25-30 varieties of Capsicum, five of which have been domesticated and cultivated: C. annuum L, C. frutescens mill, C. chinense, C. baccatum L., and C. pubescens. Capsicum is cultivated on 1.5 million hectares around the world, with a total of 10.60 million tonnes. It is cultivated on 0.775 million hectares in India, with an average yield of 1.6 metric tonnes per hectare. 2015, Indiastat.com. Dalle Khursani is a Capsicum annuum variety. It is primarily cultivated for its pungent fruits in Sikkim and its neighbouring areas, such as Darjeeling. The red cherry pepper (Capsicum annum var cerasiforme), also known as Dalle khursani in Sikkim, is valued for its distinct flavour and pungency. Capsicum is a member of the Solanaceae family and the genus Capsicum. In the open area, the plant can reach a height of 100-130 cm, and in the greenhouse, it can reach a height of 150-180 cm. Red Cherry Pepper pods come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including falling pods, upright pods, yellow pods, and circular pods. Each plant yields 2.5 to 3.0 kg of fruit with 500 to 1000 pods. Under safe conditions, the crop can be cultivated all year. Sikkim's Dalle khursani is a pungent chilli with many medicinal properties. It's used to make pickle, paste, powder, and dry chilli (chilli may be selected green or ripe for pickling). Dalle chilli produces capsaicin, a pungency-producing agent, as well as carotenoids and phenolic compounds, which are used as natural pigments and antioxidants.

Uses & Market Potential: The Himalayan fireball, also known as Dalle Khursani, is one of the world's hottest chilies. Darjeeling and Sikkim are two Himalayan regions where it is primarily cultivated. Dalle Khursani is one of the hottest chilies found in the Himalayan region, and it belongs to the Capsicum tribe. It has a round appearance that almost looks like a cherry when fully mature, and it is bright red when fully ripe from August to December. It is also a good source of income and livelihood for people in the Himalayan region, costing roughly Rs 200–400 per kilo. It's also well-known for its flavour and fragrance. This Himalayan fireball (Dalle Khursani) is eaten as an Achaar with meal (local language) in every Gorkha family's home in the Himalayan region (Darjeeling, Sikkim). In the Himalayan area, it is known as "Dalle KO Achaar," which translates to "Akbare Khursani." It's easy to figure out that it's also eaten with Momo (dumplings) and Thukpa, a common local dish. Because of its hot and spicy flavour, it is frequently eaten with the famous local dishes Momo (dumpling) and Thukpa. It is common during the cold winter months because it keeps the body warm with its heat. This chilli is processed in an airtight container with salt, mustard oil, and vinegar and can be preserved for several months. Before processing, it is put in a bamboo woven tray known as Nanglo in Nepali and held in direct sunlight for a day or two. It assists in the drying out of moisture as well as the longevity of the pickle for a long time. “Dalle KO Achaar” is usually served with

authentic Nepali cuisine. These closely packed chilli bottles are a hot commodity in the industry, even in small towns.

TWO-WHEELER AIR FILTER PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: Every automobile is fitted with an Air Filter. The function of an Air Filter is to filter air, which is being sucked by the engine during succession stroke. A filter removes dust and other suspended particles of air which may damage the engine of two wheelers. Hence the function of air filter is very vital. The design of air filter is different for different models of two wheelers normally an air filter assembly consists of Aluminium Alloy/Zinc Alloy die casted top & bottom, sheet metal body surrounded by filter material. A particulate air filter is a device composed of fibrous or porous materials which removes solid particulates such as dust, pollenetc from the air. Filters containing an adsorbentor catalyst such as charcoal (carbon) may also remove odors and gaseous pollutants such as volatile organic compounds or ozone. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Air intake is a kind of open loop system. The only way to avoid contaminants entry into engine is use of filter. Air which is sucked by engine must be clean as much as possible. Contaminated air affects performance of engine, increases fuel consumption, exhaust fumes which are harmful to the environment. A properly performing air filter resulting in to reduced wear and extended life. Air filter is expected to clean all pre-combustion air & supply it free from contaminants.

A well-designed air intake filter is associated with following general objectives: ✓ Engine durability ✓ Filtration ✓ Flow management ✓ Pressure or head loss constraints ✓ Overall noise, vibration, and harshness standards ✓ Service requirements ✓ Packaging ✓ Styling/appearance ✓ Emissions The demand of the Air Filters is closely linked with production of two wheelers in the country. These are required mainly as original equipment but these components have also replacement demand as a spare part. India automotive filter market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% during 2017 to 2023. Growth in the market is expected to be fueled by growing automobile sales, expanding vehicle fleet size and increasing purchasing power of consumers in the country. MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Basic machineries requirement are as follows: 1. Single Slide Table Type Vertical Injection Moulding Machine 2. Other machines and equipments

RAW MATERIAL: Basic raw materials are as follows: 1. Plastic Pellets (Depends on Two-Wheeler model, like Activa 3g uses PP) 2. Filter Paper (3-micron Filtration) 3. Packing Material MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The process employed is over moulding process which is one of three fundamental types of Injection moulding process. The raw materials used are procured from the local vendors and kept in the raw material inventory. At first, the mould of desired shape is precisely assembled in the clamping unit of the machine as per production requirement. The barrel heaters are started and brought to the desired temperature to melt down the thermoplastic pellets to be used for overmolding process. Plastic pellets are then brought from the raw material inventory and fed into the hopper of the machine. From the hopper, these plastic pellets come into the feed section of the barrel. There is a screw inside the barrel which rotates about the vertical axis and moves the pellets into heating section of barrel where these plastic pellets melt to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the mould of the machine. Filter Paper are placed manually in the mould at the prescribed layout with precision. After this operator initiates the over moulding process thus, clamping unit slides inward and the injection unit moves down. After this charging of cavity is performed by the application hydraulic force at desired pressure. After the charging completes water cooling of the mould is performed with cooling arrangements. After the cooling, the injection unit moves upward and the clamping unit slides outward. The ejector pins will eject the final product from the cavity. Thus, air filter is obtained which can then be packed appropriately and be sent for sale.

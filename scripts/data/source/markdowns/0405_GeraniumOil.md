GERANIUM OIL PROCESSING PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: Geranium is a perennial shrub with small pink flowers & pointy leaves that is native to South Africa. Out of the many varieties of the plant, Geranium (scientific name of Geranium- Pelagroniumgraveolens) is the source of essential oil. Geranium essential oil is derived by distillation of the leaves of geranium plant. According to folklore, it was used for a wide range of health conditions. Geranium oil is grown in many regions, including Europe and Asia. There are many varieties and strains of the pink flower with a fresh, floral fragrance. Each variety differs in scent, but is nearly-identical in terms of composition, benefits, and uses. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Geranium oil is a type of essentially oil generally used in aromatherapy. Sourced from the flowers and leaves of the Pelagroniumgraveolens plant, the geranium essential offers a variety of health benefits. Geranium oil contains a number of compounds thought to enhance health, including citronellol and geraniol. Geranium essential oil has antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties, which make it beneficial for reducing acne breakouts, skin irritation, and skin infections when applied externally.

Geranium essential oil’s anti-inflammatory properties also make it beneficial for a number of inflammatory conditions, including those affecting skin. The overall demand for essential oil has been on the rise over the past few years which is attributable to the rising awareness about the health benefits associated with the product. An ever-increasing global population, rapid urbanisation, a growing pharmaceutical sector, and rising geriatric population are some of the significant factors that are influencing a steady shift in consumer preferences. Another major factor that is responsible for the unprecedented growth of geranium essential oil market is that there is no other alternative for natural ingredients. MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Basic machinery requirement are as follows: 1. Heating Vessel 2. Condenser 3. Steam Pipe 4. Separator 5. Water Pump 6. Cooling Tower 7. Water Tank 8. Filling Machine RAW MATERIAL: Basic raw material requirements are as follows: 1. Geranium Shoot 2. Packing Material (Bottles)

EXTRACTION PROCESS: The Geranium Shoots are purchased from farmers and stored temporarily in a shaded area; it acts as a raw material inventory for distillation unit. The steam and hydro distillation methods are generally employed to perform a simple distillation process. The Geranium Shoot are boiled with water in a heating vessel and are boiled for 3 to 4hrs for optimal extraction, during this period the steam generated carries along with it Geranium Oil as it also get vaporized from within shoot of plant. This steam is transferred to condenser via steam pipe, as condenser is circulated with cooling water continuously utilizing a pump, thus steam transferred to condenser undergoes condensation completing distillation process, while used cooling water is sent to cooling tower where it undergoes evaporative cooling to lower its temperature and become reusable for cooling. The cooled water in cooling tower pump is replenished periodically with make-up water from another water tank, if required via a make-up water pump to make up for evaporated water in evaporative cooling. The contents (Water + Geranium Oil) obtained from condenser are supplied to separator and then the liquid is allowed to settle down and as oil and water are immiscible, water settles below while Geranium Oil settles above water layer. A valve is located at bottom of the separator which is used to drain almost all the water from separator, this water is supplied back to heating vessel for enrichment purpose. The enrichment process continues for 3 to 4hrs, after which most of the Geranium oil is extracted and it’s not feasible to go after the remainder of portion. Now water is completely drained from separator and oil is supplied to a filling machine. The filling machine fills the geranium oil in appropriate sized bottles which can range from 10ml to 500ml and machine setting are made accordingly.

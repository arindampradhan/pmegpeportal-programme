PLASTIC TOOTHPICK Introduction: Oral care products are defined as products used for care of the teeth and the mouth. A plastic toothpick is a small thin stick of plastic with at least one and sometimes two pointed ends to insert between teeth to remove detritus, usually after a meal. Plastic toothpicks are also used for festive occasions to hold or spear small appetizers (like cheese cubes or olives) or as a cocktail stick, and can be decorated with plastic frills or small paper umbrellas or flags. The toothpick is a commonly used tool to help dislodge food from between your teeth. Toothpicks are handy, convenient and readily available. While they are helpful in dislodging food from your teeth, toothpicks are not designed for dental cleaning and should not be substituted for flossing or brushing. Flossing is the preferred method for removing food and plaque from between your teeth. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Increasing dental problems among children and adults, due to poor eating habits, and the rise in popularity for

oral care and cleaning products are the factors primarily driving the toothpicks market. Moreover, rising premiumization and consumers seeking more targeted solutions are accelerating the growth of the market studied. The rise in consciousness of oral health has helped vendors introduce oral hygiene product categories, like teeth-flossing products. One of the popular products used for teeth whitening is toothpicks. Product: Plastic Toothpicks Raw Material: 1. PVC Granules (Medical Grade) 2. Plasticizers 3. PVC Stabilizers 4.

Manufacturing Process: Fig.1 – Flow Chart In the first step, the raw material is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the profile dies are mounted precisely in the injection moulding machine as per product dimension. The die can have the arrangement of moulding a number of pieces in a single cycle as required. After this, barrel heaters of the injection moulding machine of screw barrel are started and brought up to desired melting temperature of the PVC. In the next step, the pellets are added into the hopper of the injection moulding machine manually after weighing over scale. The pellets from the hopper are fed into the barrel section of the machine where the screw mounted in the machine rotates about horizontal axis. The pellets are fed into heating zone as the screw rotates. In the heating zone, plastic pellets melt to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the mold of the machine. From the extruded of the machine this molten plastic pellets are injected into the die at desired pressure and temperature. The molten plastic will acquire

the shape of the die and cooling cycle of the machine begins. Water is used as a cooling medium which transfers heating through a suitable cooling arrangement. The molten plastic gets solidified and acquires the shape of the die. After this, when the cooling cycle completes, the mold gets opened and the ejector pin will ejects the toothpicks outside. After this, the common runner has been removed and toothpick gets separated out. After this, the uneven excess lines, burrs are removed. The non-uniform or deformed products are crushed using grinder into small pieces. After this, the toothpicks are packed and dispatched as per the requirement. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 - 1500Sqft. Machines: 1. Injection Moulding Machine– Injection molding is a method to obtain molded products by injecting plastic materials molten by heat into a mold, and then cooling and solidifying them. The method is suitable for the mass production of products with complicated shapes, and takes a large part in the area of plastic processing.

Introduction of the Product Plaster of Paris which is calcium sulphate with half molecule of water of crystallization (Ca So ½ H o) and hygroscopic characteristics obtained by duly 4. 2 calcined the raw material i.e. Gypsum (Ca So 2H o). It possesses outstanding 4 2 property of setting and subsequent hardening when mixed with water. Plaster of Paris is extensively used in ceramic industry for preparation models and moulds. It is also used as main raw material in the manufacture of toys & statues, chalk crayons, gypsum plaster boards, and decorative picture frames besides wide range of applications in the interior decoration of buildings and other establishments. Plant capacity per year: - 1,200 MT Market & Demand Aspects As there is growing building construction activity thus requiring large quantities of Plaster of Paris. Demand for the product is also increasing in making mould & models. There is also considerable demand for the plaster of Paris arising from a large number of studies and establishments engaged in making statutes and interior decoration as well as decorative plaster boards for false ceiling etc, which is in turn creating a good scope for setting up new units in this line of manufacture. Raw material: - Gypsum Manufacturing Process and Source of Technology Gypsum is the basic raw material required to manufacture Plaster of Paris. These are cleaned and washed for removal of impurities, dried in sunlight and then pulverized. Gypsum powders are calcined in a rotary drum calcinatory using light diesel oil/firewood/coal as fuel. The low pressure burner is sufficient to reach the calcinations temp. ranges from 1600C to 1800C. The process of calcinations is done over a period of about 2 hours, so that 1½ molecule of water is removed to obtain the required properties. After cooling the calcined powder is passed through 150 mesh and packed in airtight polythene lined gunny bags. This technology is locally available and also can be availed from Central Building Research Institute, Roorke (UP). Basis of Project Selection:- An entrepreneur is said to be an opportunity seeker. For the potential entrepreneur his/her first task is to identify, explore and then select the business opportunity. Presumption:-  The proposed project envisaged to manufacture 3 MT per day.  The unit will run on single shift basis per day and 300 working days per year at 75% capacity utilization.  To achieve production capacity, 15 days trial production is required.  The salary & wages is considered on the basis of prevailing market rate.  The break-even point is calculated on full capacity utilization basis. 2

1. INTRODUCTION Amaranth in Hindi is known as Rajgira. Simply put, Rajgira means raj (royal) & gira (grain). As a matter of fact, amaranth grain meaning in Gujarati is also Rajgira. Moreover, amaranth grain in India is also known as 'Ramdana', meaning God’s own grain. Amaranthus is a genus (family Amaranthaceae) consisting of more than 50 species and is a pseudocereal that was domesticated in America over 4000 years ago by the Aztecs and Mayas. The importance of amaranth has resurged in the last years due to agricultural features, since it is a fast-growing cultivar with tolerance to drought conditions, can grow in poor soils, and has important nutritional properties. Moreover, it has minerals, such as calcium, sodium, iron, magnesium, and vitamin E. Polyphenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which have been characterized in amaranth grains, which makes it an excellent source of bioactive compounds. Typically, amaranth grain is not eaten raw and suffers a variety of processing methods in order to achieve desired flavor, color, texture, and, sometimes, nutritional

and nutraceutical properties. The different processing methods considered in this chapter such as cooking in water, toasting, fermentation, germination, or extrusion affect the nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics that have beneficial effects on human health. The health benefits of amaranth come from nutrients and, in part, through the antioxidant characteristic of the phenolic compounds present in the grain, so that changes and variation in the composition and concentration of Nutrients and non-nutrient could indicate the type of amaranth grain processing that can preserve its nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  There are various ways to use amaranth as a part of the daily diet:  Boil whole amaranth grains can be used to make porridge.  Pop dried amaranth can be used as popcorn and it is eaten as a snack.  Popped amaranth can be also used as salads or in soups.  Amaranth oil can be used in dietary supplements and cosmetics.  Amaranth seed also can be used as flaked, extruded, and ground flour . 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT  Harvested amaranths seed  Packaging material 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Harvesting Harvesting is very important in the processing because the right stage of amaranths harvesting play an important role. Since amaranth grain shutters quickly, it is best to harvest the crop as soon as the panicle/head colour changes from green to golden brown and seeds fall on the light

shaking of the vine. To avoid seed failure, cut off the heads and place them in a jar like a gunny bag or a bucket it detaches from the stem and falls into the container. Threshing and storage of grains Place the panicles on a clean polythene sheet to dry. These panicles after proper drying are threshed using a thresher machine. After threshing, these grains are properly dried in sunlight or an air dryer machine the correct moisture content for storing grain amaranth is 11-13%. Grain delivery: The grain is supplied by covered trucks to factories. The distance travelled by the grain varies tremendously. After arriving at the mill, grain stocks will often have gone through a variety of accumulation processes (farmer, country elevator, terminal elevator, etc.). The number of conveyances carrying grain can vary based on the time of harvesting and delivery. Cleaning of seed Amaranths Seed cleaning for removal of extraneous material like stones, mud, etc. De-stoning: The aim of this process is that removes stones and other particles impurities from the amaranths seed. Magnetic separation: The amaranths seeds first pass by a magnetic separator that removes ferrous metal particles. It is also necessary to ensure that no metal pieces are in the finished product. Gravity separation The gravity separator separates products of same size but with difference in specific weight. Seed grading As it is small grain bus also it is a value additional optional process to obtain uniform size seed. Weighing Packaging The packaging is done in a simple manner: the amaranth seed are fed into the packaging machine's holding tank, which then weighs and fills the amaranth seed into the appropriate packages. It simply fills the sacs to the desired weight and sews the other end.

 Magnetic Separator: It’s a type of separator which is used to magnetic impurities from given product using powerful electromagnets, used in wide range of industries for separation.  Gravity separator: The gravity separator is used to separate any type of kernel or granular product that is nearly identical in size but differs in weight.  Packaging machine: A machine for automated weighing and packaging supports the exact weighing and packaging of Amaranths seed. The machine weighs and fills the products with precise measures.

Indian Feed Sector. India is one of the largest and fastest growing compound feed markets in the world. Feed manufacturing on a commercial and scientific basis started around 1965 in India with the setting up of medium‐sized feed plants in northern and western India. Feed was produced mainly to cater to the needs of dairy cattle. The poultry sector was not developed at that time and was restricted to backyard production, with the desi (or native bird) kept mainly for the production of eggs. The Indian feed industry is undergoing a very exciting phase of growth for the next decade. Indian feed industry is presently growing at a CAGR of 8 percent. Poultry, aqua and dairy industry occupies the major share in overall feed demand. While the potential feed requirement is huge and stands at around 96 million tonnes, only 20.3 million tonnes was produced during 2012‐13. There is a huge scope for the growth in the sector, with industry becoming more organized. With this growth rate India will soon become the largest feed market in the coming years. The feed industry requirements that are met with the compound feed are only 11 percent for cattle, 14 percent for aqua feed and 55 percent for poultry feed. Animal Feed Market Poultry Cattle Aqua Others The poultry industry has grown at an annual growth rate of percent from 2002 to around 2013. The seafood sector is also witnessing a growth of 6 percent annually in production of aquaculture. Simultaneously, Indian dairy sector has also been growing at a rate of 4 percent annually. Growth in these sectors has pushed up the demand for compound feed by 50 percent. India’s demand for compound feed is expected to rise 28 million tonnes by 2017‐18 However, majority of the feed production is highly fragmented, composed mostly of home and custom mixers. The table below provides a detailed breakup of animal feed industry into various segments – Poultry (broiler and layer), cattle and aqua in India.

Cattle and buffalo are usually fed on wheat, paddy, millet, sugarcane tops and other straws and stovers. These are supplemented with small quantity of grass available from grazing. Very limited amount of concentrate is fed to the animals. According to National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), the livestock feeding systems in India is categorized into six major types: 1. Dry Fodder + Compound Feed + Concentrate Feed 2. Dry Fodder + Green Fodder + Compound Feed + Concentrate Feed 3. Dry Fodder + Homemade Concentrate Mix + Grazing 4. Green Fodder + Compound Feed + Concentrate Feed 5. Silage + Dry Fodder + Concentrate Feed 6.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS. Cattle feed is precisely obtained by blending the concerned raw material in desired quantity to get the particular cattle feed. The raw material are ground first individually and is latter feed into mixer to obtain homogenous mixing , where after it is transported to the pulverizer, where it is pulverized to the required mesh size. The product is then screened to obtain the required particle size. There after it is mixed with molasses. According to the given formulation take a requisite quantity of raw material. These raw materials are pulverized to their required mesh size. After pulverization the mass is fed to the mixing section, where it is intimately mixed with minerals, vitamins and other ingredients, when the ingredients are well mixed then the whole mass is fed to pelletizing machine to get cattle feed in pellets form. Now, the pellets are tested in laboratory to confirm the analytical value.

Reception:‐ The raw materials usually arrive at the factory in sacks, which can be either man handled or conveyed mechanically into the ware house. Since quality control is an important part of feed compounding, checks should be made on the weight & condition of the incoming raw materials & samples should be taken for laboratory analysis where possible. Storage of Raw Materials:‐ In coming raw materials should be stored conditions which ensure that they are kept dry & free from insect & rodent pests. If they are to be stored in bags. They should be kept in a produce ware house constructed to an appropriates standard. The ware house should have a concrete floor but the roof & walls need only be lightly constructed, provided of course that they are pest & water roof. As a rough guide to the space requirements 6 Sq. ft. ton of stored materials regd. The amount stored will vary firm time to time since storage can be used to even out fluctuations in the supply of individual ingredients a n d allows advantage to be taken of price fluctuations. Raw materials may also be bulk stored either in silos constructed from concrete or steel or in bins formed with partitions in conventional stores. In general bulk storage entails a great, i n v e s t m e n t in capital, e q u i p m e n t but lower operating costs working capital which would be tied up in the bags used to contain the raw materials is also released.

The particular method chosen for low materials storage will depend on the local circumstances but in areas where labour is cheap & plentiful & capital funds scarce, it is likely the storage in bags will be preferable. Grinding:‐ Some material including cereals & oil seed cakes, need grinding to prepare then for blending and or mixing. In same units materials are first blended then ground before mixing in other, they are ground first then blended mixed of time the grinder can be kept supplied with material. Blending:‐ Blending involves the assembling & measuring out of the required quantities of raw material. The raw materials are brought manually from the ware house & weighed out in batches. Those which need grinding are tipped into the foot of the elevator which feeds the grinder less, the other material are into the base of the mixer. In some units blending is semi mechanical material used in large quantities are elevated into one of the four bulk bins. An operator determines which bin is filled by means of a four‐ way switch. The material flows out of the bins under gravity into one of the two batch weighs the flow being controlled by an operator. Who opens & closes a flow in response to readings from a dial which registers the amount of material in the weigher. The weight of each raw material in any batch & the no of batches in each formulation is predetermined. In all cases, the raw materials, blended or single, are fed into an elevator which feeds a grinder bin. The out let of these bin incorporate a magnetic tray & a oslesating feed which regulator the flow of material into the grinder so that the load on the grinder motor is kept at the optimum level. All the grinders are hammer mills, also known as unijact grinders. These are the most suitable type available at present for use in feed compounding. The other common types disc grinders & roller grinders, have their own applications but are not usual in feed mills. Both have a higher capital cost than however, mills of similar capacity & produce products with qualities that hammer mills cannot achieve. The material enters a chamber in which set of beaters revolve driven by and an electric motor. The beaters throw the material against the projections on the inner surface of the chamber, which breaks up the material & against a perforated screen. Through which the ground material passes. Wear on the beaters, projections & screen is slight but they can be dawaged by foreign bodies such as stores, glass or metal objects entering the grinder chamber.

After the material has passed through the screen, it is blow through a pipe into a cyclone which collects the ground material. Certain mixtures of air & dust, created by the grinders are explosive, esp. when, as in a grinder, these is a risk of sparks. Because of the dangers of explosion, the grinders are contained in special structures either above or below ground. The size & capacity of the grinder required depends on the amount of materials to be ground the finesses of grind required & the amount when a batch is complete, it is elevated to the grinder bin & ground.

KVIC- REGP-Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana Project Profile on Neon Sign Boards Introduction : The Neon sign board is one of the most popular and attractive media of advertisement widely used by industrial and commercial firms to popularise their proudcts among the general public. The neon sign board that is installed on tall buildings attracts the attention of people even from distant places and hence it is ideally suited for advertisements in busy places like big town and cities.

After liberalization of economic policy, variety of foreign goods are available every where at cheap rates creating tough competition for industrial and consumer goods in the local market and advertisement has become very essential for the success of any business activity., Process of Manufacture: The Neon tubular lamp that is used in the Neon Sign Board is a cold cathode type discharge lamp in which discharge takes place between two electrodes placed at the ends of the tube. In long tubular lamps used for advertisement purposes, several thousand volts is applied between electrodes for which supply is given through a high voltage transformer having high leakage reactance. The Neon lamp of different colours are used for advertisement purposes and the desired colour is produced either by filling lamp with suitable gas or by using glass tubes coated with suitable fluorescent material as per the requirements. Now a days latter method is generally adopted for producing Neon lamp of different colours. 1 Name of the Product : Neon Sign Boards 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Worksheds iqn. msqtr.fst 75 Rs.

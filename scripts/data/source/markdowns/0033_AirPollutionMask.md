ANTI-POLLUTION MASK Introduction Anti-Pollution Mask is also known as air pollution mask & Dust Mask. A dust mask is a flexible pad held over the nose and mouth by elastic or rubber straps to protect against dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass pr oduction), or sweeping. Mask can also be worn to protect against allergens. A dust mask is worn in the same fashion as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each protect against specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust masks with widely varied levels of protection may look similar and even masks that do not protect against dust at all, such as paint masks and surgical masks. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to protect against splattering liquids or mists. Dust masks are manufactured to protect against only certain dangers, and do not protect against chemicals such as vapours and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust masks with paint masks. The most commonly used equipment to combat air pollution is an anti-pollution mask. Health benefits of Anti-Pollution Mask Air pollution consists of a variety of harmful airborne particulates like soot, smoke, gases, chemical vapour and residue. The main sources are vehicle emissions and industrial processes. The purpose of an anti-pollution mask is to filter out harmful particulates in the ambient air. Following multiple tests, it seems that tightness of fit is crucial. Facial hair prevents a good seal and the fit also depends on the shape of the wearer’s face. wearers is to wear a mask for short periods and only when you feel it is essential.

Wearing face masks had lower blood pressure and better regulated heart rates & using face masks can reduce the spread of disease. Description of Anti-Pollution Mask Machine Machinery for Anti-Pollution Mask includes the following:  Sewing Machine  Other equipment’s  Desktop for designing These Machines are used to manufacture Anti-Pollution mask from different types of raw material. With the help of this machine the work of cutting, stitching, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span. Anti-pollution Mask Market Analysis The market for anti-pollution masks in India is likely to increase to USD 16.86 million (about Rs 118 crore) by 2023 due to deteriorating air quality and rapid urbanisation, a report by industry body Assocham, "India anti-pollution masks market may generate revenue of USD 16.86 million by end of 2023 from USD 6.16 million (about Rs 43 crore) in 2017," it said. Besides, increasing per capita expenditure on healthcare and rising awareness are anticipated to fuel demand for pollution masks in India in the coming years.

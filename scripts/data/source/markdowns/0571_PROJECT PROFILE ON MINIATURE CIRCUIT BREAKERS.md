"KVIC- PMEGP" PROJECT PROFILE ON MINIATURE CIRCUIT BREAKERS Introduction : Miniature Circuit Breaker (M. C. B) is a precision electromagnetic device which is fast replacing the conventional main switch and fuse units used in the control of electric supply. With the use of MCB no replacement of blown fuse is required and the risk of connecting wrong size of fuse wire eliminated. It operates automatically and opens the circuit in case of electric overload or short circut. There is no permanent deformation and it can be safely switched on again manually. Because of its precise calibration it is much more reliable than the rewireable fuse. It thereby effectively protects the electrical wiring and equipment. The MCBs are employed in many commercial / industrial establishments, hotels, theatres, houses etc. Thae use of MCBs saves the sophisticated equipments like T. V. Air, Conditioner, Refrigerator, Heating appliance etc. from short circut and voltage fluctuation. These are finding vase use in domestic sector as protective device. 1 Name of the Product : MINIATURE CIRCUIT BREAKERS 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.

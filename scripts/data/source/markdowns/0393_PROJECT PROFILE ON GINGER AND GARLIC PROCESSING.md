## Page 1

"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" PROJECT PROFILE ON GINGER AND GARLIC PROCESSING Introduction : Ginger & Garlic are important commercial crops cultivated through out the country with major poduction in the state of Gujarat, Orissa, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh & Uttar Pradesh. Garlic is mainly used as a condiment in food preparations and is also used as carminative and gastric stimulatn in many medicinal preparations. Processing of ginger is undertaken to dehydrate it and for preparing ginger candy. Ginger & Garlic-based products have wide applications in food processing as well as many other industries. A Proper market survey has to be conducted to find out demand potential for each industry segment. Process of Manufacture: In case of dyhydration of garlic,cloves are separated manually and then dehydration is done in a drier at about 55-60 C tempeature. As regards ginger, fresh ginger is soaked in water and washed and then outer skin is peeled of in a barrel drum. Skin peeling facilities removal of moisture. Drying is done in the electrically-heated thermostatic-controlled drier. Drier is combined with steam heating arrangement. Drying temperatur is in the range of 55-60'0 C. Ginger for producing candy has to be rich in flavour and juice and fibreless and quantity of citric acid for about an hour under a pressure of 10 or for 6 hours under atmostpheric pressure to improve its colour. Thent the mixure is boild with 30% sugar solution for 15 minutes and kept overnight. Same operation is repeated everyday till the sugar content is 60 brix and then small quantity of citric acid is added and the solution is boile and kept till sugar penetrates in ginger. Finally, it is boiled for about 5 minutes and the sugar solution is drained out and pieces of ginger are rolled in ground sugar, dried and packed. 1 Name of the Product : GINGER AND GARLIC PROCESSING 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.

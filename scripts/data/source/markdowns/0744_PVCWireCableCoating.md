PVC WIRE & CABLE COATING Introduction: PVC Cables are used for power distribution in all types of electrical wiring, control cables, Telephone cables and signaling in Railways. With the development of industrial sector and with increase in power generation the demand of the cable is going to be more. Uses & Market Potential: PVC wire and cables are used in all sectors including housing, electric appliances, vehicles, flexible and cord cables for appliances, Machine Tools and Equipment Wiring Heavy Duty Domestic Wires for House Wiring, Power supply and distribution for houses and other construction needs. The PVC wire and cable industry is an integral part of plastic processing industry which has witnessed an impressive rate of around 15% during last five years. The main reason being the growth of endues industry namely, building and construction due to aggressive activities in this sector. The wires and cable industry outlook therefore also shows good potential. The PVC wire and cable industry has already established its place and credentials as well as competitive advantage in the construction industry. The industry therefore is expected to register healthy growth.

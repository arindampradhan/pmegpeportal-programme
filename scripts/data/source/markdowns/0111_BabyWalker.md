BABY WALKER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Baby walkers assist new-borns in taking their first steps. With wheels, a seat, and a sturdy frame, this is a non-essential nursery item. In a restricted environment, young new-borns who are unable to walk move around quickly by using aggressive force. A tray containing toys or jangles is standard on baby walkers. The evolution of baby walkers began in the 15th century, with advances leading to the present type of synthetic-material baby walkers. Almost half of the world's infants are forced to use a baby walker to help them develop their walking abilities. However, several accidents and injuries have been documented as a result of the use of baby walkers. These occurrences might be hazardous at times for two reasons. The first is the child's increasing mobility and speed. Another aspect is the child's increased height and reach while seated in a walker. To attract greater volume sales in the market, baby walkers come in a variety of styles and creative functions. Baby walkers are portable because they may be folded and transported from one location to another.

Uses & Market Potential: A baby walker is a device that allows infants who are unable to walk independently to travel from one location to another. Toddlers can also use modern baby walkers. They have a hard-plastic base with wheels on top, as well as a suspended cloth seat with two leg openings. The worldwide baby walker market is well-established in many areas of the globe, and it is fueled by a number of factors. One of the key reasons that will likely have a favorable influence on the market's growth over the next five years is expansion through organised retail, which is occurring all over the world. With changing government rules and evolving customer buying behaviour from conventional to contemporary retail channels, organised retail's proportion of the market is growing. The expansion of organised retail is assisting multinational companies in their penetration as well as increasing product visibility. This is projected to lead to increased expenditure on baby walkers, resulting in considerable market growth during the forecast period. The worldwide baby walker market is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.1 percent from 2016 to 2020, according to experts. Product: Baby Walker Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Food Grade PP Pellets  Steel Pipes  Cloth Fabrics

GROUNDNUT PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Groundnut is an oilseed that comes from the groundnut fruit. It is referred to as a nut in general, but it is not a nut exactly in actual terms; rather, it is a seed that goes by the name of peanut. The groundnut plant is an annual herb plant that belongs to the Fabaceae family. The plant has feathery leaves, yellow flowers, and a legume-shaped fruit with two to three seeds that grow within the ground. Oil is also obtained from groundnut seeds, which are high in vitamin E, fatty acids, and carbohydrates and are widely used as a cooking medium, lighting fuel, and food ingredient. Groundnut is considered one of the world's most valuable oilseed crops. It is developed in over 100 countries around the world and is extremely important to the global economy. The seeds are a good source of the groundnut oil cake's edible oil and proteins. The oil and protein percentages derived from the seed are approximately 55 and 28 percent, respectively. After the oil is extracted, the oil cake meal is used as animal feed and fertilizer. The key components of the groundnut seed are edible oil (45%) and protein (26 percent ). It's also high in thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, vitamin E, and all of the B vitamins, except B12.

Uses & Market Potential: Groundnut seeds are eaten raw (uncooked), boiled, and roasted, and their flour is used to make confections and baked goods. Groundnut shells are used to make particle boards, as well as being used as a fuel or filler in the fertilizer and feed industries. Groundnut haulms are a good source of protein for livestock. Earthnuts, goober peas, monkey nuts, pygmy nuts, and pig nuts are some of the other local names for Groundnuts. The peanut, despite its name and shape, is a legume, not a nut. India is the world's second- largest producer of groundnuts. There are three types of Indian groundnuts: Bold or Runner, Java or Spanish, and Red Natal. They have a rich nutty flavour, a sweet taste, a crunchy texture, and a longer shelf life than most nuts. Some growing regions have ideal soil conditions for dry, clean, and spotless Groundnuts in Shell. Indian groundnut shellers and processors are becoming increasingly aware of and concerned about efficiency. Multiple grading and sorting are quickly becoming the standard. Indian factories are capable of processing and producing edible peanuts that meet the highest quality requirements.

Raw Material: Raw material that are used are Harvested Groundnut pod and packing material. Manufacturing Process:  Raw material procurement  Drying  Stripping  Cleaning  Storage  Shelling or decorticating  Cleaning  Grading Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1200-1800Sqft.

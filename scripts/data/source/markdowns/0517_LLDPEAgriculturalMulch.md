LLDPE AGRICULTURAL MULCH FILM Introduction: The use of plastic in the agricultural sector has contributed to greater efficiency and crop productivity. That is why the use of plastics in agriculture has significantly increased worldwide in the last 60 years. The main agricultural films are: geomembrane film, silage film, mulch film and film for covering greenhouses. Mulch film is specially designed for those crops that are planted using saplings. The main objective of this film is to protect the crop from the proliferation of weeds, preventing the weeds’ growth from hindering the development of the plants. Furthermore, the film protects the crops and the soil from possible adverse weather conditions. Lowdensity polyethylene (LDPE) and lineal low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which are focussed on translucent or coloured film provides opacity. Benefits of Plastic Mulch Film: Covering the soil around the plant with plastic film results in the following benefits:

1. Moisture retention (particularly valuable in high temperature regions with low rainfall). 2. Weed reduction 3. Increase in soil temperature 4. Less crop contamination 5. Less soil compaction 6. Improved germination rates These benefits lead to higher yields (by upto 100% for certain crops) earlier crops (by upto one month) and in some cases the ability to grow certain crop, which would not be possible without the mulch film. Raw material: Major raw material that is required is LLDPE Granules. Machinery requirements: Major machines & equipments that are required are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Amount Extrusion Blown Film Plant (90 1 2200000 2200000 mm) capacity 120 kgs./hour Cooling Tower 1 300000 300000 Compressor 1 300000 300000 Cost of Mold and Dies Ls 200000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 200000 Total Amount 3200000 Manufacturing Process: The manufacturing process used to manufacture LLDPE agricultural film is extrusion. The film thickness range varies between 100-800 gauge and the lay flat tubing width of the film varies between 450 mm to 2100 mm (18” to 84”). LLDPE granules are fed to a single screw extruder, where they are melted & pumped out of a die in the form of a tube.

This is then inflated such that it takes a shape of a bubble. The bubble formed is collapsed & drawn upwards by two nip rolls. Flattened tube is then wound on a winder. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security Guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

Parts are assembled and welded into a unanimous  Assembling- whole. Beating improves the rigidity and flexibility of the metal. The vessel in this way is the most fragile at the focuses where it has been welded. Handles are not joined in this type of cookware and utensils are utilized all things considered.  Scraping- Vessels are dingy dark in shading and the outside of cooking vessels is left dirty however within dingy layer is scratched off.  Coating- The base surface of the vessel is warmed, adhered to lac and covered with tin oil. This is done to expand the thickness of the base with the goal that food doesn't adhere to the inner parts of the vessel during cooking.  Finishing- Washing with acid to make them appear like gold. To decorate, flat metal pieces are cut and beaten onto the ware with a hammer. Designs may also be carved out on the metal using an iron pointed tip pen.

SMART ENERGY METER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Smart energy meter is an electronic device that measures the most accurate amount of electricity consumed by a residence, business or any electrically-powered device. A smart meter is reliable source for most accurate information of consumed energy that reduces the chance of error in the existing billing system to minimal, voltage levels, current, and power factor. Smart meters communicate the information to the consumer for greater clarity of consumption behavior, and electricity suppliers for system monitoring and customer billing. Smart meters typically record energy near real- time, and report regularly, short intervals throughout the day. A smart meter appears to be very similar to a traditional electricity, gas, or water meter located in a residence or business. Both smart and traditional meters provide metrology by measuring quantities of voltage, current, pressure, velocity, temperature, or flow rate, and communicate this information to the utility. The difference between the two types is that smart meter’s record consumption in intervals of an hour or less. Additionally, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) of smart meters provides two-way communication between the utility and the user, and AMI supports remote reporting.

Uses & Market Potential: Smart Energy meters are tools used to manage and record electricity and performance of electronic devices in the home. What makes the meters "smart" is their ability to provide detailed and accurate analytics on electrical usage in real-time or at predetermined intervals, all without a technician. The global smart meter market size was valued at $21.13 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $39.20 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 8.80% during the forecast period. Smart meters are electronic devices that accurately monitor electricity, gas, and water usage. These smart meters can send usage information through power line communication, radiofrequency electromagne t ic radiation (RF), and cellular communication, helping the utility company to effectively manage the energy usage. Smart meters offer a host of benefits such as reduction of meter reading cost, preventing disconnection, removing inefficiencies in billing, and re- connection costs to corporations and consumers. The major factor that drives the smart meter market growth is supportive government policies and financial incentives. In addition, large scale installations of the smart meters by the utility companies are focusing on strengthening the distribution of the smart meters. Various benefits offered by the smart meter market such as automatic meter reading and bill generation are further expected to contribute towards the growth of the smart meter industry.

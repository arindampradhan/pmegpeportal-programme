SESAME SEED PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is India's oldest indigenous oilseed crop and has been cultivated for the longest time in India. In Hindi sesame or gingelly is known as Til. The crop is grown in almost all parts of the country. West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana account for more than 85% of sesame output. India is the world's leading producer, with 19.47 million hectares area and 8.66 million tonnes produced. India's average sesame yield (413 kg/ha) is low as compared to other countries (535 kg/ha). Improved sesame varieties and agro-production technologies capable of rising sesame productivity are now being established for various agro-ecological situations in the region. In irrigated conditions, a well-managed sesame crop can yield 1200 - 1500 kg/ha, and in rain fed conditions, 800 - 1000 kg/ha. Sesame is Produces primarily for its edible seeds and oil, with 65 percent of the seeds used for oil extraction and 35 percent for human consumption. Sesame seeds have a high oil content and a pleasant nutty taste when cooked. They are highly valued in the bakery, candy industry, and other food specialties for these purposes. Two distinct types of seed are recognized, the white and the black. There are also intermediate coloured varieties varying from red to rose or from brown or grey.

producer and exporter of sesame seeds. The outer husk has been extracted from sesame seeds, giving them a tiny flat creamy white look (hulled).

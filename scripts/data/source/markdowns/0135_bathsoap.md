BATH SOAP Introduction Soap is the term for a salt of a fatty acid or for a variety of cleansing and lubricating products produced from such a substance. Household uses for soaps include washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry, they are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts. Bath Soap is formulated to clean body. It is also known as body soap. Body soap contains skin friendly soaps in solution form that are anything but easy to utilize and exceptionally compelling in eliminating germs and microscopic organisms from body. Bath soaps are cleaning products that have become an essential commodity in our daily lives. Cleaning products play an essential role in our daily lives. By safely and effectively removing soils, germs and other contaminants, they help us to stay healthy & pleasant. Qualities of good Bath Soap 1. Bubbly – this gives the soaps ability to lather 2. Cleansing – the ability of the soap to trap the dirt on the skin and wash it away 3. Hardness – the firmness of the soap bar 4. Conditioning – the amount of moisture that is left on the skin 5. Creamy – this measures the stability and creaminess of the soap lather Formulation Soap is the result of a full chemical reaction in which a section of an oil molecule (or fatty acid) attaches to a sodium ion. By choosing oils that have specific molecular properties (in other words, choosing the right fatty acids) and blending them in the right proportions, it’s possible to create the results we want in our soaps – creamy, fluffy lather that’s extra moisturizing in a long-lasting bar.

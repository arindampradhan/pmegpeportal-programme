PROJECT REPORT ON SUGARCANE JUICE MAKING PLANT INTRODUCTION: There has been increasing demand for soft drinks and fruit based beverages. Sugarcane juices can be one such drink which can be available for consumers in tetra pack or glass bottles or plastic bottles. Sugarcane is widely used in variety of products such as making gur and khandsari. India is among top five producers of Sugarcane. Sugarcane itself has lot of medicinal and curative properties. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Bottled or Tetra-Packed sugarcane juices can be very useful to consumers as it can be carried, store anywhere easily. 200 ml package can be useful for single person to consume easily and s/he can get good amount of nutrition compared to other beverages. It contains natural sugars, minerals like iron, magnesium, phosphorous, calcium and organic acids e.g. malic acid, succinic acid, acotinic acid, amino acid, protein, starch, gums, waxes, non-sugar phosphatides. INDUSTRY LOOKOUT AND TRENDS

Sugarcane Juice Preservation and Bottling Plant. Business Ideas of Profitable Food Beverage Manufacturing & Processing. Sugarcane juice is not only like any other sweet juice but it has many other nutrients. Sugarcane juice is extracted from the cane by pressing it through iron rollers. It is nutritious and refreshing. It contains about 15 % natural sugar and is rich in organic salts and vitamins. The juice can also be used for drinking or sweetening. In hot summer days, it is a cooling drink. A little lime juice may be mixed in the juice to improve its flavour. Sugarcane juice is used as a delicious drink in both urban and rural areas in many countries. Sugarcane juice is highly nutritious and thirst quenching drink. The preservation of raw sugarcane juice is very difficult because it turns brown soon after extraction and gets spoiled due to fermentation within hours. The total production of sugarcane in India is about 271 million tonnes. It is grown mainly for producing sweeteners such as sugar, jaggery andkhandasari. A small portion of sugarcane is also utilized for other pur-poses. Sugarcane juice is available almost throughout the country. Nutritional value of Sugarcane: The juice Sugarcane per serving (28.35 grams) contain Energy-111.13 k J (26.56 kcal), Carbohydrates-27.51 g, Protein-0.27 g, Calcium11.23 mg (1%), Iron 0.37 mg (3%), Potassium41.96 mg (1%), Sodium17.01 mg (1%). Market Outlook India, the second largest producer of sugar after Brazil accounts for 16 percent of world production. Largest sugarcane producing state of India is Uttar Pradesh, which has 38.61% share in overall sugarcane production. The second and third largest states are Maharashtra and Karnataka. Other main sugarcane producing states of India include Bihar, Assam, Haryana, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Sugar cane is the important karif crop which is cultivated in India . India is also the 2nd largest producer of sugarcane in the world. Apart from being a 2 largest producer of sugarcane in the world, India is also a leading sugarcane exporter in the last financial year India exported more than 28 Lakh tons of sugarcane. The sugarcane production in Haryana is 93.4 lakh tons. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Sugarcane juice is traditionally sold in India by roadside vendors, often in unhygienic conditions. That’s why a few entrepreneurs have taken the initiative venturing into the marketing of branded sugarcane juice through a chain of franchised outlets. Initial indications are that this model is headed for success. There is great market potential for bottled or tetra-packed sugarcane juice like any other fruit based beverages or soft drink. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: Sugarcane is the basic raw material required. For packaging, business owner can use glass bottles or tetra-pack as per customer’s preference and acceptance in market. Sugarcanes containing 50-55% juice.

Raw materials needed include raw sugarcane, water, spices, flavors and preservatives. Bagasse after the production process should be disposed off quickly since it attracts flies and ferments quickly, leading to foul odor. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Fresh, juicy and fully mature sugarcane, which is free from insect and fungal attack or any other blemish, is taken for extracting the juice. The juice so obtained is clarified and filtered to get a clear solution. Required quantities of permitted preservatives, additives and flavours are added. The process should be carried out under hygienic conditions. The sugarcane juice beverage is stored in 200 m L bottles and crown corked. The bottles and crown cork closures should conform to ISI standards. Typical Process Flow: Sugarcane → Cleaning → Soaking → Washing → Crushing → Filtering → Homogenization → Bottling → Pasteurization → Cooling →Storage Production Capacity Capacity of raw material processing - 2.5 Tons Finished product /day - 1000 Litre of juice Working days - 250 days Plant and Machineries Equipments required include sugarcane juice extractor, bottle filling machine, bottle pasteurizer, boiler, soaking tanks, jet washer, etc. STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries. The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry. The act brought into force in place of the PFA is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "FSSA") that overrides all other food related laws.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION Introduction An electric vehicle, also called an EV, uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. An electric vehicle charging station, also called EV charging station, electric recharging point, charging point, charge point and electronic charging station (ECS) is an element in an infrastructure that supplies electric energy for the recharging of plug-in electric vehicles—including electric cars, neighbourhood electric Vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Nowadays, energy efficiency is a top priority, boosted by a major concern with climatic changes and by the soaring oil prices in countries that have a large dependency on imported fossil fuels, which leads to the demand of EV charging station in the country. Benefits of E-vehicle Charging Station  Increase in number of charging stations will boost the selling of EV’s as their will be reduced range anxiety.  It is always great for environment.  It will boost direct and indirect employment in country.  Good Opportunity for young entrepreneur to install charging sttsaion in their locality.

EV Charging station Market Analysis In the first phase of Electric Vehicles (EV) rollout plan, the power ministry is targetting 4 billion-plus population cities under the EV policy initiative. It plans to cover all the state capitals, union territories, major highways and key cities under the second phase. The electric vehicle charging infrastructure market in India is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of over 40% during the forecast period 2019-2025. Increasing government support is one of the major factors driving the electric vehicle charging infrastructure market in India. Based on component, the electric vehicle charging infrastructure market in India is segmented into hardware and software & services. Hardware comprises sockets, cables, and charging units. Software & services include installation and maintenance of charging units, platform as a service, and other services. Other services include battery delivery service and towing service, which are in a very nascent stage in India. Working of EV Charging station The electric vehicle charging station is composed of several electrical vehicle charging machines, each electric vehicle charging machine is composed of transformer, capacitor, control unit having a good quality processor with inbuilt memory for software to operate the station. The charging station has a charging cord and plug which connects to the vehicle via an appropriate plug, it is designed with stand dimensions to fit the charging port of the vehicle. The electrical power received from grid is transferred to an electrical vehicle charging machine via an appropriate distribution and control panel which essentially has various safety and fail safe devices required to handle appropriate electric load. The electrical power is supplied to electric vehicle charging machine which utilizes its transformer set to vary the input AC voltage to required value, this value is decided based on level of charging selected by the user.

Level 1 Charging option provides 110-120V AC alternating current at charger point, Level 2 Charging option provides 220 to 240V AC at charging point, while Level 3 charging requires 3 phase input AC supply which is then passed through transformer and then rectifier, followed by the ripple factor reducing circuit so as to obtain the DC power supply which is supplied to charging point. The various interface and control actions are governed by the control system as per the software feed in the machine based on which its classified into smart or dumb charging machine. The processor present in the control unit processes the data algorithm built in the software as per which the input are requested from the user, based on these input charging of vehicle takes place. EV batteries charging system This charging system is an AC-DC power circuit that must be controlled in order to respect the vehicles’ batteries nominal characteristics to preserve their lifespan. Additionally, it should monitor the batteries during their operation to prevent damages during the charging or discharging processes. The ACDC power circuit can be implemented with different topologies according to the characteristics desired for the system.

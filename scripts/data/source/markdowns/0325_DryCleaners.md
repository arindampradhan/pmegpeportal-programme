DRY CLEANERS AND LAUNDRY INTRODUCTION: Dry cleaning is any cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent other than water. The modern dry-cleaning process was developed and patented by Thomas L. Jennings. Despite its name, dry cleaning is not a "dry" process; clothes are soaked in a liquid solvent. Tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), which the industry calls "perc", is the most widely used solvent. Alternative solvents are trichloroethane and petroleum spirits. Most natural fibres can be washed in water but some synthetics (e.g. viscose, lyocell, modal, and cupro) react poorly with water and must be dry-cleaned.

MARKET DEMAND: The dry-cleaning and laundry services market expected to reach a value of nearly $181.4 billion by 2022, significantly growing at a CAGR of 11.1% during the forecast period. The growth in the dry-cleaning and laundry services market is due to increasing disposable income. However, the market for dry-cleaning and laundry services is expected to face certain restraints from several factors such as excessive market competition. BASIS AND PRESUMPTION: 1.300 working days have been considered per annum. 2. Minimum labour wages have been considered. 3.11% rate of interest has been taken into account. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: Preparation of project profile Availability of finance 2 months Selection of site 1 month Machinery installation and procurement of Raw material 1 month Recruitment of staff and trial run 1 month 6 months ENERGY CONSERVATION: Required Electricity shall be provided by the Electricity Department and D. G set may be used for the accomplishment of the project. The workers must be aware of unnecessary utilization of electricity. ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION: This unit is no way linked with serious pollution hazards. However, the authority should provide gloves to handle chemicals and should maintain good working environment.

INFRASTRUCTURE: Traditionally, the cleaning process was carried out at centralized factories. Small, local cleaners' shops received garments from customers, sent them to the factory, and then had them returned to the shop for collection by the customer. This cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process, and the second to remove the solvent from the garments. Machines of this era were described as vented; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere, the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts. This not only contributed to environmental contamination but also much potentially reusable PCE was lost to the atmosphere. Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry-cleaning machines in the Western world are now fully enclosed, and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere. In enclosed machines, solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled, so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of. The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor, which automatically senses when all detectable traces of PCE have been removed. This system ensures that only small amounts of PCE fumes are released at the end of the cycle. PROCESS: A dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine and clothes dryer. Garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber (referred to as the 'basket' or 'drum'), which constitutes the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the garment load. The basket capacity is between about 10 and 40 kg (22 to 88 lb). During the wash cycle, the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it. During the wash cycle, the solvent in the chamber (commonly known as the 'cage' or 'tackle box') is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage'. This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit consisting of a boiler and condenser. The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank. The ideal flow rate is roughly 8 litres of solvent per kilogram of garments per minute, depending on the size of the machine.

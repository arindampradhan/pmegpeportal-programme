Thread 3. Packaging Material Machinery Requirement: Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Sewing Machine 10 250000 2. Band saw Machine 2 300000 3. Light Duty Hot Press 10 50000 4. Counting & Packaging Machine 5 500000 Total Amount 1100000 Manufacturing Process: The cotton fabric rolls are unrolled and folded so as to have the dimension of bag plus straps followed by which band saw machine is used to cut the straps out of folded fabric and simultaneously the fabric also gets cut into the size of the bags. These cut section of bag and straps are taken to sewing area where the straps section is folded and sewed to obtain straps and simultaneously on other sewing machine the bag sections

are stitched together followed by which both the straps and bag are stitched together in order to obtain the Cotton bag. These bags are appropriately placed in a light duty hot press which presses the bags into proper shape, removing any wrinkles, followed by which these bags are placed in counting and packaging machine which counts the number of bags and after a fixed number of packages them together. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil Work cost will be Rs. 4 Lacs (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales Machine person.

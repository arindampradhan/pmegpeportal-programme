PRESSED COMPONENTS (Stainless steel plates, Glass and spoon items) Introduction: Stainless steel offers industry-leading durability — simply put, the material is strong and holds its shape. It is highly resistant to impact and structural damage, and the rigidity of the steel is preserved with a broad temperature range (up to roughly 1400 degree Fahrenheit, at the top end). If you purchase stainless steel, you can count on it to last for a very long time. Replacements are generally not necessary (assuming adequate maintenance), except where the business requires new equipment for additional functionality. Stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, whether rust-based or otherwise. As such, stainless steel is perfectly suitable for a wide range of environments — it’s worth noting, however, that despite being corrosion- resistant, there are still certain chemical environments that may pose a problem for stainless steel equipment. Unlike other popular materials, such as wood, grooved plastic, and various metal alloys (like aluminum), stainless steel retains a smooth and even surface quite easily. So long as you properly maintain the steel, there will be very few dips, crevices, and grooves that form in the steel. Market Potential: Stainless-Steel Cooking Utensils. Stainless-steel cooking utensils are designed with a blend of strength and beauty. The durable metal

holds up to heat, cold and multiple uses, yet it has a shine that continues to glow impressively even over time. Stainless steel equipment is fairly common place, so you’re most likely not going to run into issues with finding vendors with the requisite stainless steel equipment on sale. If you can’t think of any reasons to go for an alternative material, it may be worth purchasing stainless steel equipment as the ―default choice, assuming that you have sufficient capital. India is the second largest steel producer in the world and also approaching towards a full quality regime. The global stainless steel market size was valued at USD 93.69 billion in 2018 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.2% from 2019 to 2025. Rising demand from end-use industries such as automotive, oil and gas, and construction is anticipated to propel the growth.

Manufacturing Process: The process of manufacture comprises of the following operations –  Sheets of finally required gauge are obtained from cold rolling mills or from the traders.  These sheets are cut into the shapes of square blank of circles.  These circles blank sheets are annealed before sending them for further processing.  Feeding circles to press / spinning.  Pressing different items.  Spinning operation for different items. Surface finishing.  Storing & dispatch. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 5 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Machine Operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

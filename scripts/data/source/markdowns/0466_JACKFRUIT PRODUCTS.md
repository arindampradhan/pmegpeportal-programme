A. INTRODUCTION: The Jackfruit, botanically known as Artocarpus heterophyllus lam, is one of the popular fruits of India and is believed to be indigenous to our country. It is grown extensively in the West Coast, Assam, West Bengal, Orissa and Bihar. The name jack is said to be an adoption of Portugese ‘Jaca’ which in turn is believed to have originated from Malayalam name of the fruit, ‘Chakka’. Among the other Indian names of the fruit are: Panasa (Sanskrit and Telgu), Kathal (Hindi), Phanas (Marathi), Pala (Tamil), Halasu (Kannada) Fully ripe jackfruit is sweet and has an exotic flavour. The bulbs (edible flakes) contain 7.5% sugar on dry weight basis and a fair amount of Carotene (Vitamin A). The seeds are rich in Carbohydrates and also a good source of Vitamins. Ripe fruits are utilized in the preparation of canned fruits, nectar and jams. Unripe fruits are also used for culinary preparations like chips, pickels etc. B. PLANT CAPACITY PER ANNUM: The unit has a capacity of 1.5 lakh jackfruit cans per year C. MARKET & DEMAND ASPECTS There is a prospective market for these products in India as well as outside the country. It is also learnt that there is a good export market potential for these items especially in Middle East countries. In view of the above, it is envisaged that there is good scope for setting up jackfruit processing units in jack growing areas. This will not only help the farmers to utilize the perishable raw material but also generate more employment opportunities in rural areas. There are about twenty to twenty five units engaged in un-organized sector manufacturing jack chips and jackfruits preserve. 2

These bulbs are canned with a small quantity of citric acid as the p H value of this fruit is very high. The quality standards followed is as per FPO 1955 and PFA Act, 1954. Canning technology can be sourced from Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. F. BASIS AND PRESUMPTION: The selection of the project is subject to the availability of surplus quantity of crisp jackfruit from nearby area. This unit may work 6-8 months in a year and in the remaining months, other seasonal fruits such as pineapple, Guava etc can be canned. 1. The project is based on double shift and 250 working days in a year. 2. The capacity utilization of the project is considered to be 70%. 3. Depreciation of 5% and 10% considered for Building & Machinery respectively. 4. The cost of machinery, raw material, finished products, labour Charges and other input have been taken on the basis of local prevailing market. 3

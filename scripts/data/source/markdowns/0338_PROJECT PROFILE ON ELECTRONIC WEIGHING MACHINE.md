# 0338 Project Profile On Electronic Weighing Machine

## Page 1

- PROJECT PROFILE ON ELECTRONIC WEIGHING MACHINE Introduction : Electronic Weighing machine is a very useful device which directly gives the weight of the article. The stiffness of the spring determines the range in which the weighing machine has to operate. For example of the stiffness of the spring is more then light weight can produce considerable deflection of the meter while low stiffness springs can be used for weighing higher range of weights. 1 Name of the Product : ELECTRONIC WEIGHING MACHINE 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft RENTED 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 60,000.00 Standard Weight for calibration (1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200 and 500 gm) one set, Standard weight for Calibration (1Kg., 2Kg.,5Kg.,10Kg.,20Kg.,50Kg., and 100 Kg.,) one set, Multimete, Soldering Iron, Portable Drill Machine, Hand Drill Machine, Test Bench and Tools (Nose pilers, Side Cutter, Screw driver, Spanner set etc.), Hand Tools/Jigs/Fixtures, Office Equipment & Furniture & Work Table etc. Total Capital Expenditure Rs. 60,000.00 b Working Capital Rs. 225,000.00 TOTAL PROJECT COST : Rs. 285,000.00 3 Estimated Annual Production Capacity: (Rs. in 000) Sr. No. Particulars Capacity in No./Q.

ISABGOL PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: As most people know, psyllium is a herbesious plant. Isabgol, ispaghula, or isabgula are other names for it. Psyllium husk and psyllium powder are both made from this herb. Because the seeds of the ispaghula husk are indigestible, they provide soluble fiber. In the production and export of psyllium husk powder, India dominates the global market. On the global market, it accounts for about 80% of psyllium husk powder. Due to a number of factors, India has the upper hand in the isabgol game. Isabgol has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years. Sweet, astringent, cooling, emollient, mucilaginous, diuretic, laxative, anti-inflammatory, antidysentic, expectorant, aphrodisiac, roborant, and tonic are some of the properties of the seeds. Stomach disorders, tri dosha, burning sensations, habitual constipation, strangury, gastritis, chronic diarrhoea, dysentery, and colonalgia are some of the most common conditions treated with Isabgol husk. Furthermore, it is now used in the food industry to make ice cream, candy, and other confections. Uses & Market Potential: Isabgol is one of the most important medicinal plants cultivated for its husk. Mucilage yields are about 25% or more of the total seed yield (by weight). Mucilage of Isabgol seed is often called Psyllium Husk. India ranks first in Isabgol production (98%) and the only international supplier of seed and husk. Isabgol is the leading foreign exchange producer of the country among medicinal plants (Rs.30 million dollars). It contains a

SPARK PLUG MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The ignition system for petrol-driven engines is external i.e. during the compression stroke of the engine, electrical spark is used to trigger the combustion of compressed air-fuel mixture. This electrical spark is produced using spark plug. In simple words, spark plug is the device responsible to initiate combustion process in petrol engine. Typically, the spark plugs are positioned toward the top of the cylinder head. The housing (having multiple components), insulator, and electrodes are the three primary components of a spark plug. Terminal connects with the ignition system with the help of high tension cord and its function is to conduct voltage to the central electrode. Insulator is used for flashover protection and to insulate the central shaft, terminal, and center electrode from high voltage i.e. it is used to prevent escape of high voltage before it gets to the electrode tip. Resistor suppresses the ignition noise that occurs during the sparking process, aids in the prevention of electrical interference with other electrical components in the vehicle, as well as radio reception interruption.

Uses & Market Potential: According to a recent market research study, the worldwide spark plug market is expected to reach USD 6.5 billion by the end of 2025, growing at a CAGR of 5% over the projected period. The worldwide spark plug market is expected to increase as the automobile sector expands. The growing demand for automobiles all over the world is the primary reason driving the spark plug market's rise. The government's increased rigorous norms in terms of pollution and fuel efficiency regulations is also a key driver in the growth of the spark plug industry. The Covid 19 epidemic has thrown a wrench in the market, causing delays in the supply chain, demand, and device manufacture. The financial businesses and financial markets have suffered as a result of the shutdown. The worldwide spark plug market is divided into two types based on product type: hot and cold spark. The market is divided into platinum, copper, and iridium spark plugs based on the materials used. The market is divided into OME and aftermarket segments based on the sales channel. The market is divided into four categories based on application: maritime, industrial, automotive, and others. Product: Spark Plug Raw Material: The raw materials are mentioned below:  Steel  Aluminum oxide ceramic  Nickle copper alloys  Nickle alloy steel

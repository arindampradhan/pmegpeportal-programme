ALUMINIUM FOIL CONTAINER Introduction: Aluminium foil containers are widely used in food packaging due to its number of advantages. It is impervious to moisture, light, bacteria, and all gases. Because of its ability to block out bacteria and moisture especially, it helps the food last longer than if it were wrapped in plastic. The ease of packaging and sealing of food with aluminum foil is what makes it the most ideal household and food industry item. Aluminum foil has good thermal stability. Apart from this, it is it can recycle efficiently, protect the environment, and save resources. This product is light-weight and meets national food hygiene standards. This project is based on containers with capacity of 450 ml. Uses & Market Potential: The growth of the aluminum foil packaging market is influenced by the growth in the pharmaceutical industry and the increase in demand from the cosmetic industry. Aluminum foil is used for packaging applications in the personal care and cosmetic industries. This

provides protection to the products internally and enhances the appearance of the packaging. The growing demand for cost-effective, light-weight, and single-serve packaging solutions is likely to propel the growth of the aluminium foil containers market. The aluminum foil packaging market is undergoing various changes such as availability in various forms, acceleration of technological innovation, and shifts in competitive power, and with the evolving customer expectations. The global aluminum foil packaging market is expected to grow with 4.5 % CAGR during the forecast period to 2023. Raw Material: 1. Aluminum Foil rolls 2. Packing Material Manufacturing Process:

At first, the aluminium foil rolls of desired quality (required micron thickness) will be procured from the local vendor. The die of the desired shape and size of the container is mounted on the hydraulic paper plate punching machineafter the approval from the production department. After mounting of the die, aluminium foil is fed into the punching machine. There are arrangements of successive rolls in this machine that allow the continuous feed of aluminium foil. There is an arrangement of hydraulic operated punch in the machine which imparts sufficient force for the aluminium foil punching. The foil will take the desired shape of the die. The compressed air is blown over the die for removal of the container from the die. For quality enhancement before starting the continuous production, the first three-four pieces of aluminium container are analyzed to satisfy the client requirement. Once the container meets the desired criteria continuous feeding of the aluminium foil is done in the machine. The containers produced by the punching process are collected in the bins. The finished containers thus obtained will be packed down in the required quantities for dispatch. Machines & equipments: Major machines and equipments are: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Aluminium Foil Container making machines 1 1850000 2. Other equipments (Dies, bins, pumps,etc.) 50000 Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities,

documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require

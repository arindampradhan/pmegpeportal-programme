The hollow, thin-walled bamboos reed undergoes the following steps to transform as a flute or Bansuri:  Selecting the Bamboo: The inner distance across of the bamboo is estimated with a Vernier Caliper. It's both the length and distance across which at last chooses the nature of sound. More extensive the width and longer the length, bring down the pitch of the sound.  Cutting the Bamboo: The sort of flute and the pitch required chooses the length. The bamboo is then estimated with an estimating tape and slice to measure.  Readying the reed: within the bamboo is completely cleaned and the bunches are eliminated by embeddings a bar of a lesser breadth through it. At that point external body and the inward territories of bamboo are smoothened with sand paper.  Making Holes: A straight line is set apart on the bamboo with a pencil. Normally 7 openings are set apart with a pencil. The openings are then singed into the bamboo utilizing hot metal bars of different measurements.  Fitting The Cork: A stopper of reasonable thickness is fit inside the bamboo with the assistance of a pole. The plug is put simply over the blowing opening to keep air from getting away.  Adjusting the length of Bamboo: To acquire the correct pitch the length of the bamboo is straightened out by cutting additional reed. Temperature assumes a crucial part in the pitch of a woodwind. The remainder of the openings are made dependent on this length of the bamboo which decides the proportion that characterizes the situation of each opening.  Tuning The Flute: Although it is true that a flute is not tuned, but it may require a fine sense of pitch and precision. For example if a

particular note sounds lower for instance, that particular hole is widened with a file until it sounds correct. However, it is almost impossible to lower a note if it is higher as the hole cannot be narrowed. One may try to fit a patch in such cases. Finally the flute is then washed to remove dust, saw dust and unwanted particles. The washed and cleaned flute is then stored overnight in a cylindrical container having almond oil and antiseptic ginger oil.

HANDICRAFTED JEWELLERY Introduction: Handmade jewellery (or handmade jewellery) is jewellery which has been assembled and formed by hand rather than through the use of machines. According to the guidelines of the U. S. Federal Trade Commission, in order to be stamped or called "handmade" in United States, the work must be made solely by hand power or hand guidance. This means that jewellery may be made using drills, lathes, or other machinery, but it must be guided by the human hand. "Handmade" is one of the most effective descriptors to help emphasize the quality and uniqueness of a product. Like any other word, though, it comes with baggage and must be used with care. A handicraft, sometimes more precisely expressed as artisanal handicraft or handmade, is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. It is a traditional main sector of craft and applies to a wide range of creative and design activities that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, etc. One of the world's oldest handicraft is Dhokra; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. Usually, the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic. Handicraft industries are those that produce things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality. This project deals in set of jewellery which includes a necklace and two bangles in each set.

Benefits of handcrafted jewellery: There is a certain allure to handmade jewellery. Some say its the uniqueness and individually that its infused with, others say that the allure is due to the hands on expert craftsmanship and passion that goes in to creating it. Here are the top 5 benefits of choosing handmade jewellery for your jewellery collection: 1. Designed and made by an Artisan: When you're looking for jewellery that is both personal and meaningful, look no further. This type of jewellery is crafted by an expert jewellery designer and producer, often inspired by his or her environment or other elements in their life. This adds to the meaningfulness of the piece to both the owner/wearer and designer. 2. Environmentally Friendly: It is generally known that mass-market production of products has various harmful effects on our natural environment and resources. Handmade jewellery is not mass produced, and the methods used to produce it use significantly less energy and other resources; this is much better for our environment and what we pass on to the future generation. 3. Significant Time Commitment to Make Each Piece Timeless: Each handmade jewellery piece requires significant time investment, however, the time invested produces jewellery that is considered by many to be timeless. It would last through all fashion cycles and is perfect to pass from generation to generation in your family. 4. High Quality Jewellery Materials: Since these pieces are made by jewellery artisans a higher quality of jewellery materials are used in the finished product than with mass produced jewellery. It’s often the case with mass produced jewellery that the potential for dirty metal blends are high, as a result designs are modified to conceal this. 5. Prompt Customer‐Friendly Service: Prompt customer-friendly service is a staple of handmade jewellery brands. At Chris Anderson Jewellery we provide the most exceptional customer service to our valued clients. We enjoy receiving testimonials from our customers about how fast their jewellery was shipped and how much they loved engaging with our professional representatives.

Types of Handmade jewellery: However modern we have grown with time, the craze for traditional Indian jewellery has remained the same with its demand increasing manifold in almost all the sections of the society. Following is a list with a brief description of the most widely recognized and admired types of handmade jewellery adorned by women in India:  Antique Jewellery: As the name itself suggests, this kind of jewellery is out of the mainstream production and has lost its popularity in the past decades which makes it called as antique pieces of jewellery. Its significance lies in keeping the old world charm alive as it has an ancient look.  Bead Jewellery: Chiefly related to Indus valley civilization, bead jewellery is a five thousand year old art made popular by the Indus valley people. They created beautiful beads out of gold, copper, silver, clay, ivory and wood. Many excavations done at the site of Indus valley civilization has given its proof by revealing a wide variety of finished and unfinished beads from the place.  Custom Jewellery: Custom jewellery as the name itself suggests is made according to one’s personal requirements. It is basically sought by those whose needs are not fulfilled with the variety available in the market. In customized jewellery, customer gets complete freedom to choose metals, designs and other specifications according to his own taste and needs.  Filigree Jewellery: Silver metal is used as a base for making filigree jewellery. This kind of jewellery requires a lot of patience and an eye for minute details as a lot of technicality and precision is involved in its creation. Designs & styles of handmade jewellery: Necklaces, chokers, earrings, nose rings, finger rings, bracelets, anklets, earrings and ear cuffs are some styles that have a plethora of design options available in the market. Handmade jewellery designers used to create a basket of traditional as well as modish styles that women can choose.

 Styling Tips: Since handmade jewellery can be availed in a variety of types and styles, there are no limits on the type of garments they can be paired with. The look of a handmade cotton saree can be taken to a whole new level with the right kind of beaded handmade necklace and earrings. Since cotton is a formal fabric which is also lighter than silk, handmade jewellery can be used to add a little heaviness to the overall look. Handmade stone jewellery is also another viable option. This jewellery type, especially in gemstones, can be used to glam up an ethnic party wear ensemble such as an anarkali suit or a lehenga choli. While the garment remains the focus of the overall look, this type of jewellery can be used as complementary features that enhance the look as opposed to stealing the limelight. Handmade jewellery in copper, silver and plated gold is ideal for casual or semi-formal Indo-Western attires. A kurti or tunic and dhoti pants ensemble can be complemented by excellent metallic pieces, especially if they have statement elements such as a sizeable stone or pearls. Jewellery Market Analysis: The handicraft jewelry market was valued at $32.9 billion in 2019, and is estimated to reach $ 59.7 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 7.80% from 2020 to 2027. In 2019, the female gender segment accounted for more than half of the share in the total handicraft jewelry market, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.60% throughout the forecast period. Handicraft jewelry is fashion accessory used to compliment an outfit. Raw materials used to produce such type of jewelry is made of less precious materials as compared to precious materials such as gold, diamond, and gems. For instance, glass, plastic, semi-precious stones, beads, leather, aluminum, brass, and others are the raw materials used in the making of costume jewelry. Increase in consumer preference for fashionable and affordable jewelry is expected to foster the growth of the market.

"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" Project Profile on Exhaust fans Introduction : Exhaust fans find a wide variety of use in households and industries. It is also used as a part by equipment manufacturers whose products require higher degrees of forced ventilation ( computers, freezers, automobiles). Therefore there is a good market for the product provided the manufacturer is prepared to design and make fans suitable for a broad spectrum of activity.. RAW MATERIALS Stamping, aluminium casting for body and cover, ball bearings, MS shaft, Super enamelled copper wire, Blade assembly, frame mounting, capacitors, insulation materials, hardware Process of Manufacture:The body casting is machined as per design. The stator core and rotor winding is then carried out and assembled in the casing. The blades/vanes are fixed on the shaft. The unit is tested for performance and quality and packed. Market potential :Exhaust fan has a very good demand in the market. All industrial concerns, hospitals, hotels, educational institutions etc need this product. There is ample potential for setting up of new industrial units in this area.

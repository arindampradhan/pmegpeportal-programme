It breaks up locks and unorganized clumps of fiber and then aligns the individual fibers to be parallel with each other. This process ensures that the fiber strands flow smoothly while spinning. This process is also used to blend different wools.  Spinning- The checked fleece is spun on a Charkha or the turning wheel to create the yarn. The thickness of the yarn relies upon the nature of the floor covering and typically a 3 handle yarn is utilized.  Dyeing / Coloring- The dyeing of wool is a delicate process which varies according to the dyestuff used and the color desired.

The weaver will follow the plan to weave.  Warping: Wrapping is masterminding of the yarn so it runs longwise in weaving. Turned string is utilized for fine and accurate weaves and jute is additionally utilized for harsher examples. In distorting activity, all the twists for the floor covering weaving are brought to the thick iron bar and afterward moved to a meager steel pole.

The final step involves shearing the tops of the looped tufts to create the pile. Hand-tufted rug makers use a tool called a “tufting gun” which holds the yarn to push through the primary backing that is stretched in place on a frame.  Knot: Most hand tailored carpets are woven by tying ties on the twist strands. The two transcendent sorts of bunches are hilter kilter and balanced  Asymmetrical (persian or senneh) tie To frame this bunch, yarn is folded over one twist strand and afterward passed under the adjoining twist strand and brought back to the surface.  Symmetrical (turkish or ghiorde) knot] - The balanced bunch is utilized in Turkey, the Caucasus and Iran by Turkish and Kurdish clans.

At that point the floor covering is being washed completely to clean out the tidies and additional cotton and fleece miniature particles.  Finishing and packaging: Then the carpet is further subjected to inspection for texture and color evenness of design. After they do some manual adjustment it proceeds for packing and shipping.

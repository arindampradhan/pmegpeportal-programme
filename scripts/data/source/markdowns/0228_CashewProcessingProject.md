MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The Raw Cashew Nuts are procured from vendor and stored in in raw material warehouse as per production requirement. The proposed cashew processing unit is a fully automatic plant thus requires minimum manual handling. The Cashew Nuts are fed to Steam Cooker which utilizes steam generated by its steam generator utilizing the furnace of the cooking system. Cooking aids shell removal of cashew. The cooked cashews are not directly further processed, rather they are allowed to remain undisturbed for some time to aid shell removal further, followed by which the cashew is fed to shell cutting machine, which essentially cuts open the shell and extracts the cashew. The output of cashew cutting machine is fed to vibrator separator which separates cashew from husk, followed by which cashew are then taken to a sorting area on conveyor where workers sort and manually remove any remnant of shell using knifes. These Cashews are then fed to oven to reduce the moisture content of cashews and to ultimately dry them to required level, followed by which they are again allowed some holding time in a humidity-controlled chamber to further assist skin removal. The Peeling of cashews is executed by cashew peeling machine which utilizes compressed air for the same. The peeled cashews are fed to a kernel separator which separates out whole, half and broken kernel. These cashews are further graded based on size, separated, passed through metal detector, packaged and sent for sale.

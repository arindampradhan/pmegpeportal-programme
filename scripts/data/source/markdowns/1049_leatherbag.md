LEATHER BAGS MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Leather is commonly used for designer labels and other luxury bags. It is because it can easily be cut, shaped, and designed in many ways. Furthermore, its durability has been tested by time. The beauty it provides is evident in many social events. There is no question that it is one of the most favorite materials by many fashion aficionados. Now women can purchase high-quality designer handbags- with-a-conscience that they can be proud to carry. The only concern about this material is the price. Definitely, it is by far expensive, especially if it comes from exotic animals. Even ordinary leather is not cheap at all. It is because the process of making it is laborious. 2 PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES As long as leather has been used; it has been a vehicle for transporting objects. Originally, there were just simple leather bags. Today there are an infinite number of bag types from the leather handbag, which are most widely used. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS  Bags made from garment-weight leather require the same tools and supplies as garments. Specialized cutting tools, hole-piercing gadgets, rivets, and glues are the mainstay of handbag-making; using them makes the difference between an average bag and a professional- looking one.

 First of all the components are cut from suitable materials. The basic raw material is the finished leather, which is not uniform, irregular in shape and size, variation with grain structure and presence of defects on the surface.  Scissors and rotary cutters can go only so far in cutting heavy skins and hides. However, with the proper tools and techniques, the bags can be finished and shaped differently and beautifully.  The cut components are then skived to the edges for ease of folding and/or stitching.  The edges are then beaded and the zips and other fasteners attached as per the specification.  The outer surface (leather), the inner surface (lining) and the re- enforcement materials if required adhesive and then by stitching.  The linings and thread-ends are trim trimmed and sealed. The surface is cleaned and polished and made ready for packing. 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or processing area, space for power supply utilities, packaging area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small-scale factory setup is 1000-1500 Sq. ft. approximately. Micro, small and medium enterprises are engaged in this work accounting for the total manufacturing units. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs.20000- 30,000 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery Sewing Machine: This machine is used to stitch the fabric and gives appropriate shape.

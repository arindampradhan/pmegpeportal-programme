The raw material for hair gel is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the deionized water, Ethyl alcohol and PVP VA copolymer are mixed in a steel tank in required proportion. The overall composition of the ingredients is shown below; The continuous stirring of the mixture is performed using an agitator for uniform mixing of the components. The tank is heated to a temperature of 50- 60℃ by using steam jacketed kettle. The jacketed kettle, resembles a double

boiler with one container placed inside another, is heated when steam is circulated through the outer container. Inside the interior kettle are blades that revolve to mix the oils as they are heated. At this temperature carrageenanpowder, glycerin, and vegetable oil are added into the mixture. After heating for 20 minutes the first group of ingredients has turned smooth. The steam is released from the outer container of the kettle, and the mixture is allowed to cool. When the mixture temperature reaches the room temperature panthenol, Triethanolamine and flavor are added in required proportion into the mixture and thoroughly mixed. After this, the mixture is transferred into the homogenizer. Now Carbomer is added into the mixture in required percentage and thoroughly stirred into the homogenizer. Continuous stirring is done to avoid any bubble formation into the solution. After 40-45 minutes of continuous stirring gel formation begins. The mixture is allowed to settle down into freezers for gel formation. The gel prepared in the previous step is check for desired specifications. After this, they are filled in the bottles using filling machine. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 - 2000Sqft.

OPERATION THEATRE TABLE Introduction: Operation Theater (OT) Tables are generally made from stainless steel and / or chrome plated sections and fitted with other required accessories OT table requires immense attention towards its designing. To make cleaning more effective and efficient, it is always suggested to make the OT tables easy to clean especially the places like seams and cracks, that propagate bacteria / germs, should not be there to keep bacteria / germ free. Operation theater tables used in the operation theaters of the Hospitals are of various types such as with or without hydraulic attachments for lifting / lowering / tilting etc., with or without ortho attachment, specially used as gynae / labour OT table, etc. Uses & Market Potential: The uses of an operating table depend on its design and specifications. For example, some operating tables are designed to perform a wide range of procedures while others are designed specifically for orthopedic procedures. A patient lies on the operating table during a surgical procedure. The purpose of a surgical table is to keep the patient in place while the surgical team operates, and may move various parts of the body using surgical table accessories for easier access to the surgical site.

procedures are performed on operating tables. These include cardiovascular, gynecology, pediatric, orthopedic, and pediatric surgeries. Because of the variety of procedures and types of surgical tables, weight and height restrictions are set to keep the patient safe during surgery. With the increase in the population no. of new hospitals are coming up in Govt and private sector and also the existing hospitals are upgrading / extending their facilities. This is creating good market potential for OT Tables. Raw materials: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Stainless steel 2. Anti static rubber nylon tread caster 3. Moulded Plastic parts 4. Gear Box 5. Hydraulic pump 50 mm thick 6. Electrically sealed mattress 7. Steel hardware & other misc consumables Machinery Requirements: Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Treadle Guillotine Shearing Machine 48” 1 120000 width 2.

Manufacturing Process: OT Tables are designed to prevent the germs to avoid infection to the patient and staff. Sweeping and curvy designs in OT tables are ideal, as they reduce the amount of seams that comes into the contact with atmosphere, to avoid bacteria to hide. For calculation purposes the OT Table without orthopedic attachments is considered in this project profile. OT table have following parts :- 1. Table Top 2. Base 3. Head & Leg Section 4. Hydraulic Lift & accessories Steps are as follows:  Cutting of sections/sheets  Bending  Drilling  Welding  Grinding  Sub Assembling  Final Assembling  Final Packaging & dispatch Major Head, Base, Top of the Frame, Slide Bars, Locks, Pump Lever etc. are made of stainless steel and standard accessories includes – Foot extension, side support, shoulder support, antistatic rubber pad, anesthetic screen, kidney elevator, leather wristlets, arm support anesthetic foam rubber mattress, arm woods etc. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities,

documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Civil work will cost Rs 5 Lac. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Machine operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require.  NOC from State Pollution Control Board

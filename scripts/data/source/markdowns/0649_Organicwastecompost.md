ORGANIC WASTE COMPOST Introduction Organic Waste Composting is a way to treat solid waste so that microorganisms break down the organic material, helping along the natural process of decay until it can be safely handled, stored and applied to the environment. Organic Composting is a method for treating solid waste in which organic material is broken down by microorganisms in the presence of oxygen to a point where it can be safely stored, handled and applied to the environment. Organic waste Composting is an essential part of reducing household wastes. It can be done inexpensively by every household and produces a product - finished compost or humus - that can benefit the environment as a natural fertilizer for gardening and farming. Organic waste Composting is nature's way of recycling. Composting biodegrades organic waste i.e. food waste, manure, leaves, grass trimmings, paper, wood, feathers, crop residue etc., and turns it into a valuable organic fertilizer. Organic Waste Composting is relatively simple to manage and can be carried out on a wide range of scales in almost any indoor or outdoor environment and in almost any geographic location. It has the potential to manage most of the organic material in the waste stream including restaurant waste, leaves and yard wastes, farm waste, animal manure, animal carcasses, paper products, sewage sludge, wood etc. and can be easily incorporated into any waste management plan.

Why Organic Composting is Important As per Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, if a person is doing business on a large scale & generates 15KG or more waste per day, then under this Government scheme it is necessary for them to setup a machine for Organic Waste Compost for composting of waste generated from the daily activities. Organic Waste Composting Benefits Throughout the country, landfills are filling up, garbage incineration is becoming increasingly unpopular, and our alternatives for waste disposal are becoming increasingly limited. So, where do we go from here? The logical alternative is Composting. Organic Composting provides a means for reducing the amount of waste that would otherwise be disposed of in our landfills. By diverting solid wastes from our landfill sites we help to conserve landfill space and reduce the production of leach ate and methane gas. In addition, an effective composting program can produce high quality soil amendments with a variety of potential uses. Types of waste included in compost 1. Organic food waste 2. Horticulture waste 3. Agriculture waste Description of Organic Waste Compost Machine Bio Mechanical Compost Machine is required for organic waste compost process. Technical specification of the machinery  Inbuilt Shredder  S. S Composting Tank  Oil Tank  Heater  Water tank  Two single phase exhaust

Organic Waste Compost Manufacturing Process  First of all, collect the organic waste.  After that separate the waste according to the specification.  Put the waste into the bio mechanical compost machine.  Mix 10% to 15% leaf or grass in the organic waste.  Start the machine for processing of organic waste compost.  After 1 day collect the manure.  Transportation of goods. Machinery &Equipment’s required: Name Cost Total Value of Machinery 345000 GST @18% 62100 Total 4,07,100  Cost of the machine is exclusive of other transportation cost. Land &Building required: Land required 200 Square Feet (approx.) Approximate rent for the same is 4000 - 5000

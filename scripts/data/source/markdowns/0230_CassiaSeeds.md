1. INTRODUCTION Cassia Seeds grow in many countries all around the world; this includes India, Pakistan, China, and Bangladesh. It mainly grows in the low-lying coastal area, near riverbanks and wastelands as well as uncultivated fields. This plant is also popularly known as Senna Tora and is found in Central America as well. The ultimate goal of seed processing is to obtain the maximum percentage of pure seed with maximum germination potential. The threshed produce is heterogeneous. Processing brings homogeneity in the produce. This homogeneity helps in obtaining uniformity in the field. Seed processing involves cleaning, dehusking, processing, sorting, and segregating before packing and packaging. The Cassia Tora seeds are obtained from the Cassia plant. The seeds are processed and cleaned, to use for any purpose. The seeds are hard in texture. It is sweet, salty, and bitter in flavor. It contains Chrysophanol, Aurantio-Obtusin, and Vitamin A. Seed processing means improving the quality of harvested seed through a series of operations, viz. cleaning, drying, grading, testing, shelling, treating, bagging, and labelling. Seed processing helps for preventive measures of pests and diseases by drying. It maintains seed viability. It helps improve the quality of the seed by removing the unwanted seed. The general processing sequence for complete cleaning of seeds is Receiving, drying, preconditioning, pre- cleaning, cleaning, separation, and upgrading, treating, weighing, bagging, storage or shipping.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Potential uses of the cassia seed are it is a great remedy for conjunctivitis and inflammation when it is used with self-heal Spica Prunellae, It promotes sleep & helps to cool down the body., It lowers hypertension, lessens the swelling, discount and pain of muscles by improving blood circulation, It helps in weight loss. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- Raw material procurement Seed Processing Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Preliminary testing of the facility should be carried out by the facility operator to standardize the equipment performance and correct any deficiencies encountered during the testing. The raw material must also be fresh and should be stored in a well- organized area. After treatment and cooling, the Cassia seed must be placed in new bags. The old bags must be treated or disposed of in a manner that will eliminate pest infestation. Seed Processing 1) Pre-Cleaning: Removal of external materials like trash, stones, clods which are either in larger size or lighter in weight. No pre-cleaning is required for hand-harvested and winnowed seeds. In this process enough trash is removed to permit bulk storage and processing, Seed fed more evenly through downstream equipment, High moisture, green material is removed decreasing time and cost of drying, Removal of the bulk of trash permits finer top screens to be used resulting in precise separations. Instead of manual pre- cleaning, automatic cleaning machines are more efficient. This process is most commonly done by a scalper. Here, the raw seed is first fed into a pre-cleaner. At this stage, largely sized impurities are removed. To obtain quality seed, it is necessary to clean the seed

obtained from the farm to get rid of inert materials, weed seeds, other crop seeds, other variety seeds, damaged and deteriorated seeds. Different kinds of seeds can be separated when they differ in one or more physical characteristics. Physical characteristics normally used to separate seeds are size, shape, length, weight, color, surface texture, affinity to liquids, electrical conductivity, etc. Before the precleaning drying process can be performed. To avoid any negative effect of high moisture drying will be performed. 2) Cleaning: The second stage of cleaning is carried out with air blasts and vibrating screens. It is essentially the same as scalping but more refined. It is performed mostly by one machine known as an air-screen cleaner. Almost all seeds must be cleaned by an air-screen cleaner before specific specifications can be attempted. 3) Sorting and segregating: The partially cleaned seeds are then passed on to a cleaned cum grader; where the undersized materials and the seeds are segregated. The separation is usually done based on the difference in sizes and weights. The cleaned and the seeds of the right size are sent to the indented cylinder where the broken and short seeds are segregated. The graded seeds are then fed into a specific gravity separator. At this stage, light seeds are removed. Sometimes the process moves on to the next stage if adequate impurities are not found. The processes seeds are finally processed. 4) Drying: Before being exported; the seed is treated and sterilized by intense heat to stop germination. 5) Packing: Now, seeds are sorted packed weighed, and stitched in properly sized packets. The bags of treated seed should be stored in a separate warehouse away from the untreated seed lots to avoid re-infestation or cross-contamination. The treated lots should be properly labeled indicating lot number, size (no of bags/quantity), date of treatment, and signature of the operator. Testing Quality Control Manual Inspection The preliminary testing should include evaluation of temperature probes (sensors) for accuracy of reading and sensitivity; evaluation of temperature chart for accuracy of recording at specified time intervals. The operator should conduct one empty trial run and the other loaded with Cassia seed. The data of preliminary testing should be recorded for test treatments to ensure that the facility established will meet the required minimum standards and specifications

3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 3000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1500 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 1000 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Seed Cleaner (Pre Cleaner): This machine is used for the pre-cleaning process of seeds. This machine is used to remove external materials like trash, stones, clods which are either larger or lighter in weight.

 Air Screen Cleaner: This machine is used for the separation of undesirable material and seeds from desirable seeds in an air screen machine are done based on differences in seed size and weight. This removes the light seed and trash which was not removed by the upper air and the screens.  Gravity Seperator: Gravity Separators use a combination of air, vibration & separation based on density difference. It is used wherever the contamination needs to be separated. Gravity separators are counterbalanced & aerodynamically designed.

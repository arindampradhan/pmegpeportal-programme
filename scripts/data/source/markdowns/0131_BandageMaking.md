1. INTRODUCTION There is often a confusion in the use of the terms “Dressings” and “Bandages”. In fact, the term “dressing” refers more correctly to the primary layer of in contact with the wound. A Bandage is a piece of material used to support a medical device such as a Dressing or Splint, or on its own to provide support to or to restrict the movement of a part of the body. When used along with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on the wound and a bandage is used to hold the dressing in place. There are two categories of dressings: Adhesive dressing and Gauze dressing. An Adhesive dressing is a piece of medical plaster that is used in case of injuries that do not require a full-fledged dressing. They are meant for small injuries or wounds. The Gauge dressing are thick cotton pads that are used to cover large wounds. They are held in place by wrapping with a gauze strip (bandage) or a tape. There are three main categories of “Bandages” that are Roller bandage, Tubular bandage, and Triangular bandage. They are all used in different ways for one common intention and that is to either cover wounds or to apply pressure in controlling bleeding and support the strain or the sprain. Roller bandage are long strips of bandages that can further be subdivided into two types: An Elastic roller bandage that is applied to support a strain or a sprain and is wrapped around the joint or limbs many times. It should be applied firmly. Cotton or Linen roller bandages are used to cover gauze dressings. These bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place. Fig.: Cotton and Crepe Roller bandages, respectively

The Tubular bandages are used to dress fingers and toes as these areas are difficult to bandage with the gauze. They can also be used for other parts of the body where there is a lot of movement such as the elbow and knee. Fig.: Image of a Tubular bandage on the ankle The Triangular bandages are made of cotton or disposable paper. They have a variety of uses such as:  When opened up, they make slings to support, elevate, or immobilize upper limbs. This may be necessary for broken bone or sprain or to protect a limb after an operation.  When folded narrowly, a triangular bandage becomes a cold compress that can help reduce swelling.  They are used to apply pressure to a wound to control bleeding. Fig.: A Triangular Bandage

The Cotton Crepe bandage is one of the most common forms of bandages that are used to support a sprain and provide compression to alleviate swelling. They come in two weights of varying requirements of compression. The Medium weight crepe bandage is suitable for use as a dressing retention. Suitable for keeping gauze in place, stemming bleeding, and providing light compression. The Large weight crepe bandage to support strains and sprains in joints and muscles. It also works as a modern compression bandage for knee swelling, ankle swelling, and any other joint injury. The Elastic Adhesive bandage consist of a woven fabric, elastic in the wrap, which has been spread evenly with an adhesive mass containing zinc oxide which does not offset when the bandage in unrolled. This type of bandage can easily accommodate of irregularly contoured areas. Fig.: Elastic Adhesive Bandage 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The uses of the products can be listed as follows: 1. Firstly, a bandage prevents the wounds from getting contaminated by dirt and grime and any kind of microbial infection. 2. Secondly, the bandage supports any part of the body that has been strained or sprained so that the blood flow in that region is control and provides the time required to heal and also acts as a constant cushion.

3. The third use is to provide rest to the injured body part. 4. This helps is restricting the movement of the injured body part so as to heal it quickly. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The key raw material that is required to make the Surgical Bandages is Cotton yarn or Cotton Fabric. Muslin Bandage Rolls are made from unbleached cotton material (mesh size 56 x 60) while the Crepe Bandage is also made from cotton yarn, but the weaving is totally different from the Muslin Bandage Roll. Triangular Bandages are made by cutting a square shaped bleached muslin cloth corner to corner forming two right angled triangles of equal size and shape. Orthopedic bandages are made from Plaster of Paris impregnated gauze material that is made from cotton cloth. There are certain specifications that should be maintained when the cloth for bandage is manufactured or is purchased those are: 1. The width of the cloth must be between 2.5 cm – 15 cm while the length of the cloth must be 3 – 4 m. 2. The bandage cloth needs to be woven in a plain weave with well-formed selvedge and free from weaving defects. The cloth must also be free from any kind of filing, wising, or dressing material. 3. The cloth should be bleached to be free me any microbes. 4. The p H of the cloth must be maintained from 6.5 – 8.5. Besides the cotton yarn or cloth, the other materials that are required include Bleach, Starch, Washing chemicals, Adhesives, Packing materials, and Gummed labels. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The production process for surgical bandages can be written as follows: 1. The first step of the manufacture requires the procurement of the raw material that is “Cotton yarn” from the cotton spinning mills.

2. The cotton yarn is weaved in the form open yarn fabric of desired warp and weft count with the help of either a powerloom or a handloom. This is called the “Grey fabric” and is Non-absorbent. 3. The next step is the Bleaching of the Grey Fabric which is done in boiling kiers and bleaching tubs wherein it becomes white and absorbent. The bandage cloth is also dissolved in Starch solution. 4. The bleached white fabric is dried then by passing lengthwise through a Stenter machine. This machine holds, straightens, and stretches the fabric taut as it gets dried. 5. The fabric is then rolled in the form of rolls of 18 – 20 m or as per requirement and then transferred to the cutting and folding section. 6. The bandage rolls are then passed through the Calendering machine to give a proper rigid shape to the rolls. The bandage cloth is fed into a winding machine to make rolls from the cloth of the desired length. After a sufficient roll (200 – 300 m) has been wound on an aluminum pole of the machine, this large roll is then cut into smaller 3 – 5 m length rolls or whatever is the desired length while the width is maintained in between 1.5 – 3 cm or as desired. 7. After the cutting process is completed, the rolls are charged in an autoclave for sterilization for about 5 – 10 minutes. 8. Thereafter the rolls are collected and packed in dozens for marketing. This method is applicable to any type of bandage only the quality of the cloth and the specifications of the bandage change during the cutting process. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work An area of almost 2, 000 – 3,000 square feet would be required to set up Surgical Bandage Manufacturing plant. This space would be required for raw materials

storage mainly, production, packaging, storage of finished goods, and administrative work. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs. 40,000-50,000 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery The following machineries would be required for the manufacture of the Surgical Bandage: 1. Warping machine which makes the warp by winding the yarn at tension including a cross at both ends of the frame or the mill, until the number of warp yarns required has been wound. Fig.: Warping machine 2. Weaving machine or Power loom/ Air jet loom is required to weave the yarn into bandage rolls. Warp and weft are the concept used in weaving to turn a yarn into fabric. The lengthwise or longitudinal warps are held stationary in tension while transverse weft is drawn through or inserted over and under the warp.

Mild Steel Pressure Kier system to boiling off the impurities that are present in the natural fabrics. This process takes place in a large mild steel pressurized vessel which is loaded 1/3rd with the material to be cleaned. Generally a 1 % caustic soda solution is used to clean the material. The temperature of the Kier is gradually raised to 70 °C with steam until the air in the Kier is completely removed. Then the Kier is closed and the temperature raised to 110°C for 1-3 hrs. Then the washing is done with normal water.

It consists of heated chambers, adjustable to the width of the fabric being treated. Fabric is fed into the heated chamber supported at either selvedge by a series of stenter pins or clamps which support the fabric as it is moved through the drying chambers. Fig.: Stenter machine 6. Steam calendering machine to straighten the fabric. The fabric is moistened by steam before the calendering process is performed. A series of heated rolls in the machine are fed with the moistened textile cloth.

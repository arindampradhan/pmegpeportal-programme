With the increase of population the scope of trade and industry is also increasing. As the bags are an essential commodity for human, so the demand of the product is growing day by day. The demands of the product remain consistent through out the year. So, it is presumed that there is a good scope for starting of such type of industry with a huge export potential. RAW MATERIALS The raw materials required for printed and decorated jute shopping bags are jute fabrics, dye stuff, printing gum, chemicals and auxiliaries, PVC buckle and bamboo sticks, sewing thread, packing materials, label etc. used. All the above raw materials are available locally. MANUFACTURING PROCESS & SOURCE OF TECHNOLOGY The Woven jute fabric is procured from the market and spread on printing table and fixed by requisite auxiliaries/ingredients. Then it is printed by screen as per requisite design and colours. The printed fabric is washed and dried under sun light or through drier. The printed fabric is cut as per required design and sizes of the bag. The cut pieces are stitched by lock stitch machine. Then the PVC buckle or bamboo stick etc. is attached manually. The bags are packed for marketing. BASIS OF PROJECT SELECTION There are good numbers of manufacturers of printed and decorated jute bags situated around Kolkata. Expert craftsmen are available here at a lesser cost in comparison with other metro cities. Basic raw material i.e. jute is available mainly in eastern India like West Bengal and they are easily available in kolkata market. More over ports are available in kolkata which helps export to other countries. PRESUMPTION a) The cost in respect of plant and machinery, raw materials and selling price of finished product are those generally obtained at the time of preparation of project profile and may vary depending upon other various factors. b) The salary and wages of staff and labours has been taken as per present market rate. c) Production utilization capacity is considered initially at 75% of the total capacity. The time period for achieving full envisaged capacity utilization is three years.

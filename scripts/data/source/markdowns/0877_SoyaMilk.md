USE OF PRODUCT & MARKET: With the increasing health consciousness among the general people, the use of soyabean is getting acceptance in the form of textured vegetable protein (popularly known as Soya baadi or Soya nuggets), Soya fortified wheat flour, Soya milk, Tofu and Soya curd etc. Being mainly the country of vegetarians, India has indeed a very great potential for Soya milk, paneer and curd. Experts predict that the Soya food industry will grow 20% annually over the next few years. Machinery Requirement: Basic machineries requirement are as follows: 1. Dry Bean Tank These equipments are class of storage equipments which are specifically designed for dry raw material of small granule composition. 2. Soya bean Transferring Machine This machine is basically used to transfer soya bean to Soaking and washing machine for further process.

3. Soya bean Soaking & Washing Machine Soybean Soaking & Washing Machine use compressed air injection in water to roll the beans, separate bad Soybean and other impurities which float on the water and then are simply discharged with overflow to get the pure soybean. 4. Grinding and Separating Machine Grinding & Separating Machine are used for grinding rice, soybeans and all sorts of beans into soy milk, rice milk and carrot cakes. Many small stores choose the versatile machine for a priority to lower the cost. 5. Okara Transportation Machine

## Page 7

After the soy milk is prepared this equipment is used to store the soy milk. Therefore, they serve as machines for temporary storage and transports the right amount of soy milk to the next device in operation on the basis of device capacity. 8. Sugar Dissolving Machine This machine is used to dissolve sugar in the soy milk in the right quantity and provides taste to the product. 9. Soy milk Twin Filter machine Soy milk Twin Filter Machine removes the main residues from expansion of boiled pulp and whey sugar particles that are too large. 10. Homogenizer

This equipment is used in the production of liquid mixtures in which the said mixture, is forced through a small passage at high velocity. This machine reduces solute globule size to a very small size in order to prevent aggregate formation. 11. Soymilk Plate Heat Exchanger Machine Soy milk Plate Heat Exchanger Equipment is a pasteurization process to improve soy milk's shelf life. Using Soy milk Plate Heat Exchanger Equipment destroys bacteria and improves soy milk's quality. Soy milk Plate Heat Exchanger Equipment is suitable for the production of soy milk (Long Life soy milk) or juice. 12. Soymilk Filling and Sealing Equipment This machine is used to fill the finished product in pouches or cans of different sizes and the product is ready for sale in the market.

weight basis is 10:1 for traditional soya milk. The resulting slurry or purée is brought to a boil in order to improve its taste properties by heat inactivating soybean trypsin inhibitor, improve its flavor, and to sterilize the product. Heating at or near the boiling point is continued for a period of time, 15–20 minutes, followed by the removal of insoluble residues (soya pulp fiber) by filtration. Processing requires the use of an anti-foaming agent or natural defoamer during the boiling step. Bringing filtered soya milk to a boil avoids the problem of foaming. It is generally opaque, white or off-white in color, and approximately the same consistency as cow's milk. Raw soya milk may be sweetened, flavored, and fortified with micronutrients. Once fully processed, soya milk products are typically sold in plastic bottles or plastic-coated cartons, such as tetra packs.

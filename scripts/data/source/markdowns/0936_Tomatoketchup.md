TOMATO KETCHUP PLANT Introduction Ketchup, also known as catsup, ketsup, red sauce, and tomato sauce, is a sauce used as a condiment. Originally, recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, grapes, mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients, but now the unmodified term usually refers to tomato ketchup. Ketchup is a sweet and tangy sauce now typically made from tomatoes, sugar and vinegar, with assorted seasonings and spices. The specific spices and flavours vary, But commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard, and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger. Tomato ketchup is most often used as a condiment to dishes that are usually served hot and may be fried or greasy: French fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, tater tots, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavour may be replicated as an additive flavouring for snacks such as potato chips. In fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small sachets or tubs. Diners tear the side or top and squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets, or peel the foil lid off the tub for dipping. In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the "Dip and Squeeze" packet, which can be opened in either way, giving both options. Some fast food outlets previously dispensed ketchup from hand- operated pumps into paper cups. This method has made a comeback in the first decade of the 21st century, as cost and environmental concerns over the increasing use of individual plastic ketchup tubs were taken into account.

Ingredients The main ingredients of ketchup are tomatoes, sweeteners, vinegar, salt, spices, flavourings, onion, and/or garlic. The types of sweetener used are usually granulated cane sugar or beet sugar. Other sweeteners include dextrose or liquid sugar in the form of corn or glucose syrup. The various brands of ketchup have slightly different formulas, which vary primarily in the amounts of spices or flavorings. Thicker consistencies require a greater ratio of sugar and spices relative to the tomato juice. Occasionally formulas must be slightly adjusted according to variations in the acid and sugar content of tomatoes, which occurs with changes in growing conditions and types of tomatoes. Health Benefit of Tomato Sauce 1. It reduces risk of prostate cancer: Eating tomato sauce two or more times a week reduces a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer by around 20 per cent. 2. It increases sperm count: Lycopene, which gives tomatoes their red colour, could also boost male fertility. 3. It cuts cholesterol: Tests carried out by Finnish scientists found that ketchup could cut low-density lipoprotein, aka ‘bad cholesterol’. 4. It improves your eyesight: As well as being high in vitamin C and low in fat, ketchup contains vitamin A, which is key for a healthy immune system and, perhaps crucially, good vision. 5. It makes actually healthy food bearable to eat: Let’s be honest here - despite the health benefits above, ketchup is also packed with sugar and salt, so it's possibly not the best thing for a serious health kick.

Tomato Ketchup Manufacturing Process  Procurement of tomatoes.  Firstly, washing of tomatoes and then sort the good quality tomatoes.  After that put the chopped tomato into the twin pulper, which separate seeds, skins, and stems from the pulp.  Cooking & add ingredients: Then the pulp is pumped into cooking tanks or kettles and heated to boiling. Foaming may occur if fresh tomato pulp is used, but can be corrected with anti-foaming compounds or compressed air. Precise amounts of sweeteners, vinegar, salt, spices, and flavourings are added to the tomato pulp. Most spices are added early in the cooking process.  Finishing: Once the cooking is complete, the ketchup mixture passes through a finishing machine. Finishers remove excess fibre and particles through screens, creating a smoother consistency.  Removing Air: The ketchup must be de-aerated to prevent discoloration and growth of bacteria. Excess air might also create unattractive air pockets and impede the closure process.  Filling: To prevent contamination, the ketchup passes from the receiving tanks to the filling machines at a temperature not lower than 190°F (88°C). The containers are filled with the ketchup and immediately sealed to retain the freshness of the product .  Cooling  Labelling & Packaging

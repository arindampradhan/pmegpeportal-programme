1 Daliya Manufacturing Unit Introduction Wheat being a cheapest source of calories, it contributes a significant part of protein and carbohydrates needed for the body. By and large there is increasing demand for nutritional and ready to eat breakfast food which is easily digestible and can consume less time. Cracked wheat or daliya is used to make a nutritious dish at breakfast or whenever a light meal is required. It can be made sweet or salty according to taste. The wheat is boiled in a little water and cooked till it becomes soft and the water evaporates. Sugar and milk may be added to the cooked wheat or it can be seasoned with salt, pepper and butter before serving. These commercial daliya machines are popular for continuous crushing and suitable for making daliya. Offered in compact size commercial daliya machines do not require too much space.

2 Technical Process Raw Material Whole wheat grain is the main ingredient for daliya production. However, for value addition, daliya of mix grain, maize, malt Jowar green pea, groundnut etc may be undertaken in order to enhance the nutritional value of the food product. The product shall be marketed in suitable marketable packings. Manufacturing process Wheat is cleaned properly that is washed under running water and subsequently softened in water for 5 to 6 hrs. After germination, it is dried in sun light. The flow of material from the feeding hopper is regulating by means of side handle easily to suit the load. Rotor runs in anti-clockwise direction. The beater pass just beneath the ratchet teeth liner fitted inside the top half of the crushing chamber, leaving a suitable gap between the liner teeth and the tips of the rotating beater. This cuts the material caught between the liner teeth like a sword with a scissors action at a 450/650 RPM. After the required size reduction, the material will pass through the screen fitted inside the lower discharge end of the grinding chamber. No sieving is required, as the appropriate size screen fitted will not allow coarser material to pass through. The air generated in the crushing chamber forces the powder to pass through the screen fitted at the bottom discharge end of the crushing chamber, into a filter attached to the delivery trough below. (When crushing wet-pulpy materials, the balloon should not be use) In addition to wheat daliya production of daliya of mix grain, maize, malt Jowar green pea, groundnut etc may be undertaken in order to enhance the nutritional value of the food product. The product shall be marketed in suitable marketable packings.

3 Pollution control The process of manufacture does not involve any chemical treatment hence no pollution to environment is foreseen. Project particulars The unit propose to start Daliya Manufacturing unit plan to process 456 tons of wheat mix grain,maize,malt Jowar green pea, ground nut etc The Installed Capacity is 456 tons , . The total cost of the project is Rs18.10lacs . The proposed study is to meet the shortfall for Term Loan of Rs.3.80lacs on Plant & Machinery and Rs9.80 lacs on working capital requirements. The borrower’s margin shall be 25% of the project cost. The plant and Machinery include Grinder, Dehuscer, Cleaner, Frying pan, Sieves and packing m/c etc. Basis and Presumption  The unit will operate for 300 days per annum on single shift basis  The unit will achieve optimum capacity utilization of 60% with 10% increase in subsequent years  The salary and wages have been taken at prevailing rates.  The interest rate on term loan has been taken @11.50%  The total demand for power is 20kw  The unit will operate in its own buildings Advantage of the Project 1. Easy availability of Raw Material ie wheat, maize, peanut, maly etc 2. Job opportunity to the local population

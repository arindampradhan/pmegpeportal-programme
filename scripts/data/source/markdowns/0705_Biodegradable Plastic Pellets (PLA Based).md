BIODEGRDABLE PLATSIC PELLETS (PLA BASED) MANUFACTURING 1. INTRODUCTION The term “Biodegradable” refers to anything or substances that can be degraded by the natural forces and micro-organisms and Bio-degradable plastics refer to those plastics that can be decomposed by the micro-organisms and also natural factors such as rain, sunlight, etc. and these plastics broaden the options for waste management treatment options over traditional plastics. The most favorable disposable options for these plastics are the municipal composting areas instead of the landfills. Hence, the biodegradable plastics can make significant contributions to material recovery options, reduction of landfill, and utilization of the natural resources. Fig.: Biodegradable PLA pellets The global production capacity of the biodegradable plastic pellets reached around 5.64 million tons in 2019. Polylactic Acid (PLA) based is probably the most well-known biodegradable plastic but besides that there are about 20 groups of biodegradable plastic polymers. Of these 20 known biodegradable plastic groups, only 3 types are produced commercially and those include (i) Starch blends (ii) PLA; and (iii) Polybutylene based polymers which includes Polybutyl Succinate (PBS) and Polybutylene Adipate

Terephthalate (PBAT) which are both fossil fuel based. In 2012, the two most influential commercial biodegradable and bio-based polymers were the Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Starch-based polymers accounting respectively for about 47 % and 41 % of the total biodegradable polymer consumption. PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a potential and popular polymer material. It is also called “Polylactide” and can be produced by the fermentation of renewable sources such as Corn, Cassava, Potato, and Sugarcane. Other feedstock that have been researched and explored include Cellulosic Materials, Agricultural Byproducts, and even greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide and Methane. But that technology is still under development and agricultural by-products set to remain as the main feedstock for starch blends and PLA in the near future. PLA has excellent properties as compared to aliphatic polyesters such as high mechanical strength, high modulus, biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioabsorbability, transparency, and low toxicity. Because of its excellent properties, PLA has shown potential applications in different sectors such as agricultural films, biomedical devices, packaging, and automotive industries. Although PLA is a bio-degradable polymer, but its complete degradation may take several years. As of 2019, production capacity of PLA was approximately 290 thousand tons. The initial production of the biodegradable polymers started in the Europe, the US, and Japan but the production was soon shifted to different parts of Asia due to the low cost of the raw materials and the convenience of feedstock acquisition. Many companies have emerged in China, India, and Thailand that are financed by the local investors and also companies from the global north. In the recent years, the development of the biodegradable plastics from natural renewable sources such as Crop wastes and Agricultural wastes has received increasing attention. If properly managed, this would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal and, also, it would be economically beneficial. 2. MARKET POTENTIAL The global biodegradable plastics market was valued at USD 3.27 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 16.8 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 15.1 % from 2019 to 2027. The governments across the world are prohibiting the use of single use plastics and this coupled

with the rising awareness among the people regarding the harm that the plastics are doing to the Earth are among the key trends that are fuelling this market. Non-compostable plastics are an issue across the globe now and the best way to deal with it is the manufacture and the use of biodegradable plastics. Biodegradable plastics are formed from the fermentation of sugar or canola oil to produce Polylactic acid (PLA) or Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) which in turn converted into biodegradable plastics. The market can be segmented on the basis of Material, End-Use, and Regional Outlook. On the basis of the Material, there can be the following types: Starch-based, PLA-based, Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT), Polybutylene Succinate (PBS), Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), and others. Among these types, the Starch-based bags are set to dominate the market. The segment is poised to expand at a revenue-based CAGR of 10.4% during the same period in terms of revenue. The PLA-based plastics on the other hand are also another popular category and this is mainly due to the low-cost of the products. On the basis of End-Use the areas include: Packaging, Industrial sector, Agricultural sector, and others. Among them, the packaging sector dominates the market as Biodegradable plastics are used in both flexible and rigid packaging. Replacement of conventional plastics by these products in food packaging such as boxes, wraps, cups, and plates is gaining momentum, which is supporting the growth of the biodegradable plastic market. In the agricultural sector, the use of Biodegradable Mulch Film ensures conservation of water in the soil, suppresses weed growth, and soil temperature maintenance in order to facilitate faster crop development. As far the regional outlook is considered, the market can be divided into North-America, Europe, Asia-Pacific region, and the rest of the world. Among the above regions, the highest market share in the biodegradable plastics market is hold by Europe since 2019. In the Asia- Pacific region as well, the market is expected to emerge as the fastest growing market. 3. INDUSTRIAL SCENERIO The major names in the biodegradable plastics market are: BASF SE, Nature Works LLC, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Carbion, and Biome Technologies plc. On the global scale, the American company Nature Works leads the PLA sector, operating a

manufacturing facility in Midwestern state of Nebraska with a production capacity of 150,000 tons. They use crops that grow within 50 miles of their US production capacity. Total Corbion PLA operates the world’s second largest PLA plant in Rayong, Thailand. The plant was opened in 2019, with an annual capacity of 75,000 tonnes, using non-Ithe company announced, the company announced its plan for a second PLA plant based in Grandpuits, France,with an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes. The remaining major PLA producers are mainly from China and most of the companies are small scale companies with a fairly small production capacity of 10, 000 – 50, 000 tons per year. Jiangsu Yunyoucheng operates the largest PLA plant in China, with an annual capacity of 50,000 tonnes. In India too, there is a high demand for bio-degradable plastics and our country has a huge amount of bio-mass required for their production. Quite a few manufacturing firms like Envigreen, Ecolife, Plastobags, Earthsoul India and Truegreen have come up with different forms of bioplastics, which are already supplying these environment friendly forms of plastics in regional markets. Truegreen is a firm based out of Ahmedabad that started the manufacturing plant with a production capacity of 5000 MT per year. Ecolife is a firm based out of Chennai that manufactures Bio-plastics for industrial purposes. Bengaluru based firm Envigreen which is the latest startup to enter the Indian bioplastics market has a production capacity of upto 1000 Tons bioplastics per year. 4. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 4.1 PRODUCT USES There are various areas of applications of the PLA plastics pellets: 1. Some of the most common areas of application are the manufacture of plastic films, plastic bottles, plastic bags, etc. 2. Secondly, a lot of biodegradable medical devices are made from the PLA plastic pellets (e.g. screws, pins, rods, and plates that are expected to biodegrade within 6-12 months).

3. PLA constricts under heat and hence suitable for use as a shrink wrap material. 4. The ease with which Polylactic Acid melts allows for some interesting applications in 3D printing. 4.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The raw materials required for the production of PLA pellets are “Crops and Crop resides”. While the direct sources of the sugar and starch such as corn, wheat, rice, etc. are termed as the “First-Generation” raw material, the Crop residues are termed as the “Second-Generation” raw materials. The raw materials are fermented by the bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. amylophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. leichmanni. After the Polylactic acid has been prepared, it is mixed with a number of other substances depending on the purpose of the usage of the pellets. These include: • Plasticizer such as Glycerol, Ethylene Glycol, Polyglycerol, etc. (2 – 30) % • Flexibility agent like Urea, Citric Acid, Polyvinyl Alcohol. (10 – 40) % • Binder such as Stearic acid, glycerol monostearate, montmorillonite, etc. (3 – 13) % • Hydrophobic agent (0.1 – 5) % • Emulsifier (0.1 – 5) % 4.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS There are a number of steps for the formation of PLA which include 1) Direct Condensation Polymerization, 2) Azeotropic Dehydrative Condensation, and 3) polymerization through “lactic acid formation”. Currently, direct condensation and polymerization through lactic acid formation are the most used production techniques: 1. The process begins with the procuring of the raw materials from the agricultural fields. This can be sugarcane, corn, wheat, rice, or any other source of starch. If they are seeds then screened properly and then dried in

the oven. They are then chopped into fine pieces or ground into fine particle in a Hammer mill for a higher surface area and better fermentation process. If they are juicy crops then they are crushed in the Milling machine. 2. The starch/ sugar present in the crops are then converted to simple sugar acids (lactic acid). The starch/ sugar of the crops is first converted to glucose by either Acidic or Enzyme hydrolysis. The glucose formed can either be “Crystallized” or used as the liquid concentrate for the conversion to the Lactic Acid. 3. The next step takes place in the Fermentation Tank. The p H and the temperature of the medium are kept in control. The p H ranges from 5.4 – 6.4, while the temperature ranges from 38 – 42 °C. This is an aerobic “Homofermentative reaction”, so the process takes in the presence of oxygen in fermentation tanks. In this process, 100 g of glucose produced can give rise to 90 g of Lactic Acid. Glycolysis is the first step in this conversion where the glucose is converted into different intermediates and then gets converted to Lactate. Lactic acid is the final product of the hydrolysis of glucose. 4. After the formation of the Lactic acid, the resultant solution is then transferred from the Fermentation tank to the acidifying tank, where the solution is acidified and then it is filtered. The filtrate is then purified. The purification of lactic acid is a difficult process because of the low volatility and the high solubility is water. To overcome these problems, lactic acid is converted to its ester by reacting it with an alcohol to give the “Lactate Ester”. The lactate ester is purified by distillation, and then hydrolyzed to obtain pure lactic acid. 5. Polymerization of the Lactic acid can be done by three steps as mentioned earlier at the start of this section. Out of those steps, Direct Polycondensation is the most opted step to carry out the conversation. 6. The process starts with the conversion of the Lactic acid to Oligo-Lactic Acid at 200 – 250 °C for a period of 6 – 8 hours, the Oligo-Lactic Acid is then converted to Lactide by the cyclization reaction. The lactide formed is purified by distillation and crystallization process to get pure Lactide.

## Page 8

Finally the Lactide is converted to Polylactic acid at 200 – 250 °C after 48 hours and this takes place after being fed to a series of loop and plug-flow reactors. At temperatures above 260 °C, the cyclization reactions starts resulting in the formation of the “Lactide” while at temperatures lower than 200 °C, the amount of water formed is high and this can degrade the quality of the product formed, hence an optimum temperature is very important for the Polycondensation process. The water formed must be continuously removed with the help of a vacuum system. 7. After the formation of the PLA, the remaining volatile components in the medium are separated using the degassing the PLA melt. 8. After the separation, different components are mixed with the PLA melt that includes the plasticizers, binder, flexibility agent, emulsifying agents, and colorants in a static mixer. 9. The mixture is sent through to the Pelletizer to convert the melt into pellets. After they have been pelletized, the PLA pellets are extracted from the pelletizer and then allowed to solidify. They are then sent for the quality check to see if all the properties are okay. They are then filled in plastic bags as per the capacity required, weighed, and stored in the storage area.

8. SWOT ANALYSIS Strengths: On one hand when plastics take somewhere between 20 to 500 years for their degradation, Biodegradable plastics can be degraded by the natural forces within 5 years which is a major advantage over the normal plastics. The issue of Global Warming and rising levels of pollution are also spreading awareness among the people thus motivating them to use the biodegradable variety. Another major advantage of the Biodegradable plastic products manufacturing is the fact that the raw materials are not sourced from petroleum. Weaknesses: Despite several environmental advantages, the Biodegradable plastics have a range of shortcomings too. Segregation of the plastics and the biodegradable plastics is a major drawback as they look very similar. Moreover, they take a long amount of time to get decomposed and some of them even do not degrade under normal conditions and specified conditions are required for their degradation. Some of the biodegradable plastics release greenhouse gases during decomposition, which is counterproductive to the environmental cause, thus restraining the market growth. Opportunities: With the rising awareness among the people regarding the different environmental concerns, the biodegradable plastics are to find a huge market and hence market in the near future. Threats: The major threat to the market is the fact that the PLA products take a lot of time to decompose which might lead ways to other faster degrading materials.

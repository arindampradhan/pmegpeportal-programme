PROJECT PROFILE ON ‘PISTON RING’ INTRODUCTION. Piston ring is one of the most important part of the Deisel/Petrol engines. It is an open- ended ring that fits into a groove on the outer diameter of a piston in a reciprocating engine such as an internal combustion engine or steam engine. The principal function of the piston rings is to form a seal between the combustion chamber and the crankcase of the engine. The goal is to prevent combustion gases from passing into the crankcase and oil from passing into the combustion chamber The three main functions of piston rings in reciprocating engines are: 1. Sealing the combustion/expansion chamber. 2. Supporting heat transfer from the piston to the cylinder wall. 3. Regulating engine oil consumption. During the compression and power strokes, the compression ring seals the combustion gases and prevents blow-by. Although blow-by is not completely eliminated it is kept to an acceptable limit. During the compression and exhaust strokes the cylinder walls are lubricated with oil by throw off from the connecting rod bearings. Excess oil is wiped off by the piston rings. Not only does the oil ring have the responsibility of wiping the excess oil 2

off the cylinder walls, but the job is also shared by all of the rings, leaving a fine layer of oil on the wall to provide lubrication for the following ring. As rings wear, the ability to perform these functions is decreased resulting in oil consumption and blow-by. When this happens it is time for a new set of rings. MARKET POTENTIAL Piston ring is the one of the most replaceable part of the diesel/petrol engines. It has great demand in the replaceable market as well as in new engines market. For the last few years there is noticeable increase in the automobile industry, which is the vast market for it. Piston rings are not only used in the automobile industry but also used in :  Railway Engines  Compressors  Steam Hammers  Cars  Retaining Rings  Pumps  Industrial Applications  Cranes  Gearboxes So, by maintaining quality and using proper marketing techniques there is alwayes a great market of this product. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS The information supplied is based on a standard type of manufacturing activity utilizing conventional techniques of production and optimum level of performance. 65% of the envisaged capacity is taken as efficiency on single working shift. Labour and wages are required as per present circumstances. The cost in respect of land & building, machine & equipment, raw material & selling price of finished product etc are those generally obtained at the time of preparation of project profile and may vary depending upon the location, make and for variety of resons.  The interest on total capital has been assumed @ 10.00% p.a 3

IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE Selection of site & Preparation of bankable project report 3 months Filing of EM part-I with GM, DIC 3 days Submission of project report & sanction of finance from financial institution/ Bank 4 months Procurement of Plant, machinery & equipment 1 month Commissioning and erection of Plant & machinery and trial run 3 months Purchase of raw material & recruitment of labour & staff 1 month Start of commercial production Immediately as soon as above activities completed Immediately after the Enterprises has gone into regular production TECHNICAL ASPECTS MATERIAL The materials used to make Piston Rings are one of the most critical factors in its performance. Listed below is some of today’s common material used in manufacturing of piston rings and metallic seals: Cast iron Cast iron alloyed for piston rings Modular cast iron alloyed for piston rings Bronze Aluminum Bronze Phosphor Bronze Steel Stainless Steels for use in high temperature MANUFACTURING PROCESS Piston rings are generally made up of cast iron. The blanks of cast rings of required size and desired properties are procured from the local foundries. After that blanks are cleaned and get ground. Then the blanks are undergone through various processes like facing, 4

rough diameter, rough bore, finish diameter & finish bore. The rings are generally machined to the required shape by means of turning, a process in which the ring blank, already axially ground, is copy turned on the inside and outside diameters. After a segment equivalent to the free gap is cut from the ring it assumes the free shape that will give it the required radial pressure distribution when fitted into the cylinder.. Piston Ring Coatings After the completion of machining process the following surface treatments for piston rings are principally designed to provide corrosion protection for storage, enhance appearance and improve running. Bronze Coating Ceramic Chrome Plating Chrome Plating Copper Plating Molybdenum Phosphate Coating Plasma Sprayed Coating Tin Coating PRODUCTION CAPACITY Approximately 45,000 set of different sizes per year. QUALITY CONTROL The procured blanks castings should be checked very carefully as per given requirement (size, grade etc). This is the very first step in quality control. The product should be monitored after completion of each stage so that chance of rejection at the end is eliminated. Piston rings should be manufactured as per IS : 5791-1971 & IS: 8422 for IC engines. The entire operation of surface treatment/ coating should be closely controlled. For the inspection process proper callibarated gauges should be used. 5

POLLUTION CONTROL As this unit doesnot comes under heavy polluted industry, although the minimum height of shed may be maintained with exhaust fans for removing decongestion, fumes, dust, etc. and to provide proper ventilation. No Objection Certificate from pollution control board should be taken. POWER CONSUMPTION Power consumption, which is approx. 30H. P LABOUR REQUIREMENT: 4-5 Manpower is required for Piston Ring manufacturing includes: 2 Skilled Labour 2 Unskilled Labour BANK LOAN Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 10.00% DEPRECIATION Depreciation has been calculated as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 APPROVALS & REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyam Registration  NOC from State Pollution Control Board 6

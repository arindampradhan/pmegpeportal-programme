BAMBOO SHOOT PICKLE UNIT Introduction: One popular use of bamboo is the use of young shoots as food. Bamboo shoots are edible when bamboo plants have just come out of the ground. They are low in fat and calories but high in fiber with around 90% water. New shoots with short shelf life have a crisp and sweet taste. And they've got to be sold immediately. The peak time of availability is from June to October. The shoots are typically harvested when they reach a height of 15- 16 cm. Bamboo shoot is eaten either raw or refined because of its exotic flavor and taste. Nutritious and active products, such as vitamins, Amino acids, and antioxidants, such as flavones, phenols, and steroids, are present in bamboo shoots. They are used in pharmaceuticals and food industry. Being a lesser-known food commodity, the processing of bamboo shoots has the potential to be established as a creative and promising entrant. Bamboo shoots are the tender, two-week-old shoots of the bamboo plant harvested until they exceed a height of one foot. They're most often seen canned and ready to eat, but new shoots must be cooked first. Fresh bamboo shoots are divided into two types: those harvested in the spring, which are harder, and those harvested in the winter, which are much more tender and considered a delicacy. The shoots are crisp and tender when picked, similar to asparagus, and although bitter when fresh, they have a moderate, almost grassy taste that is vaguely reminiscent of corn when fried.

All fabrics are available with Mills, Traders, Dealers and Agents throughout the country. Accessories like labels, scords, elastics, buttons, patches etc. are available with dealers of tailoring materials. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The fabric purchased in roll form is spread in layers on the cutting table. Patterns of various parts of the garment made out of card board or plywood or metal are laid on the fabric in such a way that wastage of fabric is minimized. Several layers of fabric are then cut through vertical motorized blade. Garments are stitched in assembly line manner wherein each machine operator completes only a part of the product. The stitching starts on the 1st machine and gets completed at the last stage where the product is inspected for quality defects if any. Garments are then cleaned of loose yarn or dirt and packed in plastic bags as per customer requirements. STATUTORY APPROVALS: The project does not require any specific government approval. Registration with MSME is optional. An Entrepreneur may be required to obtain Shops & Establishment Registration and Professional Tax registration by local Municipal authorities. Registration under Factories Act, Provident Fund Act and ESI provisions would be required depending upon the number of employees, the location, the level of mechanization and the age of the enterprise. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board whereever it is applicable. BACKWARD OR FORWARD INTEGRATION: As the machines used in the project are versatile, the Entrepreneur can also consider manufacture of home furnishing articles like bed sheets, pillow covers, wall hangings etc depending on opportunities in the market he / she is familiar with.

1. INTRODUCTION In a one-of-a-kind process, the tyre is made from the prepared ingredients. This is a labour-intensive process that is aided by the use of cutting-edge technology. A technique of producing tyre inner tubes in which the tube is moulded in two annular sections from working uncured rubber, and the portions are connected, but the tube is stretched to a greater internal diameter and inflated into a mould with the larger internal diameter before the rubber is fully cured. The carcass, bead core, and rubber tread are the three fundamental components of a bicycle tyre. A puncture prevention belt is also included on virtually all Schwalbe tyres. The tire's bead core defines its diameter and ensures that it sits securely on the rim. A wire bundle makes up the majority of a tire's bead core. A hoop of aramid fibres replaces the wire in folding tyres. The carcass, the bead core, and the rubber tread are the three main components of a bicycle tyre. A puncture prevention belt is also included in virtually all Schwalbe tyres. The tire's diameter is determined by the bead core, which also guarantees a tight fit on the rim. A wire bundle often makes up the tire's bead core. The wire is replaced with an aramid fibre hoop in the folding of tyres. The rubber compound of a tire consists of several components: ■ Natural and synthetic rubber ■ Fillers, e.g. carbon black, chalk, silica ■ Softeners, e.g. oils and lubricants

## Page 4

■ Anti-aging agents (aromatic amines) ■ Vulcanizing aids, e.g. sulphur ■ Vulcanization accelerators; e.g. zinc oxide ■ Pigments and dyes Rubber component ranges from 40 to 60 percent, depending on the composition. The filler accounts for 15-30% of the total, with the remaining components accounting for 20-35 percent. The tyre is built entirely from the inside out. Textile elements, steel belts, beads, ply, tread, and other components are all arranged in a tyre-building machine, which guarantees that each item is in its proper place. This produces a green tyre, which seems to be an almost finished product. There is no inner tube between the tyre and the rim on a tubeless tyre. The gap between the tyre and the rim is directly retained by air. The air in a tube-type tyre is held in place by an inflated tube. Tube-type tyres, it turns out, have certain advantages as well. Tubeless tyres are typically seen to be safer since they don't lose air as quickly as tube-style tyres do in the event of a puncture. The depletion of air is gradual. In the event of a puncture caused by a nail or other foreign object, just fill the tyre with air and drive or ride to the nearest puncture repair facility. Punctures may be fixed by simply sealing the leak rather than removing the tyre from the rim. There is also less friction and the tyre tend to keep cooler because there is no tube within the tyre. A tubeless tyre is also simpler to balance since there is less unequal weight in the tyre. 2. PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The bicycle tyre provides excellent suspension, creates longitudinal force for stopping and propulsion, and generates lateral force for balance and turning. Because bicycles travel on bumpy and uneven roads, bicycle tyros play an important role in reducing shock transmission to the front and rear wheels. They're utilized in hand cycles and particularly specialized racing wheelchairs. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT 2.2.1 Natural Rubber 2.2.2 Bead Wire 2.2.3 Cord 2.2.4 Chemicals 2.2.5 Steric

2.2.6 TMT 2.2.7 Titanium 2.2.8 Sulphur 2.2.9 Synthetic Rubber 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS 2.3.1 The mixing of raw ingredients to produce the rubber compound is the first stage in the tyre manufacturing process. Computer control systems can automatically measure out particular quantities of rubber and chemicals for mixing, and they can save multiple formulas. Batches of rubber and chemicals are stirred together in massive mixers that hang like vertical cement mixers.

## Page 6

2.3.2 After that, each mix is remilled with more heat to soften the batch and combine the chemicals. In a third phase, the batch is mixed once more in a mixer, where more chemicals are added to produce the final mix. Heat and friction are given to the batch throughout all three mixing phases to soften the rubber and equally distribute the chemicals. Each batch's chemical makeup is determined by the tyre part: certain rubber formulations are used for the body, while others are utilised for the beads and tread. 2.3.3 After a batch of rubber has been mixed, it is squished into thick sheets using powerful rolling mills. The required components of the tyre are then made from these sheets. The tyre body, for example, is made up of rubber-coated strips of cloth-like fabric. In the tyre body, each strip of rubberized fabric is utilised to create a layer known as a ply. The body of a passenger vehicle tyre can contain up to four plies. 2.3.4 Wire bundles are produced using a wire wrapping machine for tyre beads. After that, the bundles are shaped into rings, which are then coated with rubber. 2.3.5 The rubber for the tyre tread and sidewalls is transferred from the batch mixer to an extruder, which is a different type of processing machine. The batch is combined and heated in the extruder before being pushed out through a die—a shaped orifice—to produce a layer of rubber. The sidewall rubber is rolled and coated with a protective plastic layer. Tread rubber is cut into strips and put into books, which are huge, flat metal containers. 2.3.6 All of the sidewall rubber rolls, tread rubber books, and bead racks are given to a professional assembler at a tire-building machine. A foldable spinning drum keeps the tyre pieces at the middle of the machine. The tyre builder begins by wrapping the rubber-covered fabric plies of the tire's body around the machine drum. The beads are inserted and secured into place with extra tyre body plies put over the beads after the ends of these plies are connected with glue. The assembler then shapes the edges of the tyre plies with special power tools. Finally, the sidewalls and tread extruded rubber layers are bonded into place, and the assembled. Finally, the sidewalls and tread extruded rubber layers are bonded into place, and the finished tire—the green tire—is taken from the tire-building machine. 2.3.7 For the curing process, a green tyre is put within a huge mould. A tyre mould is formed like a gigantic metal clam that opens to reveal a bladder, which is a big, flexible balloon. The green tyre is put over the bladder, which fills with steam and

expands as the clamshell mould closes, shaping the tyre and forcing the blank tread rubber against the raised interior of the mould. Steam warms the green tyre to 280 degrees during the curing process. The amount of time spent in the mould is determined by the tire's intended qualities. 2.3.8 After curing, the tyre is taken from the mould and allowed to cool before being tested. Each tyre is rigorously examined for defects in the tread, sidewall, and inner rubber, such as bubbles or voids. The tyre is then inflated, spun, and placed on a test wheel. Sensors in the test wheel evaluate the tire's balance and whether it runs in a straight path. A contemporary tyre is seldom rejected because of its design and construction. The tyre is transferred to a warehouse for distribution after it has been examined and tested on the test wheel. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500-2000 Sq. Ft. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs. 30000 – 40000 per month.

3.2 Plant & Machinery 3.2.1 Steam Boiler-A steam boiler is a closed vessel, usually constructed of steel, in which water is heated by a source of heat generated by fuel combustion and then used to generate steam. The steam produced can be used in cotton mills, sugar mills, and other industrial processes at low pressure. 3.2.2 Mixer Mill-`A rubber internal mixer is a heavy-duty batch mixer intended for mixing raw rubber with other components in the production of rubber compounds. Rubberinternal mixers are typically made up of a totally enclosed mixing chamber with two rotors.

3.2.3 Rubber Kneader-Two mixing blades move at different speeds towards one other in a W-shaped trough in a kneader mixer. Because each blade pushes the material in the opposite direction, all raw ingredients are thoroughly mixed. 3.2.4 Mixer with Heating Arrangement- It is a combined machine used to mix the components along with heating the mixed substance.

## Page 10

3.2.5 Roller Press- A Roller press machine is used to flattened the rubber mixture to make a surface in a flattened form. 3.2.6 Tyre Building Machine-A Tyre Building Machine (or TBM) is a critical piece of tyre machinery that assembles all of the components of a green tyre, including the tread, sidewall, inner liner, body ply, bead, and cord body. Each cycle is designed to carry out the various activities at the same time, resulting in a balanced construction cycle.

3.2.7 Tyre Curing-The process of applying pressure to a green tyre in a mould is known as curing. This is how it gets its ultimate shape. Heat is used to encourage a chemical reaction between the rubber compounds and other components. 3.2.8 Pre-cured Tread Machine-The "Pre-cured Tread Rubber Retreading Process," also known as "Cold Process Retreading," is a new technology that has been created. This technique eliminates the requirement for a tread matrix at the vulcanizing step since the Pre-cured Tread Rubber already has a tread pattern on it.

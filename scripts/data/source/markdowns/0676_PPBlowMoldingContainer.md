bottles. After the development of PP material in copolymer grades, these bottles are cornering the market for packaging liquids such as detergents, cosmetics, lubricants and dairy products, a market whose scope has opened up a multitude of potential applications PP. At present, cartons, pouches and bottles made of HDPE, PP, PET and PE compete for space on retailers’ shelves. Glass bottles have lost market share and are now holding their own in just a few traditional segments. The blow molding container has a wide applications and the demand of this product is high and will increase in future. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Polypropylene(PP Granules) 2. Colourant Machine Requirement: Major machinery and equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Automatic Blow mould Extruder 1 2500000 2500000 Machine 3 Ltr Mould 3 Ltr Ls 500000 Total Amount 3000000 Manufacturing Process: PP granules are fed in to an automatic extrusion blow molding machine and is subjected to heat and pressure in an extruder. The semi-molten plastic in extruder is passed through the nozzle and air is blown into the mould to force the molten plastic against the sides of the mould. The final product is then cooled before removal from the mould. The article is then trimmed to remove flashes.

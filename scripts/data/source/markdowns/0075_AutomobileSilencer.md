1. INTRODUCTION Automobile sector is the largest industrial sector in India. Automobile sector is largest by production as well as sale. The Internal Combustion Engine is integral part of automobiles. The I. C. engine operated on different cycles defines the strokes in engine. In four stroke engine the strokes are as Intake stroke, Compression stroke, Expansion (Power) stroke and Exhaust stroke. In exhaust stroke the piston moves upwards and squeezing out the gasses that were created during the power stroke. The exhaust gases produce large noise. The exhaust gases are squeezed out through the tube-shaped device called silencer. Automobile Silencer is defined as, a device used to reduce the noise produced by the engine. Silencer is used in automobile vehicles to reduce the noise produced by the exhaust gases of the engine. Automobile silencer is also called as Muffler. The muffler or silencer is engineered as an acoustic device to reduce the loudness of the sound pressure created by the I. C. engine by acoustic quieting. The noise of the burning-hot exhaust gas exiting the engine at high speed is abated by a series of passages and chambers lined with roving fiberglass insulation and resonating chambers harmonically tuned to cause destructive interference, wherein opposite sound waves cancel each other out. An unavoidable side effect of this noise reduction is restriction of the exhaust gas flow, which creates back pressure, which can decrease engine efficiency. Thus, there is required to design and manufacturing of the silencers as per standards of ISO 14163:1998(en) Acoustics — Guidelines for noise control by silencers. Silencers are come in different types as Baffle type muffler Wave cancellation type muffler, Resonance type muffler, Absorber type muffler, combined resonance and

absorber type muffler. Multiple baffle type silencers are preferably used in automobiles. In a multiple baffle silencer, the exhaust gas escapes through holes that are punched in the walls of the silencer tube. This results in muffling the sound via pulse reflection. Automobile Silencer 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1. PRODUCT USES  The automobile silencers are used to reduce noise created by exhaust gases.  Exhaust gases are removed through silencers. 2.2. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT There are different raw materials used to manufacture the automobile silencer. The material selection is based on the application of silencer. Sound absorbing property

is not only the criteria for material selection. Thus, only those materials can be used which can be machined on convectional machines. Generally Ferrous alloys used for manufacturing of automobile silencers. A. Raw material for outer body and inner baffles: -  Aluminized steel Aluminized steel is most commonly used material for manufacturing of silencers. The Aluminium steel can easily available in form of sheets, which can further process on machine. Aluminized steel is hot-dip coated with aluminium silicon alloy. It has the ability to maintain its strength at temperatures up to 677 °C. It also resist oxidation, so than there are less chances of corrosion. Aluminized Steel sheets  Stainless Steel Stainless steel can be used as raw material for silencer manufacturing. It offers good strength as well as high heat dissipation capacity. The stainless steel can also be available in the form of sheets. The stainless steel material can easily machined on traditional machines. The gas welding is easily done on the stainless steel material.

Stainless steel sheet  Other materials There are other materials can also be used as per the application. The material like Chromium, Nickel, Manganese, Titanium and Copper are used alloying with steel. B. Materials for catalytic converters: - Catalytic converters are used in exhaust systems to provide a site for the oxidation and reduction of toxic by-products like NOx, SOx, Carbon monoxide etc. of fuel into less hazardous substances such as carbon dioxide, water vapour, and nitrogen gas. There are ceramic materials used as catalytic convertor. Also there used Fe- Cr alloy which can satisfy desired requirements by the catalytic converters.

Catalytic converter material 2.3. MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Raw material procurement 2. Cutting of sheets in required shapes for outer tube 3. Press working 4. Gas welding 5. Assembling all the components 6. Inspection and dispatch Raw material procurement To ensure complete quality control, all raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Sorting of raw material will be done. In the sorting procedure, the different types of materials or parts will be sorted and separated in proper way. The raw material should keep in clean place. Raw material should keep in rack, so that there can be easily identified the material by worker. Later on it dispatched on assembly line.

Cutting of Sheets The raw material is available in form of sheets. The sheets are to be cut in desired shape of outer tube. There can use traditional sheet metal cutting machine as well as automatic cutting machine. The machine is simple metal shearing machine. Cutting of Sheets for muffler The muffler is made by either the same sheet or there can use other material. This process is also carried out on sheet metal shearing or sheet metal cutting machine. Press Working Press working of sheet metal is done in this process. After the cutting of sheet metal, there is required to give tube sized shape to it. For this process, the press working machine is used. The machine is Hydraulic press or automatic press machine. Gas welding process The mufflers are then gas welded in one half of the silencer, the other half of the silencer with MS tubing's according to the requirement and are gas welded. The gas welding is carried out on an oxy-acetylene gas welding machine. Assembling all the components All the components are assembled as per the design. In some applications the spray painting is also done for reliability of the surface of material. Testing and Dispatch The testing and inspection of automobile silencers is necessary process before dispatch. The testing is done on the basis of compressive strength, wear testing, noise reduction testing as per acoustic norms.

3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 3000-3500 square feet. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs.40000.00 to 50000.00 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery Sheet metal shearing machine To cut the sheet metal in desired shape, there required the sheet metal shearing machine. Sheet metal shearing machines are available in different size and shape. Generally, there required the sheet metal shearing machine of 4 blades, and capacity of 16 SWG with5 HP motor. Sheet metal shearing machine Power press machine The power press machine is used to press the sheet metal in the desired shape. It does general press working process. The power press machine is also available in

different capacity. There can use the power press machine of capacity of 30 tons with 3HP motor. Power press machine Edge folding machine Edge folding machine is used to fold the sharp edges of the sheet metal. After giving desired shape there required the edge folding machine. This machine can available in different size. Edge folding machine

Sheet bending roller The sheet bending roller is used to bend the tubes created by sheet metal. There required to give desired shape of the silencers, thus the tubes are bent in proper way, for that a three-roller bend machine is required. Sheet bending rollers Gas welding kit The joining of sheet metal edges is done by gas welding process. Oxy-acetylene gas welding is most preferably used for gas welding operation. The conventional gas welding kit is required for gas welding. Gas welding kit

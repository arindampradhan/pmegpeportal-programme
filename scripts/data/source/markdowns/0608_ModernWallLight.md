1. INTRODUCTION A wall light is a type of light fixture that is fixed to a wall. Modern fittings are more often called wall lights or wall lamps for similar terms, especially if the light source is wholly covered by glass. It doesn't take up any space on the floor and doesn't have to have a table to sit on. Wall lights can be elegant, rustic, subtle, or bold. Because they've been around so long and can choose ones for any decor from classic revival through medieval, Victorian, or Arts and Crafts to contemporary. They may be not just the oldest type of lighting fixture still in use, but the oldest of all lighting fixtures. 2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Wall lights can add light to a dark corner in any room and help you make the room seem larger. In a corridor, wall lights can add both light and interest without interfering with movement. They can add more light over a breakfast nook or in a reading corner. They can be the bedside lights in a bedroom, freeing up the nightstand, or working where there isn't room for a table beside the bed. They can accent, and provide light for, the table in the entrance hall where we drop our keys and the mail, or for a sideboard or serving table.

The lighting market size is expected to grow by USD 6.29 billion during the coming years. Light is a commodity that ought to be bought at the least conceivable cost, but lighting is a business resource that should be carefully considered for investment with the right design and equipment. The large majority of our impressions of the world get through our eyes, and light is necessary to vision. Light is in this manner the medium through which a greater part of individuals sees the world. Lighting, hence, can affect satisfaction, visibility, task execution, safety, security, sales, aesthetic judgment, mood and atmosphere, and social interaction. PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL ➢ Plastic- ABS, PVC, Ceramic, etc. types of plastic granules can be used to form wall lights cases. ➢ Electrical components- LED strips, Battery, Switch, Resistors, ICs, Diodes, Capacitors, Transformer, Customized circuit board, Connectors, etc. ➢ Others- Solder wire, Solder flux, Solder paste, Screws, etc. MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps: ➢ Raw material procurement ➢ Injection molding process- Plastic molding ➢ PCB assembly ➢ Assembly ➢ Testing

"KVIC- PMEGP" PROJECT PROFILE ON BATTERY WATER Introduction : Water used in Batteries (mainly vehicles) should be free from salts, Chlorine and Iron. These impuritie spoil the electrodes and reduces the battery and hence special water with minimum impurities are required for the purpose, known as Battery water. Now a days D. M. Water is being used in the Batteries. Raw water from Open well/Bore well or Corporation can be used for the purpose. TECHNICAL ASPECT:- Batter water is manufactured by an exchange process which has two vertical cylinders made of FRP/Plastic fitted with stand and water quality testing kit, so a to ensure continues quality check of water being produced. This cylindrical vessel contains Resin, which has power to remove all hardness from water . Water passes from bottom of the first cylinder and comes from the top and again goes into the bottom of second cylinder, which again comes out from top of the second column in purest form, free from all salts. In this process water has to pass only through two cylinders and many times, gravity force is only sufficient for the purpose. If sufficient pressure is not there one may for small pump for water feeding. 1 Name of the Product : BATTERY WATER 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.

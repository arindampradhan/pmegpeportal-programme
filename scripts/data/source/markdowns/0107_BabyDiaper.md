1. INTRODUCTION Baby diapers are safely used every day by parents all over the world. Since these baby diapers were invented in the 1930s, they have constantly improved. Long gone is the days of plastic outer pants, ill-fitting terry cloth inners and constantly wet skin for babies and infants. Today’s disposable diapers are light, compact, very absorbent, prevents leaks and easy to use. • Baby diapers are comfortable to wear due to the softness, lightness and ‘breathability’ of the materials used. • Keep the skin drier and, as a result, healthier. These benefits have been confirmed by independent medical experts in skin and infant health. • Are better at reducing the transmission of infectious diseases as faecal containment is reduced so that there is less risk of the spread of bacteria. The story of the diapers begins more than a century ago, but it became commercially viable in Europe and North America seven decades ago, in the late 1940s. Its evolution was hardly smooth, however, and the huge success it has become was hardly foreseen at the outset. In nine decades of diapers the author Davis Dyer takes a long view of the product, and explains its development in four distinct periods: 1. Product Invention (before the 1930s), when numerous independent inventors sought better solutions to traditional diapering 2. Early Commercialization (1930s-1950s), when private corporations introduced diapers and slowly cultivated the market

3. Rapid Adoption (1960s-1980s), when demand exploded as diapers became affordable and widely available 4. Continuous Improvement (1990s-present), when the leading manufacturers are competing on a global basis to offer consumers a product undergoing constant innovation and improvement. The main duty requirements of diapers are: • The device should be comfortable for the baby • It should be easy to place and remove on the baby • It should have the capacity to absorb urine and semisolid stool • It should be capable of being wrapped without spilling contents on removal • It should be disposable and affordable • It should be of such inert materials as will not affect baby’s delicate skin Types of Baby Diapers ▪ Teen baby diaper, ▪ Boy baby diaper, ▪ Baby napkin, ▪ Big baby diaper, ▪ New-born diaper, ▪ Paper diaper, ▪ Disposable baby diapers, ▪ Girl baby diaper and cotton baby diaper etc... 2. PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Diapers are personal hygiene products engineered to absorb and contain urine and faeces of a baby. They are placed and fastened around baby’s legs and bottom to form a leak proof seal, preventing contamination of baby’s clothes.

Size measurements: ▪ Standard: 360 mm(L.)×105mm (W.)× 16mm (Thickness) Max. 160 pieces/min ▪ Newborn baby: 320 mm(L.) ×105mm (W.)× 15mm (Thickness) Max. 150 pieces/min 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT Most baby diapers are made with the following basic components: 1) Polyethylene or cloth-like film: This is used as the back sheet that prevents the liquids from leaking out of the diaper. The back-sheet can also be given a cloth-like look, by adding a thin polypropylene non-woven sheet to the film, using either the hot melt process or the heat and pressure method. 2) Tissue: A special tissue paper that is different from the regular bathroom tissue and has a higher elasticity and wet strength is another important component of a diaper. The tissue essentially serves as a carrier for the pad (the pad is the absorbent core of the diaper) and helps reduce the pin holes created during the compression process carried out by continuous drum forming systems. 3) Hot Melts: They are used to glue the different components of the diaper, such as the pad and the elastics. They are made of a mixture of resins and oils. The hot melt adhesive is applied in molten form and when it cools down it provides the required bonding force to glue the materials. 4) Hydrophobic Non-woven: It is used as a top sheet for the leg cuffs; it prevents water from passing through. It is made of polypropylene resin without any added surface surfactants. The hydrophobic nonwoven prevents leakage out of diaper. By applying a surfactant to a restricted area, it is possible to make a roll of hydrophobic nonwoven only partially philic. 5) Hydrophilic Non-woven: It is the main top sheet, the top surface that is in contact with the baby's skin. It allows the liquids to flow into the diaper core. The difference between the two non-wovens (philic and phobic) is the surfactant treatment used in the process. 6) Elastics: Used to improve the fit of the diaper, usually made of polyurethane or polyester foam, synthetic rubber or Lycra (also known with the generic name Spandex).

They are used in cuffs, for the waist and the legs; they can also be used as lateral side panels and in tape construction. 7) Lateral Tapes: In premium diapers, Velcro type materials have been used to provide mechanical grip, it is also known as the "hook tape". In lower priced diapers, adhesive tapes made of polypropylene are used. Then there are new versions of elasticized Nonwoven Velcro Tapes. 8) Frontal Tapes: This is used to facilitate multiple repositioning of the lateral tape without tearing the back-sheet; it is made of polypropylene film and attached to the front of the diaper with adhesive. Its use has helped to reduce the thickness of the poly film without the risk of potential tears associated with the opening of the lateral tapes from the back-sheet. 9) Cellulose: Used in the construction of the pad, it gives integrity and absorbing capacity to the diaper. The capacity of normal cellulose pulp is around 10 cc of water per gram of pulp when the diaper is in "free swell". 10) Acquisition and Distribution Layer: Also known with its abbreviation ADL, it is a sub layer used between the top sheet and the absorbent core. Sometimes used in full length but mostly preferred as a patch near the target zone where urine is most likely to be deposited. 11) Sodium Poly-acrylate: Also known as super-absorbent or "SAP" (super absorbent polymer), Kimberly Clark used to call it SAM (super absorbent material). It is typically used in fine granular form (like table salt). It helps improve capacity for better retention in a disposable diaper, allowing the product to be thinner with improved performance and less usage of pine fluff pulp. 12) Top Sheet surface add-on lotions: In order to create novelties for product differentiation, several topical lotions are added to the nonwoven top sheet, among others: Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Petrolatum, Almond Oil, Vitamin D, Oat Extract, Jojoba, etc. There is another trend to use antibacterial lotions (such as tertiary ammonia or silver salt compounds). However, many paediatricians are against its use for obvious reasons.

13) Decorated Films and wetness indicators: For even greater product differentiation, some diapers use decorated films underneath the cloth-like back-sheet. Some use as many as nine inks with all kinds of well-known characters such as Disney, Sesame Street, Soccer teams, etc. Another gimmick they use is a wetness indicator. This is typically used for adult products but some baby diapers also use it. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process of the Diapers is simple and amenable to line production. It consists of continues operation in which the filler paper is ground by a hammer mill to produce a fluffed pulp which is then supported by a tissue paper. Next a non-woven fabric is placed and adhesive is applied to bond the materials. The diaper is cut to the proper dimension, and the fastener and release tapes are attached at designated points. Thus, the process is: Sheets of rolled wood pulp are continuously and automatically fed to the pulp crusher, which crushes the supplied pulp into cotton-like fluff.  The fluffed pulp is then molded into strips.  Two absorbent layers of cotton are placed on two sides of the molded strip.  The entire strip is then cut into required lengths.  The Waterproof polyethylene film is laid on the sides of the absorbent layers.  The entire strip is then wrapped by a non-woven fabric, which holds the individual strip together.  The strip is then processed by hot sealing and embossed with favorite figures.  The diapers, which are still joined together by the train diaper are forwarded by a conveyer and thereafter cut into separate pieces.  Each diaper is then placed into individual bags and arrayed in good order for packing.

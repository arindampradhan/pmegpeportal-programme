CRICKET GLOVES MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Cricket, was largely spread by the British during the days of empire. In India, cricket is one of the most popular sports. The Cricket Batting Gloves are used as safety guards by the players while playing Cricket to save hand from any injury being caused by the cricket ball and these gloves also observes the shock caused by hitting the ball, thus also helping to keep the hand in comfortable condition during the play for a longer period by absorbing the perspiration, etc. Initially, Batting Gloves were manufactured of leather but due to fast-changing technology, new synthetic material has been developed which is suitable, more durable, and cheaper than the leather material. The process of manufacturing the Batting Gloves is the same as for other industrial gloves. The only difference is that for the safety of fingers, pads are used made out of woollen rug or foam attached on the upper side of the gloves. There are three main types of cricket gloves– sausage finger cricket gloves, multi-piece cricket gloves, and a hybrid of the two. The sausage design is the traditional approach preferred by professional players as these provide slightly better protection. The materials used to manufacture cricket gloves are calf leather, sheep leather, and even cotton. Batting cricket gloves come in various sizes such as men size batting gloves, youth size batting gloves, boys size batting gloves, small boys batting gloves.

Less than 165 mm cricket gloves are specifically designed for children and younger players. They are usually smaller in size and have less padding to provide a snug fit. These gloves also tend to be lightweight, making it easy for children to hold them up and swing the bat. Less Than 165 mm cricket gloves can also be used by women and seniors who have smaller hands. 165 mm to 175 mm Cricket Gloves are mid-sized gloves that offer a good level of protection and grip. They are most commonly used by professional cricketers. These gloves usually have a leather palm and backhand with webbing between the thumb and first finger. This gives extra support when catching the ball. Some manufacturers also add additional padding to the knuckles for further protection. 175 mm to 190 mm Cricket Gloves are gloves that fall in the medium-size category. They are slightly bigger than the smaller-sized gloves and provide a good grip and comfort to the player. These gloves work well for players who have a medium- sized hand. The 175 mm to 190 mm cricket gloves can be used by both adults and children alike. They come in different colors and designs so that players can choose the one they like the most. Additionally, these gloves help protect the hands from injuries while playing cricket. Traditional batting gloves do not have finger cuts, whereas modern gloves have finger cuts. Traditional cricket gloves have single full-length finger padding. They are generally filled with cotton because of which they are heavy by nature. Modern batting gloves are more flexible and give advanced protection to the hand. Comfort could be considered as a result of the combination of flexibility, feel, and ventilation. Modern gloves also come in traditional shapes where they are filled with foam and hence they are lighter by nature. Wicket-keeping gloves are used by cricket wicketkeepers during the fielding period of the cricket game. Wicket-keeping gloves assist cricket players in catching and fielding cricket balls hit by a batsman or thrown by a teammate. Inner gloves are used by both cricket batsmen and wicket keepers. Though Inner gloves is a personal preference for cricket batsman, it is mandatory for cricket wicket keepers. Inner gloves will form the first barrier between your hands and your wicket-keeping gloves, offering additional shock absorption, and a more snug fit. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The cricket hands gloves help protect the hands from injuries while playing cricket. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps:

## Page 5

 Raw material procurement  Process of Manufacture  Testing Raw Material Procurement: The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in; a dust-free, neat, and clean environment. Process of Manufacture As per the graded pattern, the components are clicked manually or by clicking the process 1. Fabric Cutting: The fabric parts that will be used for gloves will be cut. Fabrics are required to make a shell, lining, pad, and we will be cut using cutting apparatus. The palm lining of gloves forms the area within the glove that makes contact with the palm. Given that the lining is directly beneath the area that will be used most to catch the cricket ball in wicket keeping, this inner area of the glove must be soft and comfortable to avoid excessive rubbing and chaffing. The material used in palm lining includes cotton and leather. Webbing on wicket-keeping gloves is an area of material joining the index finger and thumb which serves as an additional surface area with which to catch the ball. 2. Printing logo: Pre or post-printing of monogram log etc. is carried out in this process. This depends upon the price of the product agreed upon. 3. Stitching and padding: The stitching for the gloves can be done by glove type. Components are stitched together and padding is attached separately over the post bed machine. For instance, Palm padding in wicket keeping gloves is the key to providing maximum impact protection, limiting the force transferred through gloves to hands in turn providing protection from injury. The padding is also an important factor in making a successful catch, with the shock absorption characteristics helping to slow down the ball and decrease the chance of the cricket ball bouncing out of your hands. The material used in palm padding includes leather and synthetic. Palm padding can have two different types of surface based on the grip type they provide. One is octopus grip type and the other is pimpled grip type. Plastic reinforcements are inserted at the finger sections of the glove. These devices provide added support for the glove and protect the player's fingers from being bent backward accidentally. In wicketkeeper gloves, Finger end caps protect the ends of fingers which are the most common areas for wicket-keepers to incur injuries. The end caps are cylindrical objects, open at one end, designed to fit over the tips of your fingers and built-in to the end of all five

glove fingers. Made from a rubbery material or PVC, finger end caps will absorb the worst of any glancing blows. 4. Fixing of strips: In this process straps, wrist straps buckles and buttons, etc. will be stitched. 5. Finishing: Finishing i.e. excess thread/material or oily matter etc. is removed. After finishing Inspection and signing of Tag with a full description, etc. is done. 6. Packing: Batting gloves shall be kept in pairs, tied together, and packed per the best trade practice or according to the instructions of the purchaser.

## Page 7

Testing Quality control: Gloves shall be inspected for all the requirements of materials, manufacture, and dimensions. A pair shall be considered defective if it fails to satisfy any one or more of the requirements of the specification. Because making a glove requires so much personal attention at each step, there is little need for a manufacturer to maintain a full-blown, quality control department. Each craftsman involved in the process functions as his or her quality control person, and if a defect in a glove becomes apparent, the person who is working on the glove is expected to see that the glove is removed from production. As happens in many areas where a product has undergone almost continuous design changes for years and years, some believe that the older methods and products are better than the new ones. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1,000-1,200 square feet.

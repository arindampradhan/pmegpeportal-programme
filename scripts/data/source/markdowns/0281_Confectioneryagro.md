PROJECT REPORT ON CONFECTIONARY INTRODUCTION: Confectionary products have been in existence from time immemorial. Confectionary products are generally divided into hard candy (sugar cream), lozenges, caramels, toffee, chocolates & sugar coated candies. The development of confectionary industry in linked with the progress of sugar industry and its production fluctuates with the availability of sugar and its price. Confectionary Industry thus comprises an important segment of industrial activity in the food processing industry and has made considerable progress in the country, since Independence. Confectionary is mainly consumed by children as their most favourable edible sweets. It is also distributed on different festivals to the guests like birthday parties, marriage-celebrations, parties, etc. The consumption of these sweets is increasing day by day. To meet this ever growing demand, many units in urban and the semi- urban areas have come up. But there is a still good scope for new small scale units to manufacture quality production to meet the ever growing demand in the country. MARKET: Quality confectionary is of great nutritional value and forms an important part of a balanced diet for all age groups particularly amongst the children Confectionary is

one of the important mass consumption items and has a demand in urban and rural areas. It is estimated that there are at present over 5,000 small and cottage scale units in the country manufacturing a wide range of products. Most of the small scale confectionary units are catering to the semi-urban and the rural markets, whereas large units are marketing their products mostly in the urban areas and export markets. Manufacture of confectionery products is techno-economically feasible in the small scale sector and offers a substantial scope for further development in the small towns, villages and backward areas of the country to provide additional employment and better utilization of the surplus sugar resources available presently in the country to meet the local demands. TARGET: Assuming that the Unit shall operate for single shift of eight hours per day for three hundred days per annum (a) Quantity 66000 Kg. (b) Value Rs. 37,62,000/- PROCESS: These are manufactured by preparing a solution of cane sugar to which invert sugar or glucose syrup or a chemical reagent (doctor), for bringing about partial inversion, is added. The syrup is cooked to a temperature of F, in an open pan or a steam jacketed kettle. In the open fire boiling 310-320 Degree F process, however, a certain amount of caramelisation takes place which imparts characteristic flavour to the product. Alternative process, therefore, consists of cooking the syrup in a steam jacketed kettle to a temperature of 310-320 Degree F in an open pan or a vacuum cooker under suction and cooked under vacuum to F. Vacuum cooking gives a light coloured products and prevents 310-320 Degree F caramelisation. A supersaturated sugar solution with a glass like consistency is obtained. The product is then quickly cooled by spreading on an oiled, water cooled table, plat or cast iron slab. Flavouring and colouring materials are added and the product is thoroughly mixed. It is cut into various shapes by frame cutters worked manually. PROCESS FLOW: Cooking with Mixing of Cane Sugar Cooking sugar Cooling colour and Cutting Packing Sol solution flavour RAW MATERIAL: The requirement at installed capacity and cost of Raw Materials are shown below:

Packing Material 1.75 Total; 25.00 Power: The power is available from the state Electric supply corporation Grid. The annual consumption of power is estimated Rs.72,000/-PA Load (5Kw) Water: The unit need to use very clean water for the process as it is producing food items. The unit will need 5000 liters of clean and soft water. It is available from both ground water sources and public supply. Manpower: Manpower required by the unit including skilled workers is locally available. The requirement and annual costs of manpower at the installed capacity CRITICAL FACTORS FOR THE PROJECT: 1. Markets for sugar confections is highly competitive and price focuses, so one has to assure the market before setting-up the manufacturing unit. 2. The plant preferable to easy accessible by road and in proximity to cities or towns to cater rural and urban market both. 3. Proper selection of raw materials, additives, flavours and machinery is of utmost important to make project sustainable in competitive markets in long run. FINANCIAL ASPECTS:

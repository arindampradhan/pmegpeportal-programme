WHEEL RIM MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Since the 1970s, the production of aluminium alloy wheels has progressed significantly. Casting has surpassed other production processes as a result of improved wheel design. To fulfil the requirements for metal-mould casting qualities, corrosion, and fatigue resistance, alloy wheel material has changed as well. Car wheels alloys currently comprise 7 to 12 percent silicon content, as well as various quantities of magnesium in addition to aluminium. Wheels currently account for around 15% of the average aluminium content in passenger vehicles and light trucks, and while styling has been the primary impetus, weight reduction requirements have led to the development of more sophisticated cast, forged, and fabricated alternatives. These components, on the other hand, provide vital safety duties and must fulfil stringent design, engineering, and craftsmanship requirements. Metal the metal, low-pressure casting, quality control, topping, heat treatment, machining, and painting are all phases in the production of aluminium wheel rims. Self- preparing alloy is the most recent development in this industry. The process begins with the smelting of low-iron primary aluminium ingots in smelting towers. The rim of the wheel supports the tyre in a car, and the form and proportions of the rim should be changed to fit a certain tyre. In this investigation, a disc wheel tyre is used on an automobile wheel rim. Design is a crucial industrial process for defining and specifying product quality. The design and modelling minimises the danger of harm throughout the construction process. The danger of damage during the production process is reduced thanks to the design and modelling. Modeling software was used to create the design for this wheel rim. The model is then imported for analysis when it has been created. The analytical software is used to compute the many forms of force, stresses, torque, and pressures operating on the wheel rim, and it saves time by eliminating the need for a human to do mathematical calculations. The study takes into account two different materials: structural steel and aluminium. Both materials are evaluated and their results are recorded.

Uses & Market Potential: The rim is the cylindrical outside edge of the wheel that holds the tyre in place. The rim's primary role is to support and seal the tyre to the wheel. The rim maintains the air within the tubeless tyre by ensuring appropriate fit between tyre and rim. The cylindrical rings that hold the tyres of a car are known as wheel rims. The rims guarantee that the tyres are properly aligned and that the air pressure in tubeless tyres is maintained. Between 2020 and 2026, the global automotive wheel rims market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4%. Because of growing disposable income levels and changing consumer lifestyles, the automobile sector has grown, and sales of important vehicle components such as vehicle wheel rims are expected to increase dramatically. Vehicle performance is improved by improved functionality provided by wheel rim advancements. In turn, this important element will fuel demand for vehicle wheel rims in the approaching years. However, owing to a lack of knowledge and low disposable income levels, the adoption of automobile wheel rims has been reported to be fairly limited in lower and middle-income nations, which may hinder the market's growth. Global Automotive Wheel Rims Market is anticipated to register a CAGR of 4% between 2020 and 2026. Product: WHEEL RIM Raw Material: Aluminum Metal Sheet

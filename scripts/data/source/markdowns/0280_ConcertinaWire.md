CONCERTINA WIRE Introduction: Concertina wire or Dannert wire is a type of barbed wire or razor wire that is formed in large coils which can be expanded like a concertina (a small handheld bellows-type instrument in the same family as the accordion). In conjunction with plain barbed wire (and/or razor wire/tape) and steel pickets, it is most often used to form military-style wire obstacles. Concertina wire packs flat for ease of transport and can then be deployed as an obstacle much more quickly than ordinary barbed wire, since the flattened coil of wire can easily be stretched out, forming an instant obstacle that will at least slow enemy passage. Several such coils with a few stakes to secure them in place are just as effective as an ordinary barbed wire fence, which must be built by driving stakes and running multiple wires between them. Uses & Market Potential: Concertina wire is an essential item to safeguard houses, gardens, forests, nurseries and specified prohibited areas pertaining to the defense establishment, aerodromes, railways, warehouses and other Govt. and Private properties. They are essential items to make and safeguard international boundaries. Also, these are the cheapest materials to use for these various purposes. Growing population, increasing numbers of building and construction, increasing the security issues in the current

socioeconomic zone, are the major factors of the increasing demand for barbed wire. The potential of this industry is increasing day by day. The demand for concertina wire depends mainly on the performance of its end- user (i.e. the construction sector). Therefore, the demand for the products under consideration is a derived demand, which depends directly on the performance of its major end – user. Raw material Sources: Concertina wire (coil) is made by Galvanized Iron wire and GI Strip. It has a beautiful crossing outlook and it is suitable for uses after extending, making an ideal security fencing with great anti-climb and anti-cutting property. 1. GI Strip: Cost Rs. 54 per Kg 2. GI Wire: Cost Rs. 43 per Kg Machinery Requirements: Following Plant & machinery equipment’s are required for concertina wire manufacturing machine: 1. Heavy Duty Power Press for Punching of Strip: 50 tonnes (With Electricals) 2. 9 Bar Die for Punching 3. Feeder for Power Press 4. De Coiler for Strip Bundles 5. Recoiling stand for strips 6. Wooden Spools for recoiling of Strip: 18 Pieces 7. Heavy Duty Air compressor for Feeder: 5HP 8. Crimping Machine set for Mechanical crimping of strip on wire 9. Mechanical Clipping stands for clipping of coils including Pliers for same. 10. Hammering Stand The whole cost of Plant set up is Rs 12 Lac. (Approx.) The cost is exclusive of GST.

Manufacturing Process: Concertina Wire Making Process: Step 1: Procurement of raw material and first of all strip is to be punched with the help of power press and after that inside die single strip is to be created in the form of 9 pati, 13 pati etc. and stored strips in wooden spools. Step 2: With the help of crimping machine stocked strip is to be mechanically crimped on GI wire and after that as per customer requirement diameter of concertina wire to be decided like: 2 feet, 2.5 feet etc. After diameter decision coil to be prepared and count the number of spiral terms. Step 3: Incorporation of GI Clips for spring form in wire. Hamering and final packaging of goods. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1800 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 15 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

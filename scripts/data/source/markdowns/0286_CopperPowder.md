COPPER POWDER Introduction: Copper Powder is the basic raw material for many of the sintered products. These products find their uses in aircrafts, space crafts, parts for guns, porous metal bearings, filter gas diffusers, welding rods, bimetallic strips and electrical parts. The usage of copper powder has increased manifold by virtue of its physical properties, long life high scrap value and wide range of uses. Next to iron and steel, it is widely used in the market. Market Potential: The indigenous production of copper powder is only around 7000 tonnes per annum as against an estimated demand of about 15000 tonnes per annum. This itself shows the huge demand for the product in India. Since there are only a few small scale manufacturing units scattered over the country, the market potential for the product is very large.

If the ordinary process of electrolytic copper refusing is modified, the copper is deposited on electrodes as a fine powder. By suitable control over the operating conditions, a specific particle size and particle size distribution can be obtained. Electrolysis takes place in a series of glass lined special vessels having about two cathodes and three anodes per

vessel. The size of vessel is about 2.5 ft × 2.5 ft × 2.5 ft deep. The cathodes are made of aluminum sheets and anodes are of copper. The distance between the electrodes is two inches. Sometimes, pure lead is used as anode material. The electrolyte is acid copper sulphate solution containing about 10 grams per litre of copper sulphate and 20–50 grams of sulphuric acid. Continuously electrical energy is supplied and by 4 means of wooden handled aluminum scraps, the copper powder is detached from the electrodes and allowed to fall down to the bottom periodically. After removal, the powder is centrifuged and washed with water until it is free of copper sulphate. Final drying takes place on trays in an electrically heated oven having forced air circulation system at a temperature of 60°C to 100°C. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

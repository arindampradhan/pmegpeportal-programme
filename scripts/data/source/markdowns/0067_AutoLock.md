PROJECT REPORT ON AUTO LOCK INTRODUCTION: Auto Lock are one of the basic need of automobile of four wheel drive or two wheel drive. These locks are of different need for automobile i.e. for locking of vehicle/petrol tank locking etc. These are made by the processes of pressure die casting/sheet metal & finally assembled by pin locking. Most of the parts will be manufactured in the unit itself & only small spring will be procured from local unit. Market: This item has a good scope due to increase in production of automobile in the country. This item can be supplied to different automobile manufacturers as original equipment & can also be sold in the market as replacement market 2

BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: Raw material used in the manufacture of auto lock is indigenously available. Although we can manufacture all types of auto locks for different vehicle can be manufactured with the plants & machinery provided in the project but the economics of this project have been worked out for the handle lock of two-wheeler. There is no IS Specification available on the auto locks, but these are manufactured as per the buyers specification of own design. 1. The basic for the calculation of the production capacity is normally on single shift basis on 65% efficiency and 300 working days have been considered per annum. 2. The rate of interest in return has been taken on the basis of 11.00% at an average; however, this figure is likely to vary depending on the financial outlay of the project as per location of the unit. 3. It will take 4-5 years to achieve full capacity utilization. 4. Labour wages have been taken as per prevailing rates of market. 5. Land and building has been provided on rental basis. An average rent have been taken (it varies from place to place.) 6. The break-even point in the scheme has been calculated on full capacity utilization basis. 7. The cost of machinery and equipment items as indicated as refer to particular make and the prices are approximate those ruling at the time of preparation of this report. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: The major activities in the implementation of the project have been listed below and the average time for implementation of the project is estimated at 6 months: Work schedule Period (in months)  Preparation of project report 1  Registration and other formalities 1  Sanction of loan by financial institutions 1  Plant & Machinery a) Placement of orders b) Procurement 1 c) Power connection/Electrification 1 d) Installation/Erection of machinery/ Test equipment 1  Procurements of raw material 1  Recruitment of Technical Staff etc. 1  Trial Production Commercial Production 1 1. Many of the above activities shall be initiated concurrently 2. Procurement of raw materials commences from the 6-7th month onwards. 3

TECHNICAL ASPECTS: Process Outline: Main body of the lock/lever holding pin is made on pressure die casting with the help of dies. Die casting is a metal casting process that is characterized by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mould cavity. The mould cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mould during the process. Lever holding pin is further machined on Lathe/milling for making slots for fixing of levers are made on power press with the help of punching dies. Then these levers are fitted in plunger & put in main body and pin is fixed for final assembly. Key will be procured from outside. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARD: The quality of the spare parts purchased for assembly purposes should be ascertained and after assembly, the performance of each part is checked manually. PRODUCTION CAPACITY: It is proposed that 1,50,000 Pcs. of Auto Locks of assorted size will be assembled / manufactured per annum MOTIVE POWER: 25 HP Power will be required. POLLUTION CONTROL: No pollution is involved in the manufacturing process of Auto Clutch plates because it is only an assembly unit. LABOUR REQUIREMENT: 6-7 Manpower is required for manufacturing Includes: 1 Production Engineer 2 Skilled Labour 4 Semiskilled Labour BANK LOAN Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11.00% 4

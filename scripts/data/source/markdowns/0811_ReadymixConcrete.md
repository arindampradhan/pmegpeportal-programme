READY MIX CONCRETE Introduction: Ready-mix concrete (RMC) is a ready-to-use material, with predetermined mixture of cement, sand, aggregates and water. RMC is a type of concrete manufactured in a factory according to a set recipe or as per specifications of the customer, at a centrally located batching plant. It is delivered to a worksite, often in truck mixers capable of mixing the ingredients of the concrete or just before delivery of the batch. This results in a precise mixture, allowing specialty concrete mixtures to be developed and implemented on construction sites. The second option available is to mix the concrete at the batching plant and deliver the mixed concrete to the site in an agitator truck, which keeps the mixed concrete in correct form. Uses & Market Potential: RMC is preferred to on-site concrete mixing because of the precision of the mixture and reduced worksite confusion. It facilitates speedy construction through programmed delivery at site and mechanized operation with consequent economy. It also decreases labour, site supervising cost and project time, resulting in savings. Proper control and economy in use of raw material results in saving of natural resources. It assures consistent quality through accurate computerized control of

aggregates and water as per mix designs. It minimizes cement wastage due to bulk handling and there is no dust problem and therefore, pollution-free. The growth of RMC is predominantly driven by demand from the metro cities. In cities like Mumbai, the mandatory use of RMC is in construction of flyovers provided the requisite impetus to growth, according to an ICRA analysis. RMC is particularly useful when the building activity is located in congested sites where little space is available for siting the mixer and for stock piling of aggregates. Following are the places where Ready to mix concrete (RMC) can be used:  Major concerting projects like dams, roads, bridges, tunnels, canals etc.  For concreting in congested areas where storage of materials is not possible.  Sites where intensity of traffic makes problems.  When supervisor and labour staff is less.  To reduce the time required for construction etc.  Huge industrial and residential projects. Raw material: Major materials used are as follows: 1. Aggregate 2. Cement 3. Fly ash 4. Sand 5. Packing material (20kg, 50kg bags, etc.) Manufacturing Process: The raw materials are procured and are thoroughly tested for their quality and physical properties. The required raw materials are stored in Silos in required quantity. Lime stone is put into the crusher where the material is crushed. Aggregates are transferred to crusher where crushing activity takes place and are crushed in required size. The

material is then transferred to Compressed Air mixer in which the required material is mixed. The final product or mixture is then transferred to Silo for storing purpose. Finally the mixture that is ready for sale is packed in 25kg or 50 kg bags as per market and consumer preference. Machinery & equipments: Basic machines & equipments are: Name Unit Price Crusher 2 190000 Compressed Air mixer 1 140000 Silos 5 500000 Other equipments ( Bins, compressor, LS 120000 pumps, etc.) Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs.(Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain

Firstly it makes way for utilization of available organic wastes to produce the rich source of organic manure of high quality, which is superior to other types of organic manures in its physico-chemical and biological properties. Secondly, the manure is produced in a shorter duration of time of six weeks and is a fully matured, homogenous matter. Thirdly, the programme provides job opportunities for the unskilled labour force. Finally, it is the best way of safe guarding the environment. Vermi-compost (compost produced by the activity of selected species of earthworms) has been adjudged as the best source of organic amendments to soil. Using vermicompost can fulfill the requirements for organically grown products. 1 Name of the Product : Vermicompost (Bio-Manure) 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Building Shed 1900 sq.ft.

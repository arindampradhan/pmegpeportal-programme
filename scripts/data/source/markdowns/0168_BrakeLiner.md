1. INTRODUCTION Brake linings are the consumable surfaces in brake systems, such as drum brakes and disc brakes used in transport vehicles. During braking, brake linings apply frictional forces to a cylindrical drum attached to the wheel to reduce its speed and enhance control of the vehicle. Brake linings are composed of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction (and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or rivets. The complete assembly (including lining and backing) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe. 2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Brake liners are used for applying frictional forces to a cylindrical drum attached to the wheel to reduce its speed and enhance control of the vehicle. The brake shoe expands by air pressure (expander) or hydraulic pressure (wheel cylinder) to press the brake linings against the drum, producing a frictional force which reduces and controls the speed of the vehicle.

PROJECT PROFILE FOR COIR BRUSH MAKING/ TWISTED WIRE MAT PRODUCTIONUNIT INTRODUCTION The common varieties of coir brushes are Commode Brush, Bannister Brush, Floor Sweeping Brush, Table Cleaning Brush, Bottle Cleaning Brush, Scrubbing Brush, Foam Cleaning Brush, Boot Polishing Brush, Hair Brush and Basin Cleaning Brush. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE Preparation of Coir fibre for Brushes Bristle fibre of long staple length is preferred which are available in small bundles of 2” diameter. The bristle fibre bundles are untied and the fibres are subjected to a combing process for the removal of adhering pith and short fibres. Combing also helps to parallelize the fibre. The combing involves drawing of the fibres through a row of steel spikes (nails) usually 8 in numbers, each about 15 cm long, spaced about 2.5 cm apart and fixed vertically on a wooden table or plank. 1

Manufacture of Coir Brushes Wooden logs are sawed to sizes with the help of band saw. The resultant wood sections are cut into small sizes by circular saw. The wood sections of smaller size suitable to the type of brush are taken to the thickness planer for planning or to the wood turning lathe for turning as the case may be. After planning or turning, the wood sections are fed to the jig saw for cutting them to the required shape to suit the pattern of brushes. These wood sections are drilled with holes with the help of a sensitive drilling machine. These are then taken for tufting of coir fibre. The combed coir fibres are cut to suitable length depending on the pile height of the brush with the help of a thistle and hammer or scissors. Small bunches of cut fibres are then pinned together so as to form individual tuft of fibres to fill in the brush holes. The tuft is made by winding the GI wire of suitable gauge (18, 20& 22), cut into 2 cm length in hand lever shearer and bent into “U” shape and pressing the bunches of cut fiber at its central portion with the help of pliers. The tufts of fibre are then pressed into the holes of the wood material by hammering at the bend portions of the GI wire with the help of a punch and hammer. Thus the entire holes in the wood will be filled with fibre tufts. Thereafter the top portions of the brush will be sheared by a top shearing machine or by hand using scissors. BASIS AND PRESUMTIONS • The Project Profile is based on 8 working hours for2shifts in a day and 25 days in a month and the Break Even efficiency has been calculated on 70%, 80%, 90%, 90% and 100% capacity utilization. • The rate of interest both for fixed asset and working capital have been taken as 11.5% p.a. 2

INTRODUCTION India is endowed with a largest livestock population in the world having a total bovine population of 375 million compared to the world's total bovine population of 1550 million. It accounts for 58.2% of the world’s buffalo population and 15.1% of the cattle population. In order to meet the rapidly growing demand for milk with a focus to improve milk animal productivity and increase milk production, the Government has approved National Dairy Plan Phase. NDP-I will help to meet the projected national demand from domestic production through productivity enhancement, strengthening and expanding village level infrastructure for milk procurement and provide producers with greater access to markets. The organized dairy sector (both cooperatives and private) is presently handles about 15 per cent of total milk production in the country. Thus it indicates, there is a wide scope for processing of milk and manufacture of milk products for domestic consumption as well as export. Dairy products form one of the fastest growing segments in the livestock product export. The major export destinations are Bangladesh, Egypt, UAE, Algeria, Yemen Republic, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. The major products exported were Butter & other milk fat, cheese, Whole Milk Powder, Skimmed Milk Powder, fresh cream, ghee, butter milk etc.

MARKET POTENTIAL OF THE PROJECT India is leading in production of milk and dairy is one of the major subsidiary activities of most of the farmers. Despite of highest production in the world there is always a demand supply miss match for milk and milk products. The demand for milk and milk products is at its peak during festive occasions like Diwali, Id, Holi, etc. In order to meet the demand during its peak, the milk needs to be converted to various milk products due to its perishable nature. But there is lack of processing infrastructure in the country. Therefore, there is good scope for financing milk processing activities in entire country. The beneficiaries of the Project may be individuals, partnership firms, companies, corporate bodies, cooperative societies/unions etc. New entrepreneurs may start their business as an individual, proprietary concern, partnership firm or a joint stock company. The financial assistance is extended for processing of milk with the following objectives. i) To enhance the keeping quality of milk ii) To avoid the economic losses to farmers by procuring the milk in time from them iii) To manufacture various milk products as per market demand iv) To provide quality products at affordable prices to the consumers.

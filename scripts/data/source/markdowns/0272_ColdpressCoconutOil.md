COLD WOOD PRESSED COCONUT OIL PLANT Introduction Coconut oil, or copra oil, is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts harvested from the coconut palm. Coconut oil, also known as coconut butter, is a tropical oil with many applications. It is extracted from copra (derived from Malayalam word "kopra" which means dried coconut). Coconut oil contains mostly saturated fat, along with some unsaturated fat. Cold-pressed coconut oil is best for medium-heat cooking and excellent for baking and recipes where you want to impart a delicate coconut flavor. Benefits of Cold pressed coconut Oil  Extracted from 100% top quality coconut copras, 100% cold pressed, unrefined, fresh & natural  Can be used for cooking for diet purpose  Great supplement for baby care, hair & skin care  Promotes healthy metabolism & improves immunity  Hair: Reduce Protein Loss & Nourishes.  Head: Eliminates Mental Fatigue.  Skin: Prevents Wrinkles, Sagging, Dryness & Flaking.  Strengthens Immune System & Improves Bone Strength & Dental Health.  Diabetes: Intake Controls Blood Sugar Levels & Improves Insulin Secretion.  Prevents hair fall, controls dandruff and strengthens hair

Product & its application Coconut oil contains a certain kind of fat known as "medium chain triglycerides." Some of these fats work differently than other types of saturated fat in the body. When applied to the skin, coconut oil has a moisturizing effect. Uses of Copra Cake (By-product) The terms “copra cake” and “copra meal” sometimes refer respectively to the mechanically extracted and the solvent extracted product. However, the names are often interchangeable in practice and in this datasheet copra meal will be used as a generic term to designate the oil by-product. Raw Material Dry Coconut Known as copra is used as basic raw material for Cold Pressed Coconut Oil plant. Copra is valued for the coconut oil extracted from it and for the resulting residue, coconut-oil cake, which is used mostly for livestock feed. Cold Pressed Coconut Oil Market Analysis The global cold-pressed oil market size was valued at $24.62 billion in 2018, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% to reach $36.40 billion by 2026. Globally 5.5 million tons of coconuts are produced annually. It has a very wide export potential market as well. Many manufacturers have begun to use coconut oil in packaged products, and many people use it for cooking. Many products, such as fried foods, sweets, shampoos, coffee, smoothies etc. contain coconut oil. Therefore the demand for coconut oil is more, so it is profitable to start the coconut oil manufacturing business.

Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for manufacturing of Cold Pressed Coconut Oil:  Wood press Ghani Machine  5 HP Motor  Filter Machine  Other equipment’s: Storage tank Processing Coconut oil products claim to be "cold pressed" coconut oil. This generally means that a mechanical method of pressing out the oil is used, but without the use of any outside heat source. The high pressure needed to press out the oil generates some heat naturally, but the temperature is controlled so that temperatures do not exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Manufacturing Process  Take the raw material (Copra) & put it into the Ghani machine hopper.  After that start the machine & process of crushing the copra will start. It requires manual manpower to operate the machine as well as for the crushing process.  It takes time to manually crush the material through cold press and the generation of oil from it.  Next step is to collect th oil from the machine kept it open for some time to cool & after that put it into the filter machine for the filtering process.  After filtering of oil, product is ready for packaging. One round of Coconut oil production takes 45 minutes for completion of production process. Maximum 10 completed Rounds of coconut oil production can be done in a shift of 8 hours a day. Normally Mustard oil is generated at 40-45% of raw material.

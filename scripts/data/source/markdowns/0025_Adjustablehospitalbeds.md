PROJECT PROFILE ON ADJUSTABLE HOSPITAL BED PRODUCT & ITS USES Adjustable hospital beds are made of steel & normally used in Govt. Hospital, Private Hospital, & Nursing homes etc. There are two types of hospital beds namely: i) General purpose Hospital Bed Steeds ii) Fowlers Hospital Beds MARKET POTENTIAL The demands for adjustable beds are increasing day by day due to the following reasons: i) Increase the number of Hospitals in private sector& their expansion ii) Increase in number of private & Government nursing homes & their expansion. The Govt. is encouraging new hospitals & nursing homes in private sectors in order to increase treatment facilities in accordance with the development in public health sector & as such it is likely to be a steady increase in the demand for hospital furniture. However, the growth rate is expected to be more than 5% to 8% per year and as such it may be ideal for the existing steel furniture manufacturer units to take up this activity for not only as diversification but also better capacity utilization by installing a few balancing equipments.

PRODUCTION TARGET It is proposed to manufacturer 600 adjustable Beds per annum BASIS & ASSUMPTIONS i) This project profile is based on 8 working hours a day and 25 days in a month and the break even efficiency has been calculated on 60% capacity utilization basis. ii) The gestation period in implementation of the project may be about 8 to 12 months. This period included making all arrangements, completion of all formalities, market surveys and tie ups, financial arrangements, purchase of machines, recruitment of staff, commissioning of plant and trial production etc. iii) The normal wages and salaries being paid in the industry to various grades of personnel have been considered and also the provision of minimum wages has been taken care of. iv) The rate of interest both for fixed and working capital have been taken as 11.50% P. A. v) The payback period for finance to the financial institutions may be about 5 years in case of term loan. The working capital loan may however be in a shape of rolling/limit based capital. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: Implementation of the project involve various activities like market surveys and tie- ups, procurement of know-how, arrangement of premises/ land, building, preparation of project report, registration, financing, purchase of machines, commissioning of project, recruitment of staff and training, arrangement of power, procurement of raw materials, packing materials, trial production etc. in order to implement the project efficiently and in the shortest period there is a need to initiate many activities simultaneously as far as possible. This will not only cut the slack period but also will give quick results and be cost effective. It is advised to follow PERT/CPM/NET WORKanalysistechnique for implementation along with their estimated time requirement is given below: S. No. Activity Estimated period required 1. Market survey 15-20 days 2. Procurement of know-how/experts 30 days 3. Arrangement of premises 30-45 days 4. Obtaining quotations and 15-20 days preparation of project report. 5. Registration and financing. 45-60 days 6. Recruitment of personnel and 30-45 days training. 7. Obtaining power connection. 15-30 days 8. Procurement of machines and 45-60 days equipments.

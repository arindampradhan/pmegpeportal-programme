SKIN CARE CREAM Introduction: Skin care is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients. A Skin care Cream is a higher viscosity topical preparation intended for application to the skin due to low water content. Body creams are similar to lotions in that they, too, are a combination of oil and water. However, creams are thicker in their consistency and have a higher concentration of oil than water when compared to lotions. This thicker consistency is designed to provide a stronger barrier for the skin to keep it hydrated. Hydrated skin is less likely to wrinkle and has a natural glow.

4. Tube filling & Sealing section 1 750000 5. Other equipments & hand tools Ls 25000 Total 3250000 Manufacturing Process: All raw material are procured form vendor and stored in raw material warehouse as per production requirement. The raw material are brought to plant and fed to their respective storage vessels utilizing appropriate material handling equipment. The measured quantity of raw material is inducted into mixer vessel utilizing appropriate feed control system using sensors like load cell and flow meter, from their respective storage vessels using appropriate pumps. The raw materials are inducted in their required sequence and mixed for predetermined time as per requirement of product. The temperature during mixing is maintained using water jackets of mixer vessel. Once the mixing is complete the product is pumped into holding tank of filling machine, from where it’s filled in open tubes by the filling machine followed by which there bottoms are crimped using a crimping machine. The important details can be requested to be printed by the vendor supplying tubes for product or inject printing machine can be installed online, to print the same. The product filled tubes are then packed in cartons and sent for sale.

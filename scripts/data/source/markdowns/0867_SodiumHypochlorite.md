Project Report on Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleaching Liquid) INTRODUCTION: Hypochlorite’s are chemical compounds containing the chlorate (I) anion ([OCl]-). It is a greenish – yellowish liquid commonly referred to as “Bleach”. Sodium Hypochlorite (Na OCl) is a compound that can be effectively used for surface purification, water disinfectants (Disinfectants are microbial agents that are applied to nonliving objects to destroy microorganisms, the process of which is known as disinfection), bleaching, odour removal etc. It has a relative density of [5.5% water solution]. It is unstable and Chlorine evaporates. It is strong oxidizer and reacts with flammable compounds however its solution is a weak base that is inflammable. MARKET POTENTIAL: It has following applications in general:

 It is the main ingredient in laundry bleach. It is used extensively as a bleaching agent in the textiles, detergents paper & pulp industries.  It is used as disinfectant in water and waste water treatment plants and sanitary equipments.  State Government, Corporations, Nagar Parishad etc. are the major customers of the product to use it as disinfectant in water.  It is applied in swimming pools for water disinfection.  In Food Processing Industry , it is used to sanitize food preparation equipments.  In petrochemical industry, it is used in petroleum products refining. The following table shows some of the varying strengths of the product and how the variations are typically used : Wt % of Sodium Common Uses Hypochlorite 2 % Shock Chlorination of Wells 3-6 % Household Disinfectant, Laundring Clothes, Dentistry Root Canal Treatment Disinfectent in Hospitals, Food Processing, Fish Processing etc. 12-16 % Disinfectant in Swimming Pools, Water Treatment, Waste Water Treatment etc. BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: a. The production is based on single shift of eight hours and 300 working days per annum. b. The cost in respect of Plant & Machinery has been taken at the time of preparation of Project Profile, which may vary from place to place and time to time. c. Labour charges has been taken as per Govt. norms. d. It is presumed that plant will work at 50% efficiency in the first year, 60% in the third year and 70% in the third year.

4. TECHNICAL ASPECTS: a. Production Capacity : 600 K. L. per Annum b. Quality Control & Standards : As per IS 11673:1992 The requirements for Sodium Hypochlorite Solution are as under : Sr. Characteristics Requirements No. Grade 1 Grade 2 01. Relative density (at 250 / 250 C) 1.07 to 1.118 1.20 Min. 02. Available Chlorine (as Cl), percent by mass by 4.0 to 6.0 12.5 to 15.0 volume 03. Total Chlorine, percent by volume ( as Cl) 4.0 to 6.0 12.5 to 15.0 04. Free Alkali (as Na OH), g/l. Min. 1.0 5.0 05. Free Sodium Carbonate (as Na2CO3), g/l, Min. 0.5 0.5 06. Iron ( as Fe), ppm, Max. 0.4 1.0 07. Sodium Chlorate, percent by mass, Max. 0.05 0.3 (c) Manufacturing Method: It is produced by Hooker process in the large scale. At the small scale it is produced by reacting Caustic Soda Lye (35%) with dosing of Chlorine gas accompanied by cooling. In a plastic tank first we take Caustic Soda Lye (35%) and then chlorine dosing is done. After 7-8 hours of chemical reaction, sodium hypochlorite (Na OCl) is produced. It is exothermic reaction and temperature is about 35 – 400C. The sample is taken out for checking Chlorine percentage and only after Q. C. approval the product is packed in suitable plastic containers. 2 Na OH + Cl2 Na Cl + Na OCl + H2O

(d) Packaging, Marking & Storing The material shall be packed in air tight plastic containers or as agreed between the purchaser and the supplier. The containers used shall be dry and free from grease, dirt or other foreign matter likely to cause decomposition of the material. Each package shall bear legibly and indelibly the following information:  Name & Grade of the Material  Indication of the source of the manufacture.  Gross & Net mass.  Date of Packing.  Lot Number  Available Chlorine i.e. the measure of the oxidizing power of the chlorine present as hypochlorite expressed in terms of chlorine with a gram equivalent mass of 35.46 (to be declared by the manufacturer.) The material shall be stored in a cool and dark place. While shipping, the material shall be stored away from boilers or any other source of emanating heat and light. Special Considerations in Packaging Household sodium hypochlorite bleach was introduced to Americans in 1909 and sold in steel containers, then in glass bottles. In the early 1960s, the introduction of the plastic jug brought a cheaper, lighter, and non-breakable packaging alternative. It reduced transportation costs and protected the safety of workers involved in its shipping and handling. Additionally, the thick plastic did not permit ultraviolet light to reach the bleach, which improved its chemical stability and effectiveness. In recent years, how-ever, plastic containers have become an environmental concern because of the time it takes the material to decompose in a landfill. Many companies that depend on plastic packaging, including bleach manufacturers, have begun to reduce the amount of plastic in their packaging or to use recycled plastics. In the early 1990s, Clorox introduced post-consumer resins (PCR) in its packaging. The newer bottles are a blend of virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and 25% recycled plastic, primarily from clear milk jug-type bottles.

Consumer Safety The bleach manufacturing industry came under fire during the 1970s when the public became concerned about the effects of household chemicals on personal health. Dioxin, a carcinogenic byproduct of chemical manufacturing, is often found in industrial products used to bleach paper and wood. In its final bottled form, common sodium hypochlorite bleach does not contain dioxins because chlorine must be in a gaseous state for dioxins to exist. However, chlorine gas can form when bleach comes into contact with acid, an ingredient in some toilet-bowl cleaners, and the labels on household bleach contain specific warnings against such combination. In addition to the danger of dioxins, consumers have also been concerned about the toxicity of chlorine in sodium hypochlorite bleach. However, the laundry process deactivates the potentially toxic chlorine and causes the formation of salt water.

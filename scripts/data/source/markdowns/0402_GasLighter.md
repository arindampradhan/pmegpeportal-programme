GAS LIGHTER Introduction: The electronic gas lighter uses apiezo-electric crystal. This crystal has a property to generate voltage when it is mechanically deformed. It generates high voltage across a spark gap which when in proximity to a gas would ignite it. Gas lighters are being used by cooking gas users. It is used in gas stoves which do not have automatic ignition systems. It uses a physical phenomenon called piezo-electric effect to generate an electric spark which ignites the combustible gas from the stove burner. It is durable due to its performance and economical as compared to the mechanical and electrical lighters. It does not require battery for its operation. It is safer, economical, reliable and quick inaction. It requires virtually no maintenance. The gas lighter is mostly cylindrical in shape and consists of a piezo-electric crystal over which a spring-loaded hammer is placed. The hammer and spring set up is attached to a button. When this button is pressed, the hammer is moved away from the piezo-electric crystal. Uses & Market Potential: The demand of any type of gas lighter is directly related to the release of domestic gas connections by various gas companies in the country. The preference to use electronic gas lighters is quite high because of inherent advantages stated above. Even existing gas users have been increasingly switching over to electronic gas lighters. At

present, there is no small scale unit engaged in the manufacture of electronic gas lighter major states of India. The cost of gas lighter is very well within the reach of users and therefore demand is increasing day by day. Raw Material: Major raw material requirements are as follows: 1. Stainless Steel 202 Pipe 2. PP Resins or ABS resins 3. Piezo-Electric Igniter 4. Packing material Machinery & Equipments: Major machineries & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Semi-Automatic pipe cutting machine 1 74000 2. Fly Press Machine 1 10000 3. Bench Drilling Machine 1 38000 4. Bench Grinder 1 6000 5. Injection Molding Machine 1 150000 6. Other machineries & equipments 50000 Total Amount 328000 Manufacturing Process: At first, the raw material is procured from the authorized local vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the stainless steel tube are brought from the inventory and sheared along its length as per the required dimension of the lighter. This operation is performed by using hydraulic semi-automatic pipe cutting machine. In the next step, the desired profile of the lighter is machined over the pipe surface using fly press. It is used for piercing holes in sheet metal work using fly press tool. The holes are drilled using suitable drill bits on the ignition end of the lighter using drilling machine.

In the next step, the pipe is fed into embossing machine to impart the desired profile over the surface of the pipe. The pipe is pressed between two rolling threaded dies of desired profile. In the next step, the outer surface of the pipe is grinded to remove any excess outlines and impart desired profile. This improves overall luster of the lighter and improves its look. After this, the PP and ABS resins are fed into the hopper along with additives like colorants, foaming agents, and other fillers. The machine barrel heater are tuned on and brought up to the desired meting temperature of the resin. When resin melts the barrel compress the molten plastic into the profile dies to form the desired contours. After this, it solidifies to form the desired molded part. In the next step, the Piezo-electric igniter along with spring is assembled inside the gas lighter to perform the desired function. In the next step, the quality testing of the assembly is performed to check the desired function accuracy. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs.(Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the

material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require Implementation Schedule: S No. Activity Time required 1. Acquisition of premises 1-2 Months 2. Procurement & installation of Plant & Machinery 1-2 Months 3. Arrangement of Finance 1.5-2 Months 4. Requirement of required Manpower 1 Month 5.

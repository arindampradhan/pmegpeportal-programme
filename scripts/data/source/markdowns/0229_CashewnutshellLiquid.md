CASHEW NUT SHELL LIQUID Introduction: Cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL ) is a versatile by product of the cashew industry. The nut has a shell of about 1/8 inch thickness inside which is a soft honey comb structure containing a dark reddish brown viscous liquid. It is called cashew nut shell liquid, which is the pericap fluid of the cashew nut. It is often considered as the better and cheaper material for unsaturated phenols. The shell liquid, which is extracted out of the outer shell of the nut, also has industrial applications in the automotive industry, leather, and tobacco curing. Uses & Market Potential: CNSL is a versatile industrial raw material with diverse use in friction linings, paints and varnishes, laminating and epoxy resins, foundry chemicals and as an intermediary of chemicals. CNSL is also used in the making of resins for paints and foundry core oils, insulating varnishes and the like. Of late, the shell liquid has been extensively distilled to produce Cardanol, which is used in the preparation of friction dust for brake linings and also in rubber compounding formulations.

The global Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (Cnsl) market is anticipated to rise at a considerable rate during the forecast period, between 2020 and 2025. In 2020, the market was growing at a steady rate and with the rising adoption of strategies by key players, the market is expected to rise over the projected horizon. Machinery & Equipments: Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Oil expeller 4. 5 MT capacity per hrs mounted 1 550000 on steel fabricated channel fitted with oil tray. Thrust bearing single helical generator with 20 HP motor starter and all other accessories 2. 2 HP Motor for filter Press 1 30000 3. Filter Press 22 plates 22‟x 22‟ with plunger 1 250000 pump 4. M. S.(Tank) 2500 Lt. capacity 3 150000 5. Other machinery & equipments 120000 Total Amount 1100000 Raw material: Major raw material that is used is raw cashew nut shell and packing material for packing final product. Manufacturing Process: Cashew nut is processed by two methods i.e. a) Roasting process, and b) Oil extraction process. Some manufactures use the first method while some others prefer the second method from which the oil is obtained as a by-product. Raw Cashew nut shell contains over 20 % CNSL. In the oil bath process about 10 % of oil is recovered as a by-product. By using expellers from extraction, it is possible to extract a further quantity of about 10% more from the shells. Thus from 1 ton of shells using oil bath process, up to 100 kg of good quality of CNSL could be extracted by using oil expellers.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs. 4 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)

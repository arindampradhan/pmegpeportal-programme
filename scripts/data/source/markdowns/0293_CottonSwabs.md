COTTON SWAB INTRODUCTION Cotton Swabs are a personal hygiene items that are used to clean ear wax from ear canals, they are basically a cotton bud attached to a stalk which can be composed of plastic or wood; stalk basically provides the gripping surface to the user, so as to allow user to handle the swab. It’s a simple product and can be manufactured manually at home without any machinery for personal use but as for industrial production a certain quality standard is required along with mass production, thus an automated machine is used to do so. They may have cotton bud on one or both sides depending upon the type of cotton swab, apart from their primary use they are also used as make-up tool and cleaning aid for delicate artistic objects.

RAW MATERIAL 1) Cotton Roll 2) Stalk Material (Plastic, Rolled Paper or Wood) 3) Packaging Material MACHINE REQUIRED The manufacturing process of cotton swab includes roll winding and packaging; thus, the machine required are, 1) Automatic Cotton Swab Making Machine This machine is a special purpose machine specifically designed to manufacture cotton swabs without any adhesive, utilizing high speed tension winding.

## Page 5

MANUFACTURING PROCESS The cotton roll is placed in an unwinding and feeding section while stalks of selected material (wood, rolled paper or plastic) are feed to hopper and feeder arrangement of cotton swab making machine, then all the settings like speed, number of loops etc. are made via control panel. Thus the machine starts operation, it simultaneously pulls cotton roll and stalks into the roll winding section; cotton roll is simply unrolled, followed by which only metered quantity of cotton is allowed into roll winding section, on the other hand hopper and feeder arrangement feeds the stalks to a vibrator and sorter arrangement which sorts the stalks in an appropriate orientation, followed by which stalks are allowed to fall on a conveyor in same orientation. This conveyor leads stalks into roll winding section. In roll winding section stalk is held and rotated against the cotton so as to form a cotton bud, depending upon the type of cotton swab, cotton bud can be produced on one or both sides of the stalk. The finished cotton swabs are moved out of machine via a conveyor arrangement from where they are collected in an appropriate storage arrangement. These Cotton Swabs can either be manually packed or feed to cotton swab packaging machine through its hopper and feeder arrangement, which leads them to machines vibrator and sorting section, which vibrates cotton swabs so as to orient them in an appropriate direction followed by which they are counted by machine and packaged in their plastic boxes in fixed quantity. These boxes are then packed in carton and sent for sale. The Automatic Cotton Swab Making Machine can also be coupled with Cotton Swab Packaging Machine, in this case the conveyer of Cotton Swab Making Machine delivers finished cotton swab directly to hopper of Cotton Swab Packaging Machine; so as to reduce manpower requirement.

QUALITY CONTROL A number of quality control measures are used to ensure cotton swabs are acceptable. The spindles must be checked to ensure they are straight and free of imperfections, such as stress cracks or other moulding defects. The cotton used to coat the ends must be of specific purity, softness, and fibre length. The finished swabs must be free from lose adhesive and sharp edges, and the tips must be tightly wrapped. These measures are particularly critical for swabs designed for infant use. For swabs intended for other applications, other quality requirements may be more important. For example, swabs used for biological purposes must remain sterile until used. For some applications, lack of loose lint maybe imperative. The particular quality control requirements will vary with the application. Of course, each box of swabs must be weighed to make sure the correct number of swabs are packed in each box. MARKET OPPURTUNITY Currently, cotton bud’s sales are increasing. Generally, modern retailing and grocery retailing are the major distribution channel of this product. Furthermore, manufacturers diversifying their product ranges from adult- centric to baby and children-centric. And it also helps sales to grow. Cotton buds are the consumable item. Additionally, these are essential items in infant care. Other than this it also used as makeup accessories and gadget cleaner accessories. While the market is predominated by some national brand, local brands are also becoming popular as they come with a more convenient price. Therefore, the product has an increasing market demand throughout the country. So, starting the cotton buds manufacturing project is a great opportunity for new entrepreneurs.

BYPRODUCTS/WASTE The swab manufacturing process can generate waste in the form of loose cotton as well as plastic, paper, or wood scrap, depending on what material is used to make the spindles. Some of the cotton can be reclaimed and either incorporated back into the incoming feed path or used elsewhere as scrap. The plastic used in spindles is thermoplastic, which means it can be reground and re melted for later use. THE FUTURE A more recent innovation used to help prevent the swab from damaging ear tissue is a swab with extra cotton filling the hollow spindle. To achieve the effect, the swab applicator is made by extruding a plastic tube over a resilient mass of cotton. One end of the stick is fitted with a cap and the other end has a more traditional swab-like protrusion of cotton. The cap can be removed and the fibre core filled with any liquid that is desired to be dispensed. This technique could be useful for applying a variety of cleaning fluids or topical medicines. Future developments in swab technology may play a role in space technology was well. The Micro Clean Company, under a technology license from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has recently perfected the first cotton swab that has the absorption qualities of cotton yet meets NASA's lint- free, adhesive-free requirement for clean room use. This swab is enclosed in a nylon sheath and the wood handle is enclosed in a shrink film to prevent fibre release or other contamination. The shrink film allows the dowel to absorb more stress, making it easier to use and less likely to slip in the hand. The sheathing and shrink film can be custom designed for special applications or specific solvent compatibility.

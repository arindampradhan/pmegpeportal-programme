1. INTRODUCTION A chicken nugget is a chicken product made from either meat slurry or chicken breasts cut to shape, breaded or battered, then deep-fried or baked. Fast food restaurants typically fry their nuggets in vegetable oil, such as coconut oil. The chicken nugget was invented in the 1950s by Robert C. Baker, a food science professor at Cornell University, and published as unpatented academic work. Dr. Baker's innovations made it possible to form chicken nuggets in any shape. Mc Donald's recipe for Chicken Mc Nuggets was created on commission from Mc Donald's by Tyson Foods in 1979 and the product was sold beginning in 1980. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Invented in the 1950s, chicken nuggets have become a very popular fast food restaurant item, as well as widely sold frozen for home use. Chicken Nuggets are widely used in households as ready to eat snacks and are also loved by people of all age groups. Chicken Nuggets are one of the most commonly eaten dish in fast food restaurants.

2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL The major raw material required for processing Chicken Nuggets are:  Chicken meat breasts  Flour  Cornstarch  Sea salt  Edible oil  Food preservatives 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The processing required for making chicken nuggets begins with deboning. The chicken is cut and shaped to the correct size. This is done either manually, or by a series of automatic blades, or by a process called grinding (a method of deboning in which the softer parts of the chicken carcass are forced through a mesh, leaving behind the more solid pieces, resulting in a meat paste. If used, this paste is then shaped before battering). The pieces are battered and breaded in a large cylindrical drum that rotates, evenly coating all of the pieces in the desired spices and breading. The pieces are then fried in oil until the batter has set and the outside reaches the desired color. Finally, the nuggets are packaged, frozen and stored for shipping. CHICKEN DEBONING The process of making Chicken Nuggets starts with "deboning" with whole chickens. All the chicken cuts are separated and the Chicken Breast Meat are set aside for the Chicken Nuggets. TRIMMING OF CHICKEN BREAST This process involves trimming of chicken breast of fat. BELNDING The chicken breasts that have been separated are collected into bin for blending. Inside the blender, the ground chicken meat is mixed with some seasonings and chicken skin for flavoring.

The blended chicken meat is portioned in equal proportion for giving them the shape of Chicken . Nuggets. The Shape of the Chicken Nuggets can be: The ball, the bell, the boot, and the bow tie BATTERING AND BREADING Then the shaped pieces of Chicken Nuggets are firstly covered in light batter for evenly coating all of the pieces in the desired spices and breading to give crisp texture to the nuggets. After being dipped in the light batter, they are covered in a second, thicker batter called tempura. FRYING The pieces are then fried in oil until the batter has set and the outside reaches the desired color. The pieces have only been partially cooked at this stage. COOLING The fried nuggets will be kept in freezer for cooling after which they will be frozen and packaged. FROZEN, PACKAGING AND SHIPPING Standard and recommended formulated nuggets were packed in low density polyethylene bags, sealed and then kept at frozen storage (−18 ± 2 °C) for 0, 25, 50 and 75 days. The products were analysed at studied interval after thawing in a refrigerator (4 ± 1 °C) for 5–6 h.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY UPS & Stabilizer Assembling Unit business is proposed in all major cities Products include UPS and Stabilizers of different capacities. Installed capacity of assembling unit is 12 units of UPS per day and 08 units of stabilizers per day. Initial capacity utilization will be 50%. The total cost of project is Rs. 17.70lacs with fixed investment of Rs.7.10lacs and working capital of Rs.10.50lacs BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT & PRODUCT UPS is the abbreviation of Un‐interrupted Power Supply and mainly consists of a transformer, printed circuit board, switches and casing / housing, whereas, stabilizer is a simple support machine used to regulate the voltage. There are many ways to commence a full production unit which needs comparatively much higher fixed investment. The best and the simplest way is purchasing parts / accessories, assembly and distribution. This would likely decrease chances of loss in case of business closure and provide a safe exit. In addition, it may help the entrepreneur to manage the stock and fulfill orders timely. UPS & Stabilizer assembling unit business means setting up a workshop where assembling takes place and setting up an office for carrying out general administrative and marketing work. The business facility will maintain inventory consisting of accessories including transformers, transfer switches, printed circuit boards and housing used to assemble UPS & Stabilizer to meet market requirement and orders effectively. The company will divide the store into two parts: one side will be used to store accessories and the other for finished products. The power crisis has compelled a significant number of consumers to fulfill their basic electricity need through some alternative source of power. In India, public and private power generation units do not have the capacity to meet the increasing electricity requirements of the population. This clearly indicates a strong demand for UPS and stabilizer products in coming years. • Technology: The proposed unit would require tools and equipment for assembling and quality assurance / testing departments. List of tools and equipment is given in machinery and equipment section. • Product: The unit would assemble UPS of 1,000, 1,200 and 1,500 watts and Stabilizers of 1,000 VA and 2,000 VA.

• Target Market: There is a large market in all urban centers and semi urban areas of India. However, it is recommended to sell the products in the same city where the assembling unit is being established. • Employment Generation: The proposed project will provide direct employment to 5 people. Financial analysis shows that the unit will be profitable from the very first year of operation. INSTALLED AND OPERATIONAL CAPACITIES The daily assembling capacity of the proposed UPS and stabilizer unit would be around 12 and 08 units per day respectively. Initially operational capacity would be 50% of installed capacity and would be increased 10% annually. The proposed assembling unit will be located in any commercial area where basic infrastructure and facilities necessary for a UPS and Stabilizer assembling unit are available. GEOGRAPHICAL POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENT Due to scheduled and unscheduled power outages, the demand of UPS, stabilizers and batteries increased manifolds during last few years. Both the urban and rural areas are facing load shedding problems round the year. In India, since last few years the demand and supply gap of electricity has remained an unsolvable problem and people are now seeking alternate power sources more than ever. This unit can be set up in all major cities across the country Generators available with different specification and usage criteria are commonly used in industries where load is comparatively much higher than households. UPS (stand‐by) is the preferred option in industries like healthcare where power break down in production / operations cannot be afforded. UPS is not only gaining popularity in urban areas, but developed suburbs are also using this new power backup. There are many households and offices, all over India where UPS is being increasingly used as an alternate source of electricity. The demand of UPS in urban areas is consistent throughout the year except for during summer season which shows a remarkable increase in the urban areas of India. POTENTIAL TARGET MARKETS/CITIES UPS and stabilizers market is divided into three main segments in urban and semi‐urban areas particularly in all major cities across the country including (cid:0) Industry / Small & Medium Enterprises (cid:0) Offices (cid:0) Households

PRODUCTION PROCESS FLOW The proposed business is an assembling unit that will purchase parts and accessories from market vendors, assemble it and sell with its own brand name. The process flow of the unit can be divided into following steps: Buying Parts Assembling Selling / / Components &Testing Storage Distribution PROJECT COST SUMMARY A detailed financial model has been developed to analyze the commercial viability of this project under the ‘Business Loan’ scheme. Various cost and revenue related assumptions along with results of the analysis are outlined in this section. The projected Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet are attached as appendices. Project Economics The following table shows internal rate of return and payback period for UPS & stabilizer assembling unit. Returns on the scheme and its profitability are highly dependent on the efficiency of the production team, interest of the owner and quality of the products and fulfilling the seasonal market demands. If there is increase load shedding, then tough competition will be faced in this business. Project Financing Following table provides details of the equity required and variables related to bank loan;

This is because; tools and accessories that are needed to be stored and used in the assembling unit are very sensitive. Therefore, during site development, proper concealed electrical wiring with extra arrangement like electric points and switch boards for technical department must kept in mind.

PROJECT PROFILE ON POWDER COATING INTRODUCTION: The Powder coating is a coating which is applied on the job in the powder form, it does not require any liquid carrier while the paint can be applied on the job in the liquid form only and requires the liquid carrier which causes the dropping sag, run and storage problem etc. It is a dry paint, which gives almost 100% finish maximum material use with no wastage in over spray, spillage etc. MARKET POTENTIAL: The powder consist of homogenous synthetic resin, pigments and other additives and in some powders the hardener or cross linking agents are used. The powder can be thermoplastic or thermosetting type. The thermoplastic materials like polyethylene, PVC, PTFE etc. are more widely used. Now-a-days the powder coating is find very wide applications in the sheet material components for the purpose of protection as well as better looking. These components are steel cabinet of Computers, VCR, VCP, Panel Boards of sophisticated equipment, metal components in Telecom Industries, steel furniture, domestic appliances, auto parts, hardware, machine parts and architectural section etc. 2

The common problems observed are the difficulty in changing the colour and peeling of the coating etc. For excellent results the seven tanks cleaning operation can be applied on the job. Though this coating is costlier than the simple paint, its long life and excellent looking proves to be cheaper. BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: (i) The efficiency of machinery is taken at 60%. The unit will work on single shift basis of 8 hrs. per day and 25 days in a month and 300 days in a year. of the total production capacity. (ii) The time period to achieve the full envisaged capacity utilization is 5year. (iii) The labor wages are as per the prevailing rates in the market (iv) The interest rate for fixed and working capital is taken as 11.00%. (v) The margin money requirement will be 10% of the total cost of this project. (vi) The payback period is 5 years. (vii) The land requirement is 150 Sq. mtrs. And the built up area is 100 sq.mtr. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: Time required for preparation of Project report : One month Selection of Site : One month Registration as SSI Unit : One Week Time required for acquiring the loan : Three months Construction of building : Three months Machinery procurement, commissioning & erection : One months Recruitment of labourer etc. : One month Trial runs : One month TECHNICAL ASPECTS: (iii) Process Outline: First the surface which is to be coated is cleaned perfectly by giving a pre- treatment i.e. degreasing, chromating so that the oil, grease, dust and rust should not remain there. Now give a phosphate coat on the surface by phosphating process, wash and dry the object. Dry powder is filled in a hopper 3

where it is fluidised by low pressure gas. When it comes to the gun through a flexible hose where it is electro-statically charged by a high voltage generator. An electrostat field is produced between the gun nozzle and the earthed object, which is already kept in spry booth. The powder particles get uniformly deposited on the object. Now remove the objects from the spray booth and keep it in the oven at the temp. approx. 150o C for 10 to 15 minutes the powder metals get polymerised and form a solid hard film. The over sprayed powder is recovered by a separate recovery system attached with the spray booth. Now remove the object from the oven and it is the finished goods. (iv) Quality Specification: The BIS has not prepared any standards for this product, hence this product can be made as per the customers’ requirement. (v) Production capacity: (Per annum) Quantity : 70,000 Sq. mtrs. (vi) Approximate Motive Power: The approximate Motive Power is required 30 KWH. (vii) Pollution Control: This unit does not make so much effluents because the water is used only for cleaning and phosphating purposes. (viii) Energy Conservation: By adjusting the process and utilization of machinery the proper utilization and conservation of the energy can be done.\ (ix) Labour Requirement: 4-5Manpower is required Includes: 2 skilled Labour /Technician 3 Unskilled Labour 4

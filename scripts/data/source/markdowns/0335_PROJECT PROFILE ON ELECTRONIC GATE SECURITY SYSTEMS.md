## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai Project Profile on Electronic Gate Security System Introduction : Electronic product of safety device as an alarm while any person crosses through a gate of any big residence or any building enclosures. Security system of main gate of any big residential building, restricted commercial complex, establishment has been additionally strengthened through sophisticated electronic devices and gadgets. As such, enterpreneurs taking up this project will reap good profit and also make quick return of investment Process of Manufacture: The electrical and electronic components as detailed under the column of raw materials requirement are produced and inspected as a routine quality control inspection. As details in the technical aspects column, suitable PCBs are to be soldered to accommodate all the components in two segments as transmitter and receiver as listed under the raw materials column and to be conneted as per the circuity narrated earlier. The assembled PCBs alogwith separate 9 Volt batteries supply and the alarm with speaker are to be mounted on three separate study insulated bases and terminals for external link may be brought out. All are housed inside their respective moulded PVC bases and screwed properly. The final product is tested and checked. The product is finally packed inside an attractive carton pack with guarantee and card & users manual. a 1 Name of the Product : Electronic Gate Security System 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in Sq.m on rent 100 Rs. 30,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 150,000.00 Portable drilling machine-1, IC Tester Kit-1, Test bench with instrument is fitted on Board -1, Work bench fittes with electrical power sockets-4, Digital multimeter 3-1/2 digit LCD Display AC/DC V/A/Ohm & transistor check features-3, Hand operated DC 500 V Meggar-2, 0-200 micro ohm to 2000 ohm Digital mulli-ohm meter-1, Electrification & installation charges @ 10% cost of m/c equip. cost office furniture typewriter work bench shelves racks.

1. PROJECT PROFILE Introduction and Importance of Physical Fitness India is one of those countries where awareness about health and importance of regular exercise is minimal. Statistics show that inactivity combined with poor diet is second only to tobacco use in causing preventable deaths in the world. The answer to protect from the fatal diseases is not to have treatment, rather to adopt preventive measures through exercise and movement. The evidence in this case is indisputable; Lifelong participation in physical activity has a significant, positive impact on the health and wellbeing of individuals. The sedentary lifestyle is a major underlying cause of death, disease and disability. About 2 million deaths every year are attributable to physical inactivity. A WHO study on risk factors suggested that sedentary life style was one of the 10 leading causes of death and disability in the world. The inactivity also increases the risk of colon and breast cancer, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, osteoporosis, depression and anxiety. Recent studies have shown that children around the world are also becoming increasingly sedentary especially in poor urban areas. Time and resources devoted to physical education are being cut and computer games and televisions are replacing physically active pastime ignoring the fact that the inadequate physical activity in children could have lifelong health consequence. Regular physical activity or exercise with good eating habits, avoiding smoking, monitoring a reasonable body weight and avoiding stress could improve one's health and help prevent from many diseases. Most of the newspapers have no regular columns on health, besides very few programs on physical activity are carried out by the radio and television. Moreover the health sector is also not involved in the promotion of physical exercise. So there is great need to promote activities regarding exercise and fitness.

Good health habits are very important at any age and it is never too late to change habits in ways that will improve health. One of the key factors for increasing health is exercise. A regular program of exercise can:  Aid in weight management  Lower risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer  Increase life span and quality of life  Helps control hypertension and diabetes  Increase and maintain flexibility  Reduces muscles tension  Promotes increased circulation  Aids in relaxation, stress reduction  Develops body awareness 1.2 Opportunity Rationale The factor that leads to the development of this pre-feasibility study is the fact that currently limited people have access to health and fitness clubs under qualified instructors/trainers. Great scope for these types of clubs exist in India especially in urban areas where life is busy and people have less physical activity. 1.3 Project Brief A health and fitness club provides services to its members to improve their physical condition or appearance through exercise. The proposed health and fitness club will provide indoor facilities of Gymnasium, Exercise halls, and a Gym shop & Cafe to male and female members and will offer services of personal training by qualified instructors. Project should be centrally located within a residential town to provide easy access to the inhabitants.

1.4 Proposed business legal status Legal status is recommended to be a sole proprietorship/partnership because it requires less legal requirements. Also the proposed club is a small-scale set-up and almost all such clubs in existing industry are sole proprietorships. Similarly a lower rate of tax is applicable to sole proprietorship than that of companies. 1.5 Project Capacity and Rationale The proposed health club will have an area of 4500sq ft hall having indoor facilities. The club will operate in different sessions of the day like morning, afternoon, evening and night. The club will have a capacity to cater 450 members, spread over in the following different sessions of the day: OOppeerraattiioonnaall sseessssiioonnss Time Slots Duration Gym 6:00 am to 10:30 am (Males only) 4.5 hours 11:00 am to 5:00 pm (Females only) 6 hours 5:30 pm to 10:00 pm (Males only) 5 hours Exercise (Females Only) 11:00 am – 12:00 pm 1 hour (Pilates session) 3:30 pm – 4:30 pm 1 hour (Yoga session) The fee package will range from Rs. 1,500 for exercise session and Rs. 3,000 for gymnasium. The fee is higher due to the reason that proposed club is fully air- conditioned having full range of imported equipment. In addition to these monthly fees each member will pay Rs. 2,000 a non-refundable registration fee and Rs. 5,000 as refundable security. PPrroojjeecctt IInnvveessttmmeenntt Sr.# Description Rupees 1.

 Convenience For new fitness clubs to be a success, it has to be conveniently located. People are more likely to use a facility if it is close to home or work. Also the fitness facility should have hours and class times that work within client’s busy schedule.  Type of Facility There are many different types of fitness facilities, each being the perfect motivational tool for a specific type of person.  Pricing Price levels should be set at affordable levels considering income brackets of people who live in the vicinity and also after considering the competitor’s price levels. 2 SECTOR AND INDUSTRY ANALYSIS 2.1 National Analysis Commercial Health club industry is emerging as one of the good business ventures in India. People are getting conscious and aware about their health and feel the importance of exercise in the busy life. Currently health club industry is segmented and unorganized excluding few health clubs. There is neither an association of these clubs which is working actively for the development of this industry nor government or health department/ministry has collected any data about the quantity and quality of these clubs. Neither have the authorities set any quality standards for such clubs like in developed countries. A lot of people are venturing into this trade, as it is a flourishing business. Competition is healthy but these gyms do not cater to health needs that can be a risk. A lot of people after discontinue the gyms after having complaints of joint pain and other related health issues. This industry has gone through many technological developments. Some clubs use products like heart-rate monitors, calorie expenditure display units etc, to enhance client motivation. They have a complete lifestyle evaluation, which includes blood pressure measurement, resting pulse rate measurement, and body fat assessment before they recruit the new member into the program. Their instructors are certified to give first aid and CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation), so member’s safety is ensured. 2.2 Legal issues regarding industry No approval from any provincial government or health department is required in India for operating a health and fitness club. Health Clubs like any other business activity must be registered with Services tax, income tax department and sales tax department.

3MARKET INFORMATION 3.1 Market potential The market for health clubs in India has been developing steadily over the last decade and a mushroom growth of Gym and clubs is being observed in all the cities. But still a good potential exists for quality health clubs. India is emerging as a newly health conscious society. Location and amenities are some of the most vital factors in the success of a health club. Customers usually conduct research before choosing a fitness facility because choosing a fitness facility that is right for them is crucial to their success. Fitness facilities can vary greatly not only in price but also in size, amenities and programs offered, hours, convenience and most importantly, motivational atmosphere. Many join a fitness facility with the greatest of intentions but end up discouraged and unmotivated due to bad management by the clubs. 3.2 Target customers The target customers for health clubs are the population of big cities having age group of 18 to 50 years. Population of urban areas of India is 33% of total population out of which 50% falls in the targeted customers’ age group. 4 EXERCISE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENT The success of this project is depended on the quality of machines so selection of machinery is the most important aspect of this project. The exercise equipment is available in various varieties. Both local and imported equipment is available in the market. Existing clubs in the market are using a blend of imported (which is locally available) and local equipment. Following is the detail of machinery required for this project.

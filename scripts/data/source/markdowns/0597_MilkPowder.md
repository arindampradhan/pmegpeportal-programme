MILK POWDER PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: The product is rich in calcium as well as other important nutrients, in human diet and are highly perishable. Milk basically provides nutrients like phosphorous, protein, potassium, vitamin A, etc. It is a manufactured dairy product made by dehydrating liquid milk and it passes through various processes until it becomes a powder. Milk powder is the milk that has been dried or desiccated. It can be prepared from whole milk. The composition of dry milk varies according to the composition of the milk of from which it is made.

USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Powdered milk is used in daily life and have several uses which are defined below: ➢ Recombination of milk ➢ Producing milk chocolate in the chocolate industry ➢ Production of ice-cream ➢ Animal feed The product has a wide market all over world. The product is consumed by all age groups and specially by children. The Indian skimmed milk powder (SMP) market has increased at a CAGR of nearly 10% during 2011-2018. It is hereby seen that the demand of the product will increase in near future. INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: 1) Land & Building requirement around 1500-2000 sq. Ft. 2) Office Furniture and fixtures. MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Machinery Requirement are as follows: ➢ Storage Tanks ➢ Feed Pump ➢ Pre-condenser ➢ Spray drier with atomizer ➢ Condenser ➢ Baby Boiler ➢ Chilling Plant ➢ Packing unit ➢ Laboratory testing equipment ➢ Other miscellaneous Equipment’s. Note: Plant Capacity is 500 Kg Per day.

RAW MATERIAL: Basic Raw material requirement are as follows: ✓ Milk ✓ Citric Acid ✓ Magnesium Oxide ✓ Miscellaneous chemicals Nacl, Ca CO3 etc. ✓ Tin Containers MANUFACTURING PROCESS: There is a step by step process for manufacturing of Milk powder: • Separation/Standardization • Preheating • Evaporation • Spray Drying • Packaging & Storage The above process is explained below. • Separation/Standardization: The process starts from procuring the raw material and delivering at the dairy factory then pasteurizing and separating it into skim milk and cream which is done by a centrifugal cream separator. In this little bit of cream is added back to the skim milk so that fat content is also maintained in the milk. • Preheating: After this preheating is performed in which the above milk is heated at temperatures ranging from 75 to 120°C. The milk is constantly heated for a particular time period ranging from a few seconds up to several minutes. Preheating can be done directly or indirectly i.e. through steam injection into the product or via heat exchangers respectively or a mixture of two.

• Evaporation: In this process, the above milk is concentrated in stages. In this the milk is boiled under a vacuum at temperature below 72°C in a falling film on the inside of vertical tubes, and by this the water is removed as vapor. This vapor, is then used to heat the milk. • Spray Drying: In this method the milk is atomized and concentrated from the evaporator into fine droplets. This is performed in a huge drying chamber with appropriate flow of hot air utilizing either a spinning disk atomizer or a series of high-pressure nozzles. After this the droplets of milk are cooled by evaporation by which they never reach the temperature of the air. • Packaging & Storage: The product is immensely more stable than fresh milk but protection from moisture, oxygen, light and heat is needed in order to maintain their quality and shelf life. They are packed into either plastic-lined multi wall bags (25Kg) or bulk bins(600Kg). FLOW DIAGRAM Liquid Mik Separation & Pasteurisation Preheating Evaporation Drying Packing & Storage

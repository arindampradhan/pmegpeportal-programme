Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON ASSEMBLY OF BEVERAGE VENDING MACHINE Introduction : Bevarage Vending Machines were in existence as early as 215 B. C. . The ancient Egyptians were using a device that has been identified to dispense holy water at places of worships after depositing a coin. In the United States, vending machines were introduced in 1888 when the Adams Gum company started to sell their penny gum products using such machines. Vending machines are popular now in India also as one can see them almost everywhere. Vending machines are now an essential equipment at Railway Stations, Airport, Bus Stations, fast-food restaurants, Hospitals, super markets and even in office complexes. 1 Name of the Product : ASSEMBLY OF BEVERAGE VENDING MACHINE 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft rented 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 331,000.00 Digital Multimeter, 41/2 Digit, Temp.

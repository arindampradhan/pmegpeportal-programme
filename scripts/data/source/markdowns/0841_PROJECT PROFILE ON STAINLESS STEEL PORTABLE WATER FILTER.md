(per annum) Value : Rs. 216 Lakhs MONTH AND YEAR OF : February, 2003 PREPARATION PREPARED BY : Small Industries Service Institute Amrit Bhavan, Darrang College Road (W), Tezpur-784001, Distt.: Sonitpur INTRODUCTION MARKET POTENTIAL Portable Water Filters are very The market potential is fairly good as common household utility item now-a- most of the filters available in the market days in all parts of our country. Basically are marketed by Kolkata or Delhi based its function is to filter the micro- manufacturers. The market is rapidly suspended particles from water supplied expanding to sub-urban areas and to our homes which contains such type villages too, where till date the only of particles and makes the water sluggish source of portable water is wells. But and mud coloured. When water is now with the modern living standards, filtered through a ceramic porous water supply system is incorporated in candle, the suspended particles are buildings and to improve the quality, tapped in the candle and filtered water filters are essential. is collected in the bottom part of the vessel, where a tap is fitted to drain water BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS as and when required. 1. The unit proposes to work in one The quality of potable water whether shift of 8 hours with 75% supplied from water supply agencies or efficiency. through bored wells, is generally not good enough to consume. This problem is more 2. The full capacity utilisation can be serious in North Eastern part of our country achieved in one year. where the main constituents which make 3. Interest rate of loans is taken @ water contaminated are oil and iron. The 16% for fixed capital and working use of filters is the only cheapest way to capital. solve this problem and this product is thus 4. The promoter’s contribution is very essential for each house. 25%.

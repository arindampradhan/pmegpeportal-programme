PROJECT REPORT ON BOUFFANT CAPS Bouffant caps differ from surgical caps and are usually preferred for hygiene and safety purposes to minimize contamination. Bouffant caps are designed to provide effective protection to hair from fluids and other contaminants. Standard bouffant caps are made up of non woven polypropylene material and available in one-layer breathable spunbond fabric, as well as three-layer SMS (spunbond/meltblown/ spunbond) fabric. Foodservice outlets and cleanroom manufacturing facilities are the prominent end-users of bouffant caps, followed by the healthcare industry. The growing concern for hygiene at work is anticipated to boost the demand for disposable bouffant caps throughout the forecast period. Bouffant caps are attributed to be one of the prominent segments in the clean room consumables market. Bouffant cap colors are standardized by different authorities as per the area of application. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL Buoffant cap a loose cap, so called because of its puffy shape, typically secured round the head with an elastic, and frequently used in cleanrooms, food service, surgeries, shower and other settings to contain loose hair. The demand for bouffant caps is attributed to boost in the next 10 years owing to their adoption in surgical applications instead of skull caps. In the United States, skull caps were used in surgery by male and female personnel to avoid contamination in the surgical rooms. Skull caps are non-elastic and cover only the upper part of the head.

The exposed hair can lead to severe infections to the patient. Approximately 300,000 surgical site infections (SSIs) occur each year, accounting for about one-third of hospital-acquired infections in the U. S. To overcome this problem, the Association of preoperative Registered Nurses (AORN) authoritatively recommended that bouffant caps be worn by all the team members involved in surgeries. The growing number of foodservice outlets, industrial food processing units, and electronic assembly plants are the key drivers for increasing the demand for bouffant caps at different countries. People highly prefer a hygienic environment at foodservice outlets, which is expected to increase the usage of foodservice bouffant caps. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT Required material For 18” Bouffant cap 1. P. P. Spun Bond Non Woven Fabric (12 Gsm) =130 Rs per Kg 2. Inner elastic =0.30 Rs per meter One Pc Bouffant Cap Weight Non woven fabric 1.73 Grams Elastic 0.57 Gram (20cm) Total weight 2.30 Gram MANUFACTURING PROCESS Non-woven bouffant cap production machine is fully automatic equipment, uses ultrasonic bonding technique to replace the traditional manual sewing with mechatronics automatic control.

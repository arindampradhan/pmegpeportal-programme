Flour Mill 1. INTRODUCTION: Wheat flour, also known as Atta in Hindi, is widely used product on daily basis in every household. For making chapattis, bread, roti, naan, puri Wheat Flour is basic and essential raw material. Most atta is milled from the semi-hard wheat varieties, also known as durum wheat that comprises 90% of the Indian wheat crop, and is more precisely called Durum Atta. 2. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Wheat Flour or Atta is the predominantly used in food items in India, such as chapatti, roti, naan and puri and in sweat items too like halwa, pakoda, etc. This is basic and most essential product for daily consumption in every home in India. 3. DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROMOTER: Do not require any specific qualification. 4. INDUSTRY LOOKOUT AND TRENDS Wheat is the most widely produced cereal all over the world, used for human consumption; Contribution of wheat to energy intake is significant. Global wheat flour market is majorly driven by rising consumption of bakery products fuelled by combined influence of growing population, change in tastes of consumer and rise in disposable income of consumers worldwide. In last few years, there has been a rising demand for wheat flour due to changing trend in food industry with innovations in food products and recipes coupled with changing taste of

consumers. Companies are launching new products, investing in expansion, and forming strategic alliances to increase their market share. The major players in the wheat flour market include Archer Daniels Midland Company (U. S.), Cargill Inc (U. S.), General Mills (U. S.), Ardent Mills Corporate (U. S.) and ITC Limited (India). 5. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Whole wheat flour is used in making Chapaties, Puries, Parotha and other roasted cereal- based products. Sooji / Rava is used in many sweetmeat products. Wheat flour or Maida is a basic raw material for making Bread, Biscuits Cakes and other bakery products. Bran separated on milling is used as cattle feed. The products sold under brand names are very few. The concept for branded cereal flour products is now increasing. 6. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: Basic raw materials required are Wheat Blended of different types. For packing, gunny bags will be required. 7. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Firstly, wheat is thoroughly cleaned such that all dust particles, stones and other foreign matters will be removed. Clean wheat will be tempered before grinding by treating with water so that the bran is separated from the endosperm. The tempered wheat is crushed between corrugated rollers (Break rolls). The first break rolls are set relatively far apart to grind the wheat lightly, while successive break yield finer and finer products. The first break is separated by sieving or bolting in to very fine particles (flour), intermediate particles (middling) and coarse particles (stock). The stock is then sent to second break rolls. This process may continue through 5 to 6 breaks. The stock contains pieces of endosperm and bran and the stock from the last break is principally bran. The middling contains endosperm, bran and germ which are then successively classified and some of the bran removed is sent to reduction rollers. These are smooth rollers, but like the break rolls they are graduated so

that successive reduction becomes finer and finer. After each reduction, sifters separate the flour, middling and stock, this process is continued until most of the endosperm has been removed as flour and most of the bran has been separated in the sifters. 8.

15. STATUTORY / GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been operating several plan schemes for the development of processed food sector in the country during the 10th Plan. One of the schemes relates to the Technology Up-gradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of food processing industries. The Indian food processing industry is regulated by several laws which govern the aspects of sanitation, licensing and other necessary permits that are required to start up and run a food business. The legislation that dealt with food safety in India was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as "PFA"). The PFA had been in place for over five decades and there was a need for change due to varied reasons which include the changing requirements of our food industry.

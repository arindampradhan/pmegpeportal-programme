Introduction: Vermi-compost is a measure produced by composting waste materials by using earthworm. Earthworm digest as low as two percent of the food consumed by it and hence excrete about ninety eight percent of food consumed. The excreta of earthworm is always considered as a natural manure. The modern method of controlled feeding and collection of excreta is known as vermin-composting. It has already become a popular process of manufacturing Bio-fertilizer and in some places like Bangalore municipal waste is processed by Vermi-composting techniques. Advantage : vermicompost product which is about the organic fertilizer made from the worm dropping.: Advantage 1. repair soil PH 2. cheaper than chemical fertilizer 3. Save environment 4. fasten the plant growth 5. give good quality and organic product price Market: With massive propagation of Chemical fertilizer and pesticides in last few decades demerits of such fertilizer and pesticides came into focus of the world. It was found that such fertilizers and pesticides harm not only human health but also the environment and the very soil on which agriculture is done. Alternatives like manure and compost are therefore found to be better fertilizer. Balanced

fertilizer can be achieved by vermi-composting where right balance of N. P. and K can be ensured. Other natural fertilizers find it difficult. Thus vermi-compost is one step ahead in natural fertilizers. By mixing Neem and Tobacco extracts with others vermi-compost can be made to serve properties of fertilizer as well as pesticide. Vermicompost is propagated by Spice Board and Khadi & Village Industries Commission. These Agencies are not promoting NPK Balanced vermicomposting, though it is possible within the technology propagated. Plantations are bulk consumers of vermicomposts. Tea gardens and Rubber plantations in the state prefer bio-fertilizer including compost, manure and vermicompost. Capacity: The unit shall need to work 365 days for three shifts. Worker shall however work for single shift per day, where they will mix the feed in tank, collect and pack vermicompost. As care need not be taken every-day all unskilled workers shall be employed on daily contract basis. The annual installed capacity is estimated at 30 Tonnes of vermicompost. Process: The process of vermicomposting involve preparation of feedstock in vermicomposting pits, mixing them occasionally, collection of excreta of earthworms by brush, sundrying vermicompost to s emi-dry condition, pulverizing and packing. Process Flow: Mixi Collection of Sun- Pulverizin ng excreta drying g of earth warm Pack ing Raw Materials: Though bio-degradable solid wastes of kitchen, farm, etc. enable one to produce vermicompost, these become rich in N but slightly deficient in P & K. Therefore, mixing of materials rich in P & K helps. Also to enhance porosity of the raw materials use of Saw dust/cut hay are done. These are available locally. The unit annually required raw materials will be Rs.2,20,800/- Water: Vermicomposting calls for keeping solid waste mix wet for better health of earthworms. Daily sprinkling calls for 60 Ltrs. of water. Such water is readily available in vermicomposting sites. Power: The process do not call for any power or fuel Manpower: One unskilled person can take care of mixing, collection of vermicompost and its sun drying. Breaking and packing calls for two more unskilled workers. Marketing and accounting shall however call for regular workers. The cost of manpower shall be Rs.31,000/- per quarter. Capital Cost estimate: 1. Land admeasuring 1728 sq.ft. Own 2. Shed and vermicomposting tanks Rs. 40,000/- 3. Water installation Rs. 7,500/- 4. Electrification Rs. 7,500/- 5. Office furniture & equipments Rs. 20,000/- 6. Provision for contingency Rs. 7,500/- 7. Preliminary & pre-operative expenses Rs. 2,500/- 8. Working Capital

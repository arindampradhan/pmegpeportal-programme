ANIMAL FEED MAKING UNIT Introduction: Animal feed is the food given to animals which are domestic often refers to fodder in course of care and management of farm animals by humans for profit. Supply of quality feed ensures the health of animals. Animal feed is the food given to animals which are domestic often refers to fodder in course of care and management of farm animals by humans for profit. Supply of quality feed ensures the health of animals. Various feeds include poultry feed, sheep husbandry, cat food, pet food, pig farming, cattle feeding, dog food, equine nutrition and bird food. Compound cattle feed is an important constituent of ration, considering the fact that dairy animals in India have limited access to cultivated green fodder and grasses. Most of the macro and micronutrients to meet animals’ requirements are provided by compound feed, especially on crop residue-based diets. It is possible to formulate balanced rations for growing and lactating animals only if the feed used conforms to the laid down specifications, for energy, protein, minerals, vitamins, etc. In order to provide animals with necessary nutrients to meet their requirements for maintenance, growth, pregnancy, and production of milk, to reduce the risks of animal health and to minimize excretions and emissions into the environment, the chemical composition of cattle feed used in the diet has to be precisely known.

Uses & Market Potential: Worldwide demand for dairy products is rapidly growing and is projected to increase by 58 % by 2050 compared to 2010, due to the strong demand from an emerging global middle class. The Indian animal feed market is driven by the rising dairy industry, backed by the White Revolution 2.0, which has resulted in the rapid growth of the cattle population. Currently, India has the largest cattle population in the world, thereby becoming a significant market for cattle feed. The demand for commercial cattle feed is projected to increase in India, as the dairy industry structure is becoming more organized and which are aimed at improving the overall status of the animal feed industry to provide for future demand. The Indian animal feed market size reached a value of almost INR 403.5 billion in the year 2020. The market is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% between 2021 and 2026 to reach a value of almost INR 933.3 billion by 2026. The Indian animal feed market is driven by increasing government support in the country. After the liberalization of the Indian economy in the early 1990s, the animal feed industry was presented with new opportunities. The industry continues to have substantial growth potential owing to increasing domestic consumption of animal-based products, rising livestock population, and growing dependence on imports. Product: ANIMAL FEED Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: Grains: Wheat, Maize, oats, sorghum, rice, barley, millets, ragi, etc. Brans: rice polish, De-oiled rice bran, wheat bran, maize bran, etc. Protein meals/cakes: Rapeseed meal/cake, soybean meal, cottonseed meal/cake (decorticated and un-decorticated), groundnut meal/cake, coconut meal/cake,

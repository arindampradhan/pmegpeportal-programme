Formulation Toilet Cleaner is formulated using batch or continuous process of Liquid making. These cleansing products contain different ingredients that are used to improve their cleaning performance. The surfactant plays an important role in improving the cleansing action of liquid by reducing the surface tension of wash liquid. Ingredients some of the important ingredients of Toilet Cleaner includes- Hydrochloric Acid, Novo amine, CTAC, Colour (Acid), Perfume for fragrance, water. Description of Toilet Cleaner Machine Machinery for Toilet Cleaner includes the following: Liquid mixing machine(for mixing of Chemicals) • Filling Machine • Toilet cleaner machines are used to produce Liquid toilet cleaning substance from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span. Toilet Cleaner Current Market Analysis According to “India Toilet Cleaner Market Overview”, the overall market for toilet cleaners is growing with more than 18% CAGR from last five years. The market is further expected to grow with double digits in the next five years. Toilet cleaners are broadly divided into three product types' namely liquid toilet cleaners, in-cistern & rim block and others. Other products include toilet cleaning tablets, powder, spray etc. These are mostly imported in India and have negligible presence in the market.

dominate the market because of low unit prices and age old preference of consumers. As a result, India has a very low penetration of toilet cleaners which provides an attractive opportunity for global and domestic brands. Indian consumers still use proxy products for cleaning toilets such as phenyl, detergents, acids and bleaching powders but with the rising urbanisation These local cleaners, such as phenyl, have a much bigger market than branded toilet cleaners. Toilet Cleaner Manufacturing Process Toilet cleaner is manufactured in a batch of 100 Litre. • Firstly in a 100 Litre Batch, 70% water is transferred into the stainless steel tank manually or through pump. • After that add acid colour into the tank to turn water into blue colour. • Now add Novo amine into the tank (it improve the thickness of the product). • After that start the machine and emulsifier will start working & wait for 20-25 minutes. This leads to blending, dispersing, homogenization and emulsification of fluid liquid material. • Then add CTAC & run it for 10 Minutes again. • After that add 100-200 gram perfume (acid stable perfume) & wait for some time. • Lastly add hydrochloric acid & wait for some time. • Now put the prepared toilet cleaner into the filling machine. • Fill the Toilet cleaner into the bottle & Put sticker on it. • Packaging of product.

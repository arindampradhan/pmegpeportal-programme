PROJECT REPORT ON BABY GARMENTS INTRODUCTION: Gone are the days when parents used to wrap babies in cotton sheets or old / used dupatta. With growing awareness and ambitions, the parents are more than willing to spend a large part of their income & saving on needs of their children. Since arrival of a new baby is a big occasion in the family, the parents and relatives happily spend more and more to pamper the babies. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Baby garments like frocks, T-shirts, Vests, under-wears and articles like face napkins, baby towels and baby blankets are used for clothing and hygiene requirements of new born babies. While there are some gender specific products like frocks or shirts, many textile products for children are gender neutral like blankets, towels, vests, underwear etc.

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK & TRENDS: A baby’s birth is an important event in every family. Not just parents but grandparents, friends and relatives of the blessed family shower baby with various gifts, garments being the most common of these. Strong trend to celebrate baby- shower, baby’s birth and her first birthday has led to growing demand for baby garments. Increasing income levels, growth in ratio of working women and aspiration to give child a better life has also brought a boom in spending on the baby garments. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The main raw material required for baby garment is cotton fabric. While some baby garments can also be made from polyester or blended fabrics, the parents avoid using such products as baby’s skin is generally allergic to man-made fibers and its use may cause rashes or irritation leading to discomfort or disruption in sleep cycles. Even baby blankets and towels are made from cotton knit fabric for the same reason. Cotton knit and woven fabric is available in every major city through fabric dealers or textile mills. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The fabric purchased in roll form is spread in layers on the cutting table. Patterns of various parts of the garment made out of card board or plywood or metal are laid on the fabric in such a way that wastage of fabric is minimized. Several layers of fabric are then cut through vertical motorized blade. Garments are stitched in assembly line manner wherein each machine operator completes only a part of the product. The stitching starts on the 1st machine and gets completed at the last stage where the product is inspected for quality defects if any. Garments are then cleaned of loose yarn or dirt and packed in plastic bags as per customer requirements.

DIATOMACEOUS EARTH POWDER PRODUCTION UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that can be crumbled into a fine white to off white powder. It has a particle size ranging from more than 3 μm to less than 1 mm, but typically 10 to 200 μm. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a silicon dioxide (Si O2·n H2O) mineral made up of fossilized single-celled algae called diatoms. Diatom silica is available from two sources: from culturing diatoms, which is expensive and has limited scalability, and from fossilized Diatomaceous earth minerals available in large quantities from the mineral industry. Depending on the granularity, this powder can have an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and has a low density as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80–90% silica, with 2– 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals), and 0.5–2% iron oxide. Diatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled protist. It is used as a filtration aid, mild abrasive in products including metal polishes and toothpaste, mechanical insecticide, absorbent for liquids, matting agent for coatings, reinforcing filler in plastics and rubber, anti-block in plastic films, porous support for chemical catalysts, cat litter, activator in blood clotting studies, a stabilizing component of dynamite, a thermal insulator, and a soil for potted plants and trees like bonsai. Diatomaceous earth is often processed by grinding, drying, and classifying the material into a powdery dust-like form. The basic processing of DE includes milling, possible purification, drying, and calcination to reduce moisture and make it a fine, talc-like powder, or dust.

2 PRODUCT DISCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Diatomaceous earth powder is used in the FNCG products industry. It may be used to remove unwanted material from drinking water. It is also used as a filler or to prevent the formation of lumps in foods, medicine, paints and plastics, and pet litter. Diatomaceous earth is used as part of various chemical tests. It is also used as an insecticide. Diatomaceous earth is may be used as a source of silica, for treating high cholesterol levels, for treating constipation, and for improving the health of skin, nails, teeth, bones, and hair. Diatomaceous earth can be used to brush teeth and also to remove unwanted dead skin cells. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process is as follows- Raw material procurement Processing Packing Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Preliminary testing of the facility should be carried out by the facility operator to standardize the equipment performance and correct any deficiencies encountered during the testing. The raw material should be stored in a well-organized area. To store raw material and processed products efficiently, can also develop a sound warehouse at infrastructure. Also, to keep a proper track of incoming and outgoing stock can dissect this warehouse in various units. The warehouse should be installed with all the amenities that are required for the safe and easy storage of offered minerals and allied products. Moreover, this warehouse shall be looked after by professionals who will ensure that the required amenities are upgraded on regular basis to ensure that vendors don't have to face any trouble with the storage of products.

Powder Making Process The basic processing of DE includes milling, possible purification, drying, and calcination to reduce moisture and make it a fine, talc-like powder, or dust. 1. Material unloading: Raw material will be unloaded by crusher. Responsible for the quality and safety of products, the process of loading and unloading consists of loading and unloading goods properly. Loads should be spread as evenly as possible, during both loading and unloading. Uneven loads can make the vehicle or trailer unstable. Loads should be secured, or arranged so that they do not slide around. After unloading, material testing will be done. Where chemical and physical tests will conduct. 2. Crushing: After raw material quality testing, the final raw DE is sent for crushing. It will crush bulky raw material in small size. Here DE is crushed by a hammer crusher to the size required which is suitable for grinding it. After that through the elevator crushed materials are put in the hopper for grinding. 3. Grinding: In manufacturing diatomaceous earth from DE stones, the crude is quarried or milled using a grinder. In this process, the raw material will be ground for particle size reduction. The crushed diatomaceous earth is elevated into a hopper by bucket elevator from which the diatomaceous earth is transported through the vibrating feeder evenly and continuously into the grinding chamber for the grinding. The rollers oscillate outward to press the ring because of the centrifugal force and the shovel scoops up the diatomaceous earth, send to the middle between the ring and roller to accomplish the grind. A grinder uses a mechanical action to break the material and reduce it to the powder form or required size. 4. Screening: After this, the ground diatomaceous earth is carried by the air from the blower into the powder separator or vibrator for screening. The fine diatomaceous earth powders are blown into the cyclone powder collector and are poured out through the output-powder valve as the final products, and diatomaceous earth after the screening will be recycled back into the grinding chamber for regrinding. The set’s airflow system is closely sealed up and circulated under conditions of negative and positive pressure. 5. Heating: If moisture is present in powder, then it will take to the oven, and the material will be brought to the proper moisture content.

6. Packaging: After the moisture has been removed the powder is then tested and sent for packaging. The powder will be weighted and it will be packed by a powder packaging machine. A worker will load premade bags manually at regular intervals into the bag infeed magazine, which must be carefully shingled to ensure proper loading into the bagging machine. These bags will then be conveyed to the interior of the machine one by one by a bag feeding roller. The machine measures/weighs the powder product to be dispensed into each bag. The filling head dispenses consistent amounts of the powder product into each bag. And later bag will be zipped or sealed by the same machine. Testing  Quality Control: brightness or whiteness, abrasiveness, absorptive capacity, silica content will be tested. Chemical test, Physical test, Density, Moisture content. Foreign material detection, Powder quality will be tested here. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1,000-1,500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs. 20,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx. 700 Sqft.

 Screener This screener is used to remove fine, ferrous contaminants from dry powder. Circular vibratory screeners can sift, de-dust, and classify a wide range of powders, eliminating any unwanted solids and ensuring consistent and reliable processing.  Moisture Removal Oven This oven is used to remove moisture content from Diatomaceous earth powder.  Powder Packaging Machine This machine is used for automatic weighing and bagging the DE powder. A powder bagging machine is versatile equipment that does two fundamental processes.

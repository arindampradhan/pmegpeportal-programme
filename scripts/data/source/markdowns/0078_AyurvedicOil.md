PROJECT REPORT ON AYURVEDIC HAIR OIL INTRODUCTION Hair oils are composed of oils of vegetable origin as a base blended with small quantities of perfumes. Vegetable oils commonly used are coconut oil, castor oil and sesame oil. Hair oils are also coloured with a view to characterizing different brands and also rendering appeal. Being an item of mass consumption and in view of essentially simple nature of operations, a hair oil unit is an attractive project proposition for budding entrepreneurs. Ayurvedic hair oil consists of herbal extracts in hair oil base, like bringaraj, amala brahmi hair oil etc. Herbal hair oil mainly comprises of oils of vegetable in origin as base and a suitable blended perfume. Vegetable oils commonly used are coconut, caster and seasome oils. To avoid rancidity of hair oils antioxidants are added in very little quantities. Perfumes used for preparation of hair oils should not fugitive and to prevent this they are usually fixed by sandal wood oils or other fixatives.

have special attraction for use of herbal hair oil. The ingredients used in herbal hair oil are Amala dry fruits, Mehandi leaves, Brahmi Plant, Lemon oil. Harar dry fruits, Bahera dry fruits, kapurkachari rhizome , Almond oil etc. The ingredient are used from 0.01 to 1%. The ingredients used are either single or in combinations of two or three or more of the above, as per the consumers requirement. Viz- Amla Hair oil or Brahmi- Amla Hair Oil or Almonds hair oil etc. The base of oils remains same. MARKET POTENTIAL While hair oils are used both by the male and female population, its uses amongst females is comparatively more than with males. It may be conservatively assumed that about 80% of the female and 50% of the male population would use hair oils regularly. Taking population of the north eastern region as 34 million, the population of males and females about 50% each, and considering consumption of hair oils amongst males at 500 ml per year and amongst female at 1000 ml per year, the demand potential for hair oils in the north eastern region is estimated at million litres per year. The market for hair oils is dominated by brands of leading companies like Tatas, Dabur and Hindustan Lever. Local hands can penetrate the market if they are able to sell at a significantly lower price. Although there are a few units producing ayurvedic hair oil, their production is very limited. Assuming that new tiny units can capture 10% of the existing market the demand potential for tiny units is estimated at 1.78 million litres per year which corresponds to about 1500 tons per year of hair oils. Considering the capacity of a typical tiny unit as 30 tons there is scope for over 50 each units to be set up in the region. PLANT CAPACITY A capacity of 30 tons(30,000 Lts) per annum is suggested on the following basis Daily Production - 100 litres Operating days - 300 Annual production - 30 Kilolitres 100 ml bottles - 150,000 nos. 200 ml. Bottles - 75,000 nos. RAW MATERIALS The major raw materials required are coconut oil, castor oil, Sesame oil, perfume, colour. Besides, packing materials including bottles and caps are required. The annual requirement of raw materials is as under :

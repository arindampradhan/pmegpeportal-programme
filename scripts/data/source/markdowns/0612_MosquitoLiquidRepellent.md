MOSQUITO LIQUID REPELLENT Introduction Mosquito repellents are used to repel mosquitoes. Liquid repellents are now widely used to repel mosquitoes. The Liquidator mosquito repellent has a graphite rod in the middle and the bottle is filled with the repellent. There is a heater coil in the liquidator. The repellent chemical when comes in to contact with the heated rod turns into fume which disables the sensors of the mosquitoes. The fumes produced by the repellent blocks the chemo sensors of mosquitoes so that they cannot identify human beings. A mosquito repellent is a substance designed to keep away mosquitoes, thereby preventing them from biting humans and feeding on human blood. It typically contains an active ingredient that repels mosquitoes and secondary ingredients that, among other things, dilute the active ingredient to a desired concentration and help in releasing the active ingredient when needed. Mosquito repellents are available as creams, lotions, oils, and sticks, which are applied directly on the skin. They also come as aerosol and pump-spray products, which are used on the skin and to treat clothing. Mosquito repellents are different from insecticides in that the latter are used to kill insects. Repelling action A mosquito repellent consists of active and inert, or inactive, ingredients. The active ingredient is mainly responsible for the product's usefulness,

that is, it effectively discourages mosquito attacks on the treated human skin and/or clothing. The inert ingredients are not chemically active. They are added to the product to perform different functions. For example, fragrances make the product cosmetically acceptable. Characteristics of Mosquito Repellent  Active against a wide variety of biting mosquitos.  Prolonged activity (remain effective for at least 8 hours between applications).  Non-irritating to the skin and mucous membranes.  No systemic toxicity  Resistant to abrasion, washing and sweating. Factors Impacting world mosquito repellent market  Marketing and positioning strategies  Rise in the demand of Herbal based products  Rise in global temperature  Increasing awareness  Health vulnerabilities  Rising Mosquito borne diseases. Manufacturing process of mosquito repellent Since most mosquito repellents are marketed in the form of liquid, the following steps describe the production of repellents contained in liquid form. The manufacturing process consists of two steps—the production of a large batch of the repellent formula and its packaging into bottles. However, the filling process is not as complex.  Cold blending  Add all the chemicals in proportionate ratio.  Mixing of the all ingredients

 Settling of the mixed material for minimum 6 Hours  Testing of the product.  Filling  Packaging Mosquito repellent Market Analysis With over many species of mosquitoes believed to be responsible for spreading diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and other mosquito related afflictions, India has a large and growing market for mosquito repellents. Many methods are used in households for dealing with the mosquito menace. In spite of the pervasiveness of the mosquito problem, the use of repellents in India is fairly low. The urban share of mosquito repellents is 70%. The mosquito repellent market is one of the rapidly growing vibrant markets in FMCG sector India. Due to increase awareness regarding vector borne disease, the demand for mosquito repellent products like coils, strips, liquid vaporizers, etc. are rising than before, thereby providing high momentum to the Indian Mosquito repellent market. Mosquito Repellent has become a gripping market for new product developments and innovation where producers are trying to convince consumers through aggressive campaign and advertising that they should adopt mosquito repellent products to improve home hygiene and to be protected from mosquito borne disease. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for manufacturing of Liquid repellent:  Mixer tank  Blending machine  Liquid Transfer pump  Filing machine  Packaging machine

 Label machine With the help of this machine the work of formulation (mixing & blending), filling & packaging completes in a very short span. Land &Building required: Land required 1000 square feet Approximate rent for the same is Rs. 20,000 per month. Machinery & Equipment’s required: Name Cost (Rs.) Mixer tank (100 Litre batch production) 1,00,000 Filling machine 1,25,000 Liquid transfer pump with motor 55,000 Blending machine 85,000 Packaging & labelling machine 1,60,000 Sub total 5,25,000 GST @ 18% 94,500 Total Machine cost 6,19,500  Cost of the machine is other than transportation cost. Raw Material Requirement Most common natural repellents used are oils extracted from plants. These natural products will effectively repel mosquitoes, but they require more frequent reapplication (at least every 2 hours). Citronella Oil, Lemon, Eucalyptus Oil, Cinnamon Oil, Castor Oil, Rosemary Oil, Lemongrass Oil,

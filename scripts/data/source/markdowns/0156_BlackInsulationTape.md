PROJECT REPORT ON BLACK INSULATING TAPE Introduction: Cotton selvedge tape for electrical insulation purposes as per IS:1923-1973 and IS:2448 (Part-I)-1963 of Bureau of Indian standards are often referred to as Black Tape. These are used in manufacture of ovens, Furnaces, Motors, etc. and in household electrical wirings & equipments. These are resistant to pressure & temperature. Electrical insulation is the main feature of Black Tapes. It is also used by cable manufacturers to cover conductors. Market: Black insulating tapes are used to cover joints of two conductors and hence an item of everyday use of all electrifications. Joining of more than one cable/ conductor is unavoidable in electrification works and hence Black Tape is a need for electrification works. With massive Electric generation and hence distribution network under implementation in Tripura, therefore, large demand for Black insulating tapes exist. These are sold through all Electrical stores in the state. Installed Capacity: Operating for single shift of 8 hours per day for 300 working days per annum, the unit shall have an annual installed capacity to produce 2.64 Lakh rolls of Black insulation tapes.

Process of Manufacture: The unit will purchase 54 inch wide evenly and firmly woven cotton fabrics, free from weaving defects. Normally the fabric is Black in colour. Rubber compound with 12.50 percent Crepe Rubber, 5 percent National Rubber, 49.50 percent asbestos powder, 12.50 percent Resin, 0.50 percent Carbon Black and 20 percent castor oil are made in Mixing Mill so that the Rubber mix is made into a homogeneous mass. This Rubber mass is mixed with turpentine oil/ Benzene in the same Mixing Mill. This fluid is spread over the cotton fabric in a spreading Machine by using Doctors Blade Technique so that the cost of Rubber solution is uniform. The coated fabric is cut to the required width on a slitting Machine and wound on a winding machine into rolls of desired length. These are then labeled on sides of Rolls and packed in polyethylene. Process Flow Sheet: Mastication Spreading of Winding Slitting Packing & Mixing solution on cloth Sales Raw Materials: The principal raw material of the unit will be petroleum based solvent as double the quantum of all other raw materials taken together shall be solvent. It will be available from Assam Oil Division of Indian Oil Corporation. All other raw materials are available comparatively cheap. The annual requirement at the installed capacity and costs are shown below: Sl. No. Description Quantity required Cost in Rs. 2,55,000.00 1. Benzene 3000 Liters 52,010.00 2.

PROJECT REPORT ON ALUMINIUM CASTINGS PRODUCT AND ITS USES: Aluminium plays a major role in the modern world through its innumerable applications, because of its intrinsic and versatile properties of lightness, strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, electrical and thermal conductivity, non- toxicity etc. In the form of castings, either as cast or heat treated, aluminium is gradually replacing Gunmetal, bronze, stainless steel and many grey iron and malleable iron castings. The typical products and fields of use are mentioned below. Engine components like automobile and diesel pistons, automotive timing gear, gear boxes, crank cases, clutch housing, pump bodies, bracket, arms and hangers for different industries, components, fittings for chemical and marine uses, railways, storage tanks, flywheel housing and propellers, artificial limbs, omamental hardwares, ashtrays, water jugs, art metal work, moulding flasks, core drying plates and pattern castings, rotor of ceiling fans and many other components in different fields are made of A1-castings. MARKET POTENTIAL: It is difficult to assess the exact market for each and every item of Aluminium castings mentioned. However, there is a good demand for the following items in the country:- 1. Moulding flasks 2. Core drying plates 3. Pattern castings. These items are very much required by the ferrous and non-ferrous foundries whose number is increasing day by day. Similarly, the rotor of ceiling fans, which is normally made of grey iron, is now gradually being replaced by Aluminium rotor. Besides, there are many components and fittings made out of Aluminium castings which are very much needed by chemical, marine industries, railways, breweries, electrical industries, pump manufacturers etc. In view of the above the market potential for Aluminium castings is good and also expected to be bright in near future. PRODUCTION TARGETS (PER ANNUM): Production targets is fixed at 120 tones of finished sand mould and permanent mould and permanent mould (gravity die casting) castings of different Aluminium alloys corresponding mostly to LM-5, LM-6, LM-24 etc. per annum. BASIS AND PRESUMPTION: The production target fixed is on the basis of single shift of 8 hours and 300 working days in a year. In this scheme, only sand mould castings and gravity die

casting methods (permanent mould casting methods) are included. The pressure die casting method is excluded since this is covered under reserved item. The process is economical only if the items are mass produced in thousands per day. In the initial phase, the production will be restricted to only such items like- Aluminium patterns, moulding flasks, various components and fittings for chemical; marine and electrical industries, railways, pump housing and rotor of ceiling fans for which there is a good demand. In the 2nd phase, the production of more sophisticated items like automobile and diesel pistons, gear box, crank cases, flywheel housing and propeller etc. will be taken up. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: Project implementation will take a period of 8 months the date of approval of the project. Break-up of activities with time-period for each activity is shown below: Sr. Nature of activities Time period in moths No. (Estimated) 1. Scheme preparation and approval 0-1 2. SSI Provisional registration 1-2 3. Sanction of loan 2-5 4. Clearance from Pollution Control 3-4 Board 5. Placement of order for delivery of 4-5 machinery 6. Installation of machines 6-7 7. Power connection 6-7 8. Trial run 7-8 9. Commencement of production 9 months TECHNICAL ASPECTS: PRODUCTION DETAILS & PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING: 1. The Aluminum alloy ingots along with other additions are melted in oil fired crucible furnace. 2. The molten metal at specified temperature is transferred by crucibles/ladles into the prepared sand mould or permanent mould. 3. The casting are taken out from the moulds when cold and fettled. 4. The fettled castings are inspected and sent for dispatch. 5. The fettlings and rejected castings constitute the foundry returns (generated scrap) and are returned to melting furnace for re-use. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS: In the present scheme, ingots of required specification are selected as raw

material. Accordingly, composition adjustment is normally not necessary. But in using the scrap, composition adjustment will be necessary since during each melting the loss of alloying elements or the bags metal Aluminium has to be compensated by suitable addition of Virgin Aluminium or master alloys. The correct amount of addition can be arrived at only if the bath composition is ascertained by chemical analysis which may take some time. However, control of composition is important and is to be resorted to particularly when the customerâ€™s specification is quite rigid. Melting of Aluminium and its alloys must be controlled as per the norms for a sound casting to be produced. Similarly, quality control of moulding sand with respect to sand grain size, moisture, permeability and green compression strength is equally important. A proper surface either in the sand mould or in the permanent mould for gravity die csting must be ensured for soundness and good surface finish of the casting. Casting alloys selected are those conforming to B. S. 1490, LM-5, LM-6, and LM-24 since these do not require any heat treatment and can be disposed of as cast condition duly fettled.

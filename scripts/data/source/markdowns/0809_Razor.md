RAZOR MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A razor is a bladed tool primarily used in the removal of body hair through the act of shaving. Kinds of razors include straight razors, safety razors, disposable razors, and electric razors. While the razor has been in existence since before the Bronze Age (the oldest razor-like object has been dated to 18,000 BC), the most common types of razors in current usage are the safety razor and the electric razor, though other kinds are still in use. Disposable razors are similar in use and appearance to straight razors, but use disposable blades, either standard double edged cut in half or specially made single edge. These shavettes are used in the same way as straight razors but do not require stropping and honing. Uses & Market Potential: A razor is a bladed tool primarily used in the removal of body hair through the act of shaving. The global razor market size was valued at USD 10.2 billion in 2018 and is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 3.5% from 2019 to 2025. The market is fueled

by several factors, predominantly by growing focus on men’s grooming and rising awareness among consumers related to personal hygiene. Disposable razors account for a significant share in the market and demand for the same will continue to grow thanks to steady usage in developing countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil. Low price and availability of domestic brands are key factors driving product demand in these countries. However, electric shavers, such as epilators and trimmers, are more in demand owing to their durability and easy usage. The online channel is projected to show positive growth in this category owing to easy payment methods and a rise in digitalization across different channels. A recent trend that has made its presence in the grooming and packaging industry is consumer consciousness with regard to the environment. Product: Razor Raw Material: The raw materials required are:  Stainless Steel  Polypropylene (PP) resin  Other Additives: Other additives such as plasticizers, colorants, antioxidants, stabilizers, and fillers.  Packaging Material: Basic packaging material such as clear plastic blister packs, cardboard backing sheet, etc.

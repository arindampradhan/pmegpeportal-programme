BANANA SILK FABRIC MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION Banana is one of the most well-known and useful plants in the world. Almost all the parts of this plant, that are, fruit, leaves, flower bud, trunk, and pseudo-stem, can be utilized. The banana plant's pseudo-stem fibre is similar to pineapple leaf, sisal, and other hard fibres, albeit it is a little more elastic. Musa fibre was once the most popular banana fibre, but the younger inner leaf fibre is coming up fast. The cloth produced from the interior of a banana leaf has several advantages. It's biodegradable, moisture-wicking, wrinkle-resistant, and most importantly, vegan. The fabric is currently expensive and labour-intensive due to the specialized and handcrafted nature of existing banana fibre products. Using traditional handloom methods, the process of converting leaf/stem fibre into fabric is generally electricity-free, resulting in a carbon-neutral product that is also more expensive. Banana “silk” is also less durable than its hemp-like sibling, and requires a light touch much like true silk. Banana fibre is classified as a bast fibre with good mechanical characteristics. However, there hasn't been much research on banana fiber's usage in textiles, and the literature on its use in the fashion industry is sparse.

2. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL Because banana silk is organic and sustainable, it may be utilised as a substitute for a variety of artificial materials. Banana silk is commonly used as a substitute for silk clothing such as shirts, blouses, sarees, gowns, and so on. It's also utilised in needlework, high-end furniture, and cutting-edge fashion. Banana silk is also used for décor and furnishing that include handicraft products like curtains, doormat, wall- hangings, cushions, table mats. India is the world's leading banana producer, accounting for around 18% of the total 139 million metric tonnes produced globally (2012). The main banana producing states are Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Only 10% of the banana stem waste is converted into fibre, despite the fact that banana farming covers over 500,000 hectares. Farmers that choose to send banana stems to these fibre processing machines will not only be clearing waste at no expense, but will also profit from the money they make. The quality of Maharashtra-grown banana stems has been indiscovered to be suitable for extracting banana fibre. When compared to fibres from Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, they are of higher quality and have greater brightness and gloss. Global textiles market is expected to cross US$1 trillion by 2018. India’s share in the market is expected to increase from 12.7% in 2013 to 14.9% in 2018 and to 17.9% in 2023. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT The major raw materials are as follows:  Banana Pseudo Stem  Alkaline Solution

MANUFACTURING PROCESS The banana fiber is very eco friendly, that’s because it is made from the waste products of banana plant which is natural. The process of manufacturing banana silk: - Extraction (manual and machine) - Drying - Spinning and Weaving YIELD OF PRODUCT/PRODUCTION RATIO The production capacity of Banana Silk Fabric Manufacturing Unit can be around 150–200 meter per day. Therefore, the Annual production capacity can be around 45000 -60000 meter per annum. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The land require for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1800-2000 square feet. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs. 30000.00 per month.

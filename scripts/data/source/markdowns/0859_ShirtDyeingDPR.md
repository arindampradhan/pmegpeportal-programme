SHIRT DYEING UNIT Introduction: Dyeing, printing, and coating are the coloration processes to produce beautiful motif and color effect on textile. Printing and coating are limited to surface coloration and may be applied to most of the fiber types, natural fabrics, and synthetics. Approximately 10,000 different dyes and pigments are used industrially around the world. Dyeing and printing are processes employed in the conversion of raw textile fibers into finished goods that add much to the appearance of textile fabrics. Most forms of textile materials can be dyed at almost any stage. The dye used depends on the type of material and the specific requirements to be met. For some purposes, high light fastness is essential; but for others it may be inconsequential. Factors considered in dye selection include fastness to light, reaction to washing and rubbing (crocking), and the cost of the dyeing process. Effective preparation of the material for dyeing is essential.

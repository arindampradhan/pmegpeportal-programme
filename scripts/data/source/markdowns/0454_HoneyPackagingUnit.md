HONEY PACKAGING UNIT Introduction Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance made by bees and some related insects. Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called a honeycomb. The variety of honey produced by honey bees is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharide’s fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (granulated sugar). It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavour when used as a sweetener. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of year. Formulation of Honey Honey is produced by bees collecting nectar for use as sugars consumed to support metabolism of muscle activity during foraging or to be stored as a long-term food supply. During foraging, bee’s access part of the nectar collected to support metabolic activity of flight muscles, with the majority of collected nectar destined for regurgitation, digestion, and storage as honey.

cold weather or when other food sources are scarce, adult and larval bees use stored honey as food. Bees are some of the few insects that can generate large amounts of body heat, thus the hive bees constantly regulate the hive temperature, either heating with their bodies or cooling with water evaporation, to maintain a fairly constant temperature in the honey-storage areas around 35 °C. Important Uses of Honey • The main uses of honey are in cooking, baking, desserts as a spread on bread or as an addition to various beverages. • Honey has been used as a salve to heal burns and prevent infections for thousands of years. • Honey can heal lesions from herpes is an effective topical treatment for both oral and genital herpes. • Honey has a lower glycemic index than sugar, which means it won’t spike your blood sugar levels the way sugar will. Honey also has a sweeter taste than sugar and may help you use less sweetener on foods. This makes honey a better option than sugar. Honey Market Analysis According to the report “Indian Money Market: Industry, Trends, Share, size, growth, opportunity and Forecast 2019-24” The honey market in India was worth INR 15,579 Million in 2018, registering a CAGR of 10.9% during 2012-2018. The market is further projected to reach a value of INR 28,057 Million by 2024, at a CAGR of 10.2% during 2019-2024. Beekeeping has been one of the oldest activities in India. This makes it one of the leading honey markets in the world which has created an intense competition in terms of innovation and cost. Additionally, the demand for honey in India is augmenting on account of the growing consumer preference for natural and healthy alternatives of artificial sweeteners, rising awareness regarding the benefits of honey and increasing popularity of various honey flavours. In addition, owing to its proven anti-bacterial, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, honey is projected to gain a momentum in both the food and non- food applications across the country.

Honey Manufacturing Process Moisture content is the major factor which determines the keeping quality of honey. The optimum humidity for maintaining 17.8% moisture content in honey is about 60%. The processed honey filtered under pressure. Honey should be stored in dry places as it readily absorbs moisture. Uncapping is the first real step of honey processing. It consists of the removal of the thin wax layer that seals the honey cells. The wax caps can be sliced off with a sharp, thin, long knife or special knives heated by steam or electricity. The extraction temperature should not exceed more than 30o C. Extracted, cleaned or purified honey is ready to be consumed directly or to be included into other products. But processing technology does not end other techniques are employed to prepare a product of uniform, constant and agreeable appearance, or to prevent the only possible storage problem fermentation. Description of Honey packaging Unit Final Product obtained in the process of honey packaging unit is then packed as per the International Standards of food processing. Then the product is sealed in such a manner that there should be no leakage from the glass bottles. After that, manual labelling will be done by the workers & the final product is ready to sell in the market.

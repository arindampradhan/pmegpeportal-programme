CORRUGATED BOXES 1. INTRODUCTION Corrugated cardboard is generally used to make packing or shipping containers. Though there are various other types of cardboard boxes available, corrugated cardboard boxes are the most suitable for maintaining the safety of the object it is carrying, especially for long distance shipping purposes. This is because they are made of corrugated paper, manufactured from fiber and is sandwiched by cardboard. This setup makes it very sturdy and ensures the delivery of the articles that it is carrying with zero damage. While some corrugated boxes are made out of plastic, the majority is limited to paper. Corrugated boxes confirm safety and protection of the product being shipped. It also offers durability, cost effectiveness, lightness, strength and recyclability which make it an ideal choice for merchandising and marketing of goods with ease. They are also known to have a good stacking strength. Stacking strength refers to the pressure that is formed during stacking. This is a great advantage for transportation. The stacking strength of the corrugated box also plays a vital role in providing crush resistance and product protection. Corrugated is made of paper and has an arched layer, called "fluting," between smooth sheets, called "liner." This arched layer provides corrugated with a very high strength‐to‐ weight ratio. 2

The corrugated most commonly used to make boxes has one layer of fluting between two smooth sheets. But there are many types of corrugated available, each with different flute sizes and thicknesses. Corrugated Paper boxes are extensively used in the packaging of industrial as well as consumer goods. In some of products like crockery, electronic items, automobile components, glass and cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, soaps & cosmetics, biscuits, hosiery, toys, rubber & rubber products, refrigerator, cooler & fans, proper type of packaging becomes very important. 2. PRODUCTS AND ITS APPLICATION Corrugated is an extremely durable, versatile, economical and lightweight material used for custom‐manufactured shipping containers, packaging and point‐of‐purchase displays, in addition to numerous non‐traditional applications ranging from pallets to children's toys to furniture Corrugated Paper boxes are extensively used in the packaging of industrial as well as consumer goods. In some of products like crockery, electronic items, automobile components, glass and cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, soaps & cosmetics, biscuits, hosiery, toys, rubber & rubber products, refrigerator, cooler & fans, proper type of packaging becomes very important. 3. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK AND TREND Does paper have a future in the digital age? Ultimately, it is a question best answered by the needs of the consumers, but based on the global demand outlook; consumers still want paper well into the 21st century. World demand for paper has doubled in the past 20 years and it is forecast to double again by the year 2020. Per capita consumption of paper & paper board in India at 5 Kg is very low compared to other developing countries like China and Brazil. Therefore, despite the threat of paperless transaction, scope for paper demand appears to be bright. In developed nations it is as high as 160 Kgs per annum. 3

The challenge for the Indian paper industry to meet the ever‐increasing demand of paper, board and newsprint is getting crippled due to shortage of fibers in the country. The future demand of paper is expected to grow from 13 MT at present TO 20 MT in 2020. Demand for cream wove paper and Map litho paper is expected to increase by 7‐8%. Demand for different kinds of coated paper has increased by 8%, duplex board has recorded increase by 6.5%, kraft paper has registered a 6% rise in demand and newsprint an impressive 10%. 4. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY With the steady rise in the industrial production, the demand for corrugated paper boxes increasing every year. These boxes have got distinct advantages such as light in weight, easy to fabricate as per required specifications. The corrugated papers and boards may also find market in the rural areas for packing of fruits, vegetables & eggs. 5. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS  Craft Papers  Glue  Staples wire etc.  Packaging Material 6. MANUFACTURING PROCESS Calculation has been based on single corrugated sheet pasted with one sheet of craft paper. Two paper reels are run together on corrugated machine. One layer of paper becomes corrugated after passing through the heated fluted rolls and other is brought in contact with the former having been glued at the tips. These two get pasted together and are wound in rolls. These will be procured on job work. By cutting this roll with board cutters and gluing the corrugated side on pasting machine. A double face board is produced by the 3rd ply of paper over it. This board is kept under a sheet pressing machines for some time for setting of wet glued sheets. Similarly board to board can be pasted to form thicker board i.e. 5 Ply, 7 Ply and 9 Ply etc. 4

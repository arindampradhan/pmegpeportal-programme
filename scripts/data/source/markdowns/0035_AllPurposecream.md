PROJECT REPORT ON ALL PURPOSE CREAM INTRODUCTION : The function of a skin cream is to protect the skin against harshness from the environment and any dry conditions of the skin. A skin cream should aid the skin in carrying out its normal functions that is, restoring moisture to dry skin, allowing the elimination of waste matter through the pores, and the cooling of the body by evaporation of water (perspiration) and radiation, thus aiding in the maintenance of the normal body temperature. If the cream clogs the pores of the skin with heavy, insoluble, inert material, it results in a thick sticky coating on the skin and prevents sufficient normal skin function, being detrimental to health. Skin creams contain a variety of ingredients that range from common, such as mineral oil, to the exotic, such as placenta extract. Some skin creams may contain small amounts of vitamins or other “nutrients”. A basic and satisfactory skin cream can be prepared from stearic acid, lanolin, mineral oil, triethanolamine, and water. All Purpose Cream is a white viscous cream used to protect skin from dryness & humidity by providing adequate moisturizing effect. It is used in all seasons. 2

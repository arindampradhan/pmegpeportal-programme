NSIC Project Profiles HOLLOW AND CEMENT CONCRETE BRICKS 1. INTRODUCTION Hollow and dense cement concrete blocks known as hollow blocks, have been developed as an alternative to bricks. The products are widely used in construction activity. The hollow blocks are made of cement, stone chips, stone dust and sand are not only cheaper than bricks but have other specialities as well. These blocks have more tensile strength, the walls constructed from these blocks act as thermal insulaters because of their hollowness. 2. MARKET As the construction activity is growing day by day, there is a good demand for hollow and cement concrete bricks. These blocks find wide applicability and construction cost is largely reduced. It is also observed that there is good demand for housing activity among tribals. 3. MANUFACTURING PROCESS Cement concrete blocks can be solid (dense) or hollow. Besides different sizes and designs can be given to the blocks. The blocks are made in the sizes of 12x8x4"; 12x8x3"; 12x8x6", etc. Firstly cement, stone chips, sand, etc are mixed in the ratio of 1:6 or 1:12. This mixture is put in vibrator machine. This is then poured into the desired size mould. After 24 hours of drying, the blocks are put in wter tank for curing. The process of curing continues for two to three weeks to give the blocks compression strength. The blocks are used in construction process after drying. 4. PRODUCTION CAPACITY PER ANNUM Capacity 230000 blocks Selling Price Rs. 6 per block 5. PROJECT COST/CAPITAL INVESTMENT S.

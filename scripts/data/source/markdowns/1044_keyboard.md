KEYBOARD MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: In order to communicate with the computer system we need some input device and an output device. Input device is used to feed data into the computer and output device is required by the computer to communicate the result to the user. Key board is an important part of the computer peripherals. It has provisions for both alphabetic as well as numeric entries. It is basically a data entry medium for the system. The main component of any keyboard is the key switch. These switches convert the typing action into proper signal for the key board interface, so that inter face will know that a key is being depressed. Different technology used to make these switches are: (cid:0) Membrane Technology (cid:0) Mechanical Switches (cid:0) Rubber Dome Switches

Uses & Market Potential: The computer keyboard is important because it is the most effective input tool for letters and characters. Computer keyboards are analogous to the keys on a typewriter. Even if the technology has the ability to create letters and symbols, the keys are necessary to tell it which ones to create. In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface to type text and numbers into a word processor, text editor or other programs. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. The demand for key boards is directly related to the growth of electronics industry, especially computer segment. The expansion of internet facilities even to rural areas has increased the demand for computers in the country. The key board assembly is generally a procured item and most of the renowned computer manufacturers outsource it to vendors in the small-scale sector. It is estimated that 80% of the demand of key boards is met by the small-scale sector. A substantial part is imported. Besides, there is also a great demand of key boards from medical electronics also as most of diagnostics medical equipment now days are based on computer technology and use key boards for data entry. With urbanization and fast growth of industry the demand for such products is ever increasing. Product: Keyboard Raw Material: Raw material that are:  Integrated circuits  Capacitors

 Displays  Noise filters  PCBs  Membrane key tops and Plunger  Housing  Cable connectors  Other electronic components Manufacturing Process:  Raw material procurement  Electronic component assembly  Mechanical sub assembly  Integration  Testing  Packaging Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500-2000Sqft.

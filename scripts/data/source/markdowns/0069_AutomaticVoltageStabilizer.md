PROJECT PROFILE ON AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE STABLIZER INTRODUCTION The Voltage stabilizer provides an output voltage with a specified limit for supplying to load irrespective of wide fluctuation in the input voltage, independent of load power factor and without introducing harmonic distortion. The voltage stabilizer adjusts automatically the voltage variation whether high or low to the proper voltage level necessary for the safe operation of equipments. Excessive voltage fluctuation are hazard to costly electronic and electrical equipments like T. V. sets, VCRs, refrigerators and other scientific and medical equipments etc. Voltage stabilizers are used along with this equipment to protect them from damage due to wide line voltage fluctuations. Market Potential Consumer electronic products are the backbone of the electronic industry in the country. Consumer electronics contributes about one third of total electronics production in the country. Since the item is of great utility of the consumer electronics its demand is growing at a rapid pace in keeping with the increasing production of consumer electronics item.

BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS i. The basis for calculation of production capacity has been taken on single shift basis on 60% efficiency. ii. The maximum capacity utilization on single sift basis for 300 days a year. During first year and second year of operations the capacity utilization is 60% 70% and 80% respectively. The unit is expected to achieve full capacity utilization from the fifth year onward. iii. The salary and wages, cost of raw materials, utilities, rent, etc. are base on competitive rates. These cost factors are likely to vary with time and location. iv. Interest on term loan and working capital loan must be preferably current rate. Otherwise, the rate of interest on an average may be taken as 11.50%. This rate may vary depending upon the policy of the financial institutions/agencies from time to time. v. The cost of machinery and equipments refer to a particular make / model and prices are approximate. vi. The breakeven point percentage indicated is of average capacity utilization. vii. The project preparation cost etc. whenever required could be considered under pre-operative expenses. viii. The essential production machinery and equipment required for the project have been indicated. The unit may also utilize common test facilities available at Electronics Test & Development Centers (ETDCs) and Electronic Regional Test Laboratories (ERTLs) and Regional Testing Centers (RTCs).

V. Pollution Control The Govt. accords utmost importance to control environmental pollution. The small-scale entrepreneurs should have an environmental friendly attitude and adopt pollution control measures by process modification and technology substitution. India having acceded to the Montreal Protocol in sept. 1992, the production and use of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) like Chlorofluore Carbon (CFCs), Carbon Tetrachloride, Halons and methyl Chloroform etc. need to be phased out immediately with alternative chemical/solvents. A notification for detailed Rules to regulate ODS phase out under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 have been put in place with effect from 19th July 2000. The following steps are suggested which may help to control pollution in electronics industry wherever applicable: i) In electronic industry fumes and gases are released during hand soldering / wave soldering/Dip soldering, which are harmful to people as well as environmental and the end products. Alternate technologies may be used to phase out the existing polluting technologies. Numerous new fluxes have been developed containing 2-10% solids as opposed to the traditional 15-35% solids. ii) Electronic industry uses CFCs, Carbon Tetrachloride and Methyl Chloroform for cleaning of printed circuit boards after assembly to remove flux residues left after soldering, and various kinds of foams for packaging. Many alternative solvents could replace CFC-113 and methyl Chloroform in electronics cleaning. Other Chlorinated convents such as trichloroethylene, per chloroethylene and methylene chloride have been used an effective cleaners in electronics industry for many years. Other organic solvents such as ketenes and Alcohols are effective in removing both solder fluxes and many polar contaminants.

VI. Energy conservation With the growing energy needs and shortage coupled with rising energy cost, a greater thrust in energy efficiency in industrial sector has been given by the Govt. of India since 1980s. The energy conservation Act 2001 has been enacted on 18th August 2001, which provides for efficient use of energy, its conservation & capacity building of Bureau of Energy Efficiency created under the Act. The following steps may help for conservation of electrical energy: i) Adoption of energy conserving technologies, production Aids and testing facilities. ii) Efficient management of process/manufacturing machineries and system, QC and testing equipment for yielding maximum energy conservation. iii) Optimum use of electrical energy for heating during soldering process can be obtained by using efficient temperature controlled soldering and disordering station. iv) Periodical maintenance of motors compressors etc. v) Use of power factor correction capacitors. Proper selection and layout of lighting system; timely switching on-off of the lights; use of compact fluorescent lamps wherever possible etc. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION a. The project profile may be modified/ tailored to suit the individual entrepreneurship qualities/capacity, production programme and also to suit the locational characteristics, wherever applicable. b. The Electronics Technology is undergoing rapid strides of change and there is need for regular monitoring of the national and international technology scenario. The unit may, therefore, abreast with the new technologies in order to keep them in pace with the developments for global competition.

c. Quality today is not only confined to the product or service alone. It also extends to the process and environment in which they are generated. The ISO 9000 defines standards for quality Management System and ISO 14001 defines standards for Environmental Management System for acceptability at environment level. The unit may therefore adopt these standards for global competition. d. The margin money is 10% of the working capital . However the percentage of margin money may vary as per PMEGP guidelines

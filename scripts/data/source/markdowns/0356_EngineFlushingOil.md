ENGINE FLUSH OIL UNIT Introduction: An Engine Flush is an oil product that is intended to remove the Sludge and Heavy deposits that may have built up in the engine from the oil. So, they remove those deposits from the internal combustion engines of cars that have covered more than 120, 000 Km or 75, 000 Miles. All the Engine flush products are aftermarket solvent packages and a majority of them are easy to use. They are added to the Engine oil through the oil-filler port and then the engine is idled for 10 – 15 minutes. This gives time for the flush to mix with the oil, travel with the oil to the areas where there are sludge and deposits and then dissolve them thus cleaning them. The oil is then drained along with much of the oil sludge that the flush was able to dissolve. The oil can now be changed and the oil filter can be replaced after that.

Engine flushes reaches those parts of the engine that are hard to clean. 3. It keeps the motor oil clean. 4. Improves the fuel economies of the machines The global Engine Flush market is a part of the Automobile Parts Cleaner and Degassers and the market for the same was valued at USD 38.2 Billion in 2017 and is expected to reach a value of USD 47.5 Billion by 2024 growing at a rate of 3.5 % in the forecast period of 2019 – 2025. The purpose of the Engine flush is to clean the entire lubrication system of the machine and thereby it helps in enhanced performance of the machine or vehicle.

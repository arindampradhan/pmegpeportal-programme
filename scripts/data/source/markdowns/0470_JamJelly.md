JAM & JELLY Introduction Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savoury preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, "preserves" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies. Jam typically contains both the juice and flesh of a fruit or vegetable, although one cookbook defines it as a cooked and jelled puree. The term "jam" refers to a product made of whole fruit cut into pieces or crushed, then heated with water and sugar to activate its pectin before being put into containers. Jelly refers exclusively to a clear or translucent fruit spread made from sweetened fruit (or vegetable) juice—thus differing from jam by excluding the fruit's flesh—and is set by using its naturally occurring pectin, whereas outside North America jelly more often refers to a gelatin-based dessert, though the term is also used to refer to clear jams such as blackcurrant and apple. In the United Kingdom, redcurrant jelly is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or Sunday roast. It is a clear jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining. Formulation Pectin is essential to the formation of Jam & jelly because it acts as a gelling agent, meaning when the pectin chains combine, they create a network that results in a gel. The strength and effectiveness of the side chains and the bonds they form depend on the p H of the pectin.

Characteristics of Jam & Jelly 1. Jam and fruit preserves are made from fresh, frozen, concentrated, or previously canned fruit that is cooked with sugar (and added pectin, if required), until enough water has evaporated and it gels. The total soluble solids (TSS) should be > 65%. 2. Jellies are gelatinous, clear, and made from fruit juice and sugar, texture is firm, and it holds its shape. The TSS should be > 65%. 3. Marmalade is made from citrus fruit—sliced or diced, suspended in clear jelly. 4. Lower In fat. Description of Jam & Jelly Machine Following machines are required for Jam & Jelly manufacturing unit. 1. Pulper Machine 2. Slicing Machine 3. Juice Extractor 4. Steam Jacketed Kettle 5.

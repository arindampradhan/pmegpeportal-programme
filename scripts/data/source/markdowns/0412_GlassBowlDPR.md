GLASS BOWL UNIT Introduction: Glassware is defined as the articles which are made from different types of glass, such as, soda-lime glass, lead glass, and heat resistant glass. Glassware is used for containing food or decorative purposes. A Glass bowl is a round dish or container typically used to prepare and serve food. The interior of a bowl is characteristically shaped like a spherical cap, with the edges and the bottom forming a seamless curve. This makes bowls especially suited for holding liquids and loose food, as the contents of the bowl are naturally concentrated in its center by the force of gravity. The exterior of a bowl is most often round but can be of any shape, including rectangular. The size of bowls varies from small bowls used to hold a single serving of food to large bowls, such as punch bowls or salad bowls, that are often used to hold or store more than one portion of food.

Uses & Market Potential: Use of multicolored glass lends a charming and luxurious look to kitchen utensils. Glass utensils are absolutely classy and must possess for each contemporary home, hotel and restaurant . The global glassware industry is positively impacted by a recent change in buying behaviour of consumers who are increasingly favouring premium homeware products. Moreover, the availability of trendy glassware products is favouring the overall industry growth. Increasing disposable income of consumers from developing nations such as China and India is resulting in strong demand for luxury and premium glassware products. The rapid increase in the hotel and catering industry around the globe is one of the significant factors which are propelling the growth of the glassware market. This trend is observed after the growing popularity of dinner out among the working class of the population segment. Market penetration of cafeterias and beverage bars is further fueling market growth. Recent scientific studies have confirmed the benefits of using glass utensils in terms of elimination of bacteria as these products do not have pores. This has resulted in elevated interest from health-conscious consumers into glassware. Aesthetic appeal of glass products is one of the parameters for consumers to consider buying them. The soda lime glass segment expected to grow at the fastest rate of 12.4% CAGR during the upcoming years. Product: GLASS BOWL Raw Material: 1.

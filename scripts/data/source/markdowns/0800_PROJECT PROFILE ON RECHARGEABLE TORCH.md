## Page 1

Khadi and Village Industries Commission Mumbai PROJECT PROFILE ON RECHARGEABLE TORCH Introduction : Rechargeable Torch is the Torch which operate with the help of storage battery, which can be recharged with the help of Electricity. This torch is handy and produces more illumination in comparison of convertional torch, which worked with the help of dry cell battery. The operating cost of rechargeable torch is very - very less, if we compare with running cost of dry cell battery torch. Once it is fully charged, the same works for 14 hours continuously without any interruption. It is available in the market in different shapes and models, and the average life is opprodximately or 2 years, and after 2 years, one has to replace the battery only. It operates at 6 volts and battery is charged by Electricity after contineous operation. operation 1 Name of the Product : RECHARGEABLE TORCH 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft rented 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 83,000.00 Drill machine 3/4"/Testing boad with Voltmeter,Ammeteretc./Megger O-500 Volt/Multimeter/Hyderometer/High Voltage Tester/Tools,Dies,jigs etc.,/Office equipment &Furniture/Preoperative expenses.

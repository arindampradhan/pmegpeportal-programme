PALM OIL PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: The most widely used vegetable oil in the world is palm oil. Palm oil is made from the pulp of the oil palm tree's fruit (Elaeis Guineensis). Because of its high beta-carotene content, this tropical fruit has a reddish color. It's the size of a large olive. Palm kernel oil is made from the fruit's single seed or kernel. The oil content of each palm fruit is approximately 30-35 percent. The fatty acid composition of palm fruit oil and palm kernel oil differs significantly, but they share the same botanical origin. Palm oil and palm kernel oil represent 32 per cent of the global vegetable oil production. Palm oil can be used as crude oil or as refined oil. Only one-quarter of the palm oil and palm kernel oil worldwide is used as crude oil. Crude palm oil is commonly used for domestic cooking in Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of Brazil. Many food products, such as margarine, confectionery, chocolate, ice cream, and bakery products, use refined palm oil as an inexpensive ingredient. It is also present in non-food products like soap, candles, and cosmetics. Uses & Market Potential: Palm Oil vegetable edible oil extracted from the mesocarp of an oil palm fruit. In 2019, the size of the Palm Oil market is projected at $81.9 billion and in the 2020-2025 forecast periods at the CAGR by 6.0%. Two types of oil can be produced, crude palm oil comes from squeezing the fleshy fruit, and palm kernel oil which comes from crushing the kernel, or the stone in the middle of the fruit. It is free of cholesterol and easy to digest and high in carotenoids and vitamin A. Palm oil offers various health

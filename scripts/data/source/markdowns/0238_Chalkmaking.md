CHALK UNIT Introduction Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or Ca CO3. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint). Chalk as seen in Cretaceous deposits of Western Europe is unusual among sedimentary limestones in the thickness of the beds. Most cliffs of chalk have very few obvious bedding planes unlike most thick sequences of limestone such as the Carboniferous Limestone or the Jurassic oolitic limestone. This presumably indicates very stable conditions over tens of millions of years. Chalk has greater resistance to weathering and slumping than the clays with which it is usually associated, thus forming tall, steep cliffs where chalk ridges meet the sea. Chalk hills, known as chalk downland, usually form where bands of chalk reach the surface at an angle, so forming a scarp slope. Because chalk is well jointed it can hold a large volume of ground water, providing a natural reservoir that releases water slowly through dry seasons. Properties of Chalk One of the most important physical properties of chalk is its ability to store water. For industrial purposes, chalk makes a good fertilizer and cement-maker. Its permeability allows easy molding and tunneling, and its softness is useful in writing utensils. Chalk decomposes with the application of heat, and can be used in the preparation of steel with lead ores and smelted copper. It has medicinal uses to help people with diarrhea, and is used by gymnasts and weightlifters to increase friction between surfaces. Before the Industrial

Revolution, chalk was used extensively in water wells because of its permeability, which makes it a great aquifer. Description of Chalk Machine Machinery for Chalk Unit includes the following: Chalk Machine  Drying Oven  Aluminium Mould  Chalk Machines are used to produce chalk substance from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation completes in a very short span. Chalk Market Analysis The chalk, salt, gravel, and other natural resource industry is growing exponentially all around the world. Danish companies, for example, as well as other international companies assist in the extraction of these natural resources. Chalk can be found around Danish territories. Chalk is found in the Danish underground. In addition, many leading producers, like Denmark, will continue to exploit the vastly useful resource. Chalk Manufacturing Process  First step is Quarrying Limestone.  Pulverizing the chalk  Dehydrating Gypsum.  Shifting  Cleaning  Adding water to foam thick Slurry  Mixing  Extrusion from the die.  Cutting into desired pieces.  Packaging of goods.

OFFSET PRINTING INTRODUCTION Offset Printing is the latest method of printing system in any language. The method of printing in earlier days was by rotary printing press in which the matter to be printed was to be first composed manually. In Offset printing, the matter which is to be printed is fed into the computer and after that with the help of the camera, it is exposed and film is prepared through developer/chemicals and put into Offset printing Machine to take out the print. Offset printing method is the latest one where the quality of printing is very fine in comparison to the previous method.

MARKET POTENTIAL Today is the age of technology. Offset Printing Press is the example of new technology. The required material may be printed in minimum time with good accuracy and better quality. Now a days, the number of schools, colleges, offices and other business activities is increasing day by day. They require stationery, books and other printed materials. Therefore, Offset Printing Press has very good scope, particularly in Urban and semi–Urban areas. BASIS AND ASSUMPTIONS i) This report is worked out on the basis of 50% capacity utilization on Single Shift and 300 working days per annum. ii) The machinery and equipment are of standard make. iii) The cost of raw materials and other expenditure is approximate and based on current market rates. iv) The period for achieving envisaged capacity utilization is estimated to be one year after commencement of production. v) Interest rate for fixed and working capital has been calculated @ 11% per annum. vi) Payback period would commence immediately and the repayment period is estimated at 5 years. IMPLEMENTATIONSCHEDULE 1. The entrepreneur has to arrive at a decision in order to select this product. The guiding factor in this regard would be the market potential, demand and supply gap and availability of resources. It may take 2 to 3 weeks’ time. 2. After selecting the product, the entrepreneur has to get provisional registration from DIC, so that he can apply for allotment of land, power, etc., for which about one-week time is required.

3. In order to obtain financial assistance from the financial Institutions, like Commercial Banks or State Financial Corporations, a detailed Project Report is required to be prepared. On the basis of the report, financial institutions may take 8 to 12 weeks time for sanctioning and disbursing the loan. Accordingly, orders for plant and machinery may be finalized and placed. Simultaneously, order for purchase of raw materials is also to be finalized and recruitment of key staff is to be done. This would require 3 to 4 weeks’ time. TECHNICAL ASPECTS Process of Manufacture Composing of matter which is to be printed, is done on computer with the help of special Software’s such as Corel Draw, Photoshop, MS Office, Page Maker, etc., Thereafter a film is produced with the help of a camera. This film is called negative. The matter, which is to be printed is taken on this film/negative. The negative and an aluminium plate are put into the printing down frame/exposer. Before starting the exposer, the pre-setting of timer is done in the timer/watch. Generally, it takes approx. 200 seconds for making positive. The time exposer is switched off automatically as soon as positive has been built up. The image of negative is printed on the aluminium plate, which is called positive. After that, the developer is spread on the plate followed by washing with the fresh water. During this process, the matter gets printed on the plate automatically. Thereafter, the aluminium plate is fitted in the offset printing press. This plate is called P. S. Plate, when it is used for first time and thereafter it is called Y-pon Plate. The papers are cut on Paper Cutting Machine. Then the papers are fed one by one into Offset Printing Press. Generally, the capacity of offset printing press is 4000 impressions per hour. Quality Control and Standards As per Customers’ requirements.

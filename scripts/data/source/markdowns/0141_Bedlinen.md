PROJECT REPORT ON BED LINEN INTRODUCTION: Bed Linen comprises of articles made out of fabric and used in bed like bed sheets& pillow covers (also known as Pillowcase). Bed sheets are used for spreading on the bed. Sometimes two bed sheets are stitched together to form a sandwich sheet called Dohar. Such a sheet becomes thicker, traps air inside and works as a very light blanket. However, usage of Dohar in India is limited to certain States only. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Bed sheets come in different weaves, sizes, colors and prints. The major classification is Single bed sheet and Double bed sheet. Various sizes are available in double bed sheet like Regular, Queen, King etc. matching the size of

bed and mattress. Hospitals and Hotels usually use white bed sheets and pillow covers. Single bed sheets come in one size only although single beds used by Hotels, Hospitals, Hostels and kids vary in size. Bed sheets are used for spreading on the mattress to give the bed a better look and to protect the mattress. Similarly, a pillow cover enhances beauty of the pillow and also protects it from soiling over long run. Bed sheets and pillow covers are made out of woven fabric of cotton or blended fibers. Cotton fabric is preferred in warm weather because of its moisture absorption property although it is expensive compared to blended fabrics and also gets more wrinkles and therefore frequent washing and ironing. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK & TRENDS: Bed linen is a necessity. Continuous rise in disposable income of the families leads to a robust demand for such products and the trend is bound to continue for several years. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: Bed sheets and pillow covers of different cost and quality are used in each household. Growing awareness about cleanliness and hygiene has also led to higher demand for clean and crisp bed linen in Hospitals, Railways, Hotels, Hostels and such other institutional buyers. Improving income levels has also fueled people’s aspiration to buy quality bed linen to enhance their home décor. The market is growing continuously in line with population & income levels. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The main raw material is cotton or blended fabric of varying quality which is easily available in grey and dyed forms. Printed fabric is also used in some made ups. Fabric quality is generally expressing in terms of Thread Count (TC) which means a sum total of warp and weft threads in one square inch of the fabric. Although

## Page 5

general perception is higher the TC better the quality, it may not always be true because quality of each thread or yarn also matters quite a bit which in turn depends on quality of the fiber used in yarn. Fabrics of multiple thread counts,colors and prints are easily available throughout India. Since a double bed sheet is 9 to 10 feet wide, fabric of wide width (120”) is normally used in bed linen. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The fabric purchased in roll form is spread in layers on the cutting table. Patterns of various bed sheets or pillow covers made out of card board or plywood or metal are laid on the fabric in such a way that wastage of fabric is minimized. Several layers of fabric are then cut through vertical motorized blade. Bed sheets and pillow covers are stitched in assembly line manner wherein each machine operator completes only a part of the product. The stitching starts on the 1st machine and gets completed at the last stage where the product is inspected for quality defects if any. Sometimes pillow covers are sent for further work like embroidery, special patch-work, border etc. Products are finally cleaned of loose yarn or dirt and packed in plastic bags as per customer requirements. Bed linen is sold in sets as well as individually. STATUTORY/ GOVERNMENT APPROVALS The project does not require any specific government approval. Registration with MSME is optional. An Entrepreneur may be required to obtain Shops & Establishment Registration and Professional Tax registration by local Municipal authorities. Registration under Factories Act, Provident Fund Act and ESI provisions would be required depending upon the number of employees, the location, the level of mechanization and the age of the enterprise. Entrepreneur may contact State Pollution Control Board where ever it is applicable.

BACKWARD ANDFORWARD INTEGRATION: As the machines used in the project are versatile, the Entrepreneur can also consider manufacture of other articles like bags, wall hangings and garments etc. depending on opportunities in the market he / she is familiar with. Disclaimer: Only few machine manufacturers are mentioned in the profile, although many machine manufacturers are available in the market. The addresses given for machinery manufacturers have been taken from reliable sources, to the best of knowledge and contacts. However, no responsibility is admitted, in case any inadvertent error or incorrectness is noticed therein.

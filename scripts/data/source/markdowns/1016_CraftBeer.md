1. INTRODUCTION Brewing has been practised since the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence shows that ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia were among the first civilizations to do so. Cuneiform (the oldest known writing) from ancient Mesopotamia contains descriptions of several beer recipes. The brewer's skill was the only occupation in Mesopotamia that had social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, especially Ninkasi, who oversaw beer production, Siris, who oversaw beer consumption, and Siduri, who oversaw beer enjoyment. Women are typically the primary brewers in pre-industrial eras and in underdeveloped nations. A craft brewery, sometimes known as a microbrewery, is a brewery that produces modest volumes of beer, generally less than big breweries, and is typically operated by a single person. Breweries of this kind are known for emphasising excitement, innovative tastes, and a wide range of brewing processes. Although traditional artisanal brewing had existed in Europe for centuries and had extended to other nations, the micro brewing movement emerged in the 1970s in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The more inclusive idea of craft brewing evolved as the movement progressed and some brewers increased their output and distribution. A brewpub is a bar that brews its own beer and sells it on site. Malt, water, hops, and yeast have been used to make beer for millennia. To put it another way, the sugars in grains are extracted so that yeast may convert them

to alcohol and carbon dioxide, resulting in the ultimate product: beer. While craft brewing is governed by scientific principles, it also requires creativity, since brewers must experiment with different mixes of grains, hops, yeast, and extracts to create a variety of styles. Craft beer is distinguished from mass-produced beer by its commitment to innovation. To decrease the price of the finished product, the main domestic beer producers utilise less expensive components, such as rice or maize instead of hops, resulting in a watery, bland beverage. There are a number of beers that readily fall into the 'craft beer' category. Even if a brewer is tiny, traditional, and independent, he or she might still create a poor beer. We've tried a lot of them, so trust us. They are somehow more respected because they are craft brewers, but they still make lousy beer. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Craft beer has a more complex and unique flavour than mass-produced beer. The majority of craft brewers are passionate about their beer's taste and flavour. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Beer is more than just water, hops, malt and yeast. In the beer making process various ingredients are mixed, processed and sometimes the structure of the raw materials is altered. The brewing process is made up of ten production steps from the fresh barley to the finished beer –steps in more detail mentioned below.  Malting: Malting is the first stage in the manufacture of beer. Fresh barley is first soaked in water before being placed in so-called germination boxes to sprout. The enzymes (amylase) required for starch separation are produced during this phase. The drying process then interrupts the germination process at just the right time (kilning). The green paints are meticulously dried at 80 degrees Celsius and have a somewhat pleasant flavor when dry. The malt sugar is subsequently used to feed yeast cells, which produce alcohol.  Milling: Milling is the second step in the brewing process. The final malt is milled, similar to how wheat is made, to improve its water absorption. Malt mills generate a variety of

crushed malt grades, including husks, groats, meal, semolina, and powder (from the coarse to the finest).  Mashing: Mashing is the third step in the brewing process. In the mash procedure - mashing- in - the milled malt is combined with water. Sugar, protein, and tannin are released as the starch in the grist dissolves. This mashing procedure yields the so-called malt extract.  Lautering: The loudest phase in the beer-making process is the fourth. In the lauter tun, the mash is filtered as the husks sink and the liquid is separated from the solids (spent grains). The term is then utilized in the brewing process, with the wasted grains often being used as cattle fodder.  Sparging: Water is added during lautering to extract more of the fermentable sugars from the grain.  Word Boiling: Boiling is the fifth step in the brewing process. The word is boiled and the hops are put in the brewing pan or word kettle. The kind and number of hops used determine the beer's flavour: the more hops used, the bitterer the beer. The word is condensed to the original word when the water evaporates, the malt enzymes are deactivated, and tannin and protein components are separated to create the so-called trub.  Word Classification: Word clarity, also known as drawing off, is the sixth phase in the brewing process. The word is then fed into the vortex, which begins to revolve. Hop particles that haven't dissolved and protein, known as trub, create a cone in the centre of the container, and the clear word may be tapped off to the side. The clear word is then cooled to between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius in the word cooler.  Fermentation: The alcoholic fermentation process is the seventh phase in the beer-making process. This takes place in a fermentation tank with the addition of specific brewing yeast. The malt sugar is converted to alcohol and carbon dioxide by the yeast. The yeast sinks and is collected as soon as the malt sugar has fermented. A top or bottom fermented beer is created depending on the type of yeast and the word preparation employed.  Conditioning: The yeast in beer goes inactive throughout the conditioning process and settles out of the brew, accumulating at the bottom of the tank. Any residual yeast and big proteins are subsequently filtered out of the brew.  Filtration: Filtration is the ninth step in the brewing process. Any components left over after fermentation and secondary fermentation, including as yeast particles, hop resin, and protein, are removed at this stage, and the beer is given its final clear color.

 Packaging: The beer is bottled once it has finished conditioning. Beer comes in a variety of containers, including bottles, cans, and kegs. Brewers commonly forcibly carbonate their beer prior to packing since CO2 is allowed to escape during the fermentation process owing to the building of pressure, which may cause the tanks to explode. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1000 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 500 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Malt Mill: Brewery malt mills (malt crushers) are devices that squeeze malt grains finely without harming the grain's outer layers.

## Page 7

 Mash tun- Mash tuns are important parts of a brewhouse because they mix grain that has been cracked in a grain mill with metered hot water to convert complicated starches into more easily fermentable simple sugars.  Filtration system- For basic, medium, and fine beer filtration, kieselguhr filters are the most often used method. The filtering media is diatomaceous earth (kieselguhr). This is a coarsely crushed combination of ancient seaweed shells.  Heat exchanger- A heat exchanger is a brewery piece of equipment that swiftly raises or lowers the temperature of wort or beer.

## Page 8

 Beer fermentation Tank- Fermentation Containers, commonly known as fermenters or FVs (and sometimes written fermenters), are the tanks, barrels, or other vessels in which wort ferments into beer.  Kiln- Kilning is the process of drying and developing malty, biscuit-like tastes from sprouted barley. Pale malt makes up the majority of malt in today's beers.  Lauter Tun- The Lauter Tun is a vessel used to separate the wort from the mash solids. It usually has a false bottom with a slotted, perforated floor that retains the spent milled grains while enabling the wort to filter through the grain bed and gather in the area beneath; the wort then flows to the brew kettle.

TERRACOTTA POT MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Terracotta is a type of ceramic pottery. It’s used to make many flower pots. Terracotta is also often used for pipes, bricks, and sculptures. Terracotta pottery is made by baking terracotta clay. In fact, the word “terracotta” comes from the Italian words for “baked earth.” Makes sense, right? You may also hear “terracotta“ used to describe color. The terracotta color is a natural brown-orange. Terracotta clay is easy to sculpt into all sorts of shapes. Once shaped, it’s heated to 1,000- 2,000° F to harden. Then, a simple coat of glaze can make terracotta watertight. Terracotta has been around for a long time. In fact, it was the only clay product used until around the 14th century. Archeologists have found terracotta sculptures that are 5,000 years old. Uses & Market Potential: Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware, and also for various practical uses including vessels (notably flower pots), water and waste water pipes, roofing tiles, bricks, and surface embellishment in building construction. The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta, which varies considerably. The global earthenware market is expected to drive on account of increasing generic fashion in home decorations. It is made from ceramic material and is

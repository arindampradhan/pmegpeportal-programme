1. INTRODUCTION Coconut is the fruit of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). Coconuts have been grown in tropical regions for more than 4,500 years but recently increased in popularity for their flavor, culinary uses, and potential health benefits, The Coconut Tree is called the Tree of Life” because all the parts of the entire tree–from top to bottom–are used to sustain human life. The composition and chemical properties of coconut honey is suitable for long-term storage, and is easily assimilated even after long preservation. Coconut honey immersed in honey have been preserved for centuries. The key to preservation is limiting access to humidity. The coconut tree provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses. The inner flesh of the mature seed, as well as the coconut milk extracted from it, form a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid, called coconut water or coconut juice. Mature, ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds, or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  Coconut honey prevent ailments related to digestion such as stomach pain, gastritis, bloating, acidity.  Coconut honey contain antioxidant that dissolve the stone gradually in the kidney.  Coconut honey has the ability to strengthen the muscles of the heart and lower blood  pressure.  Coconut honey contain large amount of potassium is a healthier option to improve energy level.  Coconut honey has the ability to slow down cell degeneration and prevent premature Ageing. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL The raw material for coconut honey requires sap of coco nut tree along with some solvents are used during the manufacturing of honey. Grated wet coconut kernel good quality oil as well as protein and carbohydrate can be extracted to prepare coconut honey. Undesirable flavor changes in desiccated coconut are due to oxidative rancidity of the oil 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Production Process Raw Material Procurement: Procurement is the connection process of purchasing and arranging in bound movement of all items, supplies, materials, parts, finished inventory and general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses.  Production Process

Steps involved in the manufacturing of Coconut honey Manufacturing unit  Collection of Coconut Sap: The coconut sap is collected from the cutting portion of stem which ultimately eaten by bees too.  Boiling of Coconut Sap: Boiling of the coconut sap to evaporate the water under moderate heat condition (115 ºC) with occasional stirring until it got thick.  Heating mixture: Mixture can be done continually until the coconut sap is converted into granular form.  Air drawn to Mixture: The granular form of coconut sap is transferred from the large ovens to reduce moisture content.  Packaging of Honey: Coconut honey is proceeded for filtration and bottling, according to the market demand. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 3000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 to Rs. 40000 per month. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery This is a semi-automatic type of plant and the production capacity is set to be 80 Kg of Coconut Honey per day. Machines-  Coconut Honey dehydrator machine: The coconut honey dehydrator machine is used to remove moisture to the coconut sap by boiling this at 80 ºC.

INTRODUCTION Pressure cooking is the process of cooking food at high pressure, employing water or a water-based cooking liquid, in a sealed vessel known as a pressure cooker. High pressure limits boiling, and permits cooking temperatures well above 100 °C (212 °F) to be reached. Pressure cookers work by expelling air from the vessel, and trapping the steam produced from the boiling liquid inside. This raises the internal pressures and permits high cooking temperatures. This, together with high thermal heat transfer from the steam, cooks food far more quickly, often cooking in between half and a quarter the time for conventional boiling. After cooking the steam is released so that the vessel can be opened safely The pressure cookers are extensively used in household for preparing food. The pressure cookers have preference over the conventional cooking utensils due to the advantage of retaining the nutritive value and flavour of the cooked food and less time required for cooking and thus effecting considerable savings in time and fuel. It is a closed cooking vessel for use with external heat source, capable of maintaining working steam pressure of 1.0 Kg. Sq. cm. The full liquid capacity of vessel i.e. total internal volume with lid in position, ranges from 2 to 10 litres capacity. But in market, the, Pressure Cookers of 3 and 5 litre capacity are mostly demanded by the customers. It is a well known fact that a pressure cooker cooks food at a pressure higher than that of ambient pressure, thus necessitating sufficient precaution required in designing, manufacturing and use of domestic pressure cooker to safeguard against accidents in the kitchen. MANUFACTURING PROCESS The pressure cooker consists of components like main body, lid, regulator, gasket, fusible plug, handles, lugs etc. The main body and lid of the pressure cooker are manufactured of aluminum alloy sheet/Circles of different thicknesses depending upon the size and specifications of the Cooker. The components i.e. pressure regulator, Bakelite Handles and Lugs, Rubber Gasket, Fusible Plugs, Screws, Rivets, Packing Boxes etc. are usually purchased from outside sources by the pressure cooker manufacturers. In the manufacturing of pressure cookers operations like circle cutting, deep drawing of body, drawing of lid, trimming of body and lid, notching of body, drilling of holes in body and lid, fixing of lugs, handles, vent pipe, buffing and polishing, testing, packing etc. are involved.

MARKETING ASPECTS It has been observed, keeping in view the average family, that medium size/capacity pressure cookers have greater market. With the rapid advancement in the general living standards of the people, the demand of pressure cookers is increasing day by day. Accordingly, there is great scope for setting up of the new units for manufacture of pressure cookers to standard specifications. Indian Government’s Ujjawala Scheme has opened a wide market for pressure cooker manufacturer as the demand is growing rapidly in rural and semi urban areas after successful implementation of Ujjawala Yojna. Now the families of Rural areas are also requires pressure cooker by replacing the traditional cooking utensils on LPG stoves provided to them under the scheme.

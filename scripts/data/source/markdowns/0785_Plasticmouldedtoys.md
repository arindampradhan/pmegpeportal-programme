PLASTIC MOULDED TOYS Introduction: A plastic toy is an item that is used to play, especially one designed for such use. Playing with toys can be an enjoyable means of training children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Most of the Indian Toy industry operates through an extensive distribution network in the domestic markets. Big retailers / Large Format Stores such as Big Bazaar, Wall-Mart, etc. However, they also operate on the existing Volume based business model, making price the most sensitive aspect. Designing of toys: Plastic Toy factories need the work of designers. Clients and toy company employees have a brainstorming session and, after that, designers need to prepare sketches of the toy in question. They include the size, colors, and facial expressions and poses, according to the type of toy (it

can be a figurine, a doll, a car or some plastic article. After the wax model is finished, engineers will determine whether the toy should be manufactured in just one piece or in many of them. To manufacture certain toys, some plastic pieces require other processes, such as tampography, also called pad-printing. This technique transfers a 2-D image into a 3-D object and it allows details like an expressive face to be applied to the plastic piece, think of the Lego, Mega Bloks, Miniland or Playmobile plastic toys with their eyes and smiles. Advantages of Plastic moulded toys: Plastic toys are far more durable than wooden toys and can be bent, twisted and quite often stamped on before any serious damage happens to them. Of course, it’s always best to instill a certain amount of respect for toys in your children, but at least plastic toys can stand up to a bit of rough play. Another bonus of plastic toys over some materials, such as wood, are that plastic toys are washable toys. If the little darlings come in from the garden covered in mud or other delights, you can simply wipe their toys clean while you dunk them in the bath to clean up. There’s no need, as with fabric toys, to even put them through a wash in the machine, all it takes is a damp cloth and the toys are as good as new. Plastic Moulded Toys Market analysis: The existence of toys in India dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization around five thousand years ago. Driven by a huge consumer base, India represents an important market for plastic toys as well. There are a large variety of toys currently available in the market. The diverse product category ranges from traditional plush toys, construction and building toys, dolls, board games and puzzles to high-end electronic toys, educational toys, ride-ons, etc. There are toys which are domestically produced by small, medium and large manufactures and also those that are produced from renowned international brands. Each toy category has inexpensive and high-end versions.

Blow moulding machine 1 1200000 2. Ultrasonic welding machine 1 300000 3. Printing machine 1 250000 4. Tools & dies 50000 Raw material: Basic raw material requirements are: 1. HDPE Granules(60-40 Rs/kg) 2. Colours & pigments(100-140 Rs/kg) 3. Packing material Manufacturing Process:  First of all, HDPE granules put into the hopper of blow moulding machine, after that raw material through screw barrier shifts towards heater and convert into plastic paste.  After that we can add colour into the paste as per the requirement (with the help of master patch, it is used to give colour to plastic paste).  Next In the blow moulding process, the raw plastic material is shaped into a hollow tube with one open end called a parison. The parison is pressed into a cooled metal mould and compressed air is forced into the

parison. When the formed plastic cools down and hardens the metal mould opens and expels the product.  After finishing of plastic toys they are sent to printing section to create different prints and design on toys & then with the ultrasonic welding machine toys are joined together and assembled.  Packaging of toys and left over material is sent to crushing section for re processing. Product Types: This project report is prepared on toys ranging from Rs.5- 50 Per toys. And 1 litre Double station Blow Moulding machine. S No. Particulars Selling Price Raw material cost 1. 5 Rs.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1000Sqft. Civil work will cost around 2 Lac (approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40 hp.

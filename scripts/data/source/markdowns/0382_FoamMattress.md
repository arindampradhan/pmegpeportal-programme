FOAM MATTRESS Introduction: A mattress is a large pad for supporting the reclining body, used as or on a bed. Mattresses may consist of a quilted or similarly fastened case, usually of heavy cloth, that contains hair, straw, cotton, foam rubber, etc.; a framework of metal springs; or they may be inflatable. Mattresses are usually placed on top of a bed base which may be solid, as in the case of a platform bed, or elastic, e.g. with an upholstered wood and wire box spring or a slatted foundation. Foam mattresses rely on air trapped within aerated substances (rather than springs) to offer support and bounce. Foam mattresses generally consist of three broad types: polyurethane foam, memory foam, and foam latex. Benefits & Market Potential: Various benefits are  Reduce pressure points  Reduce dust mites

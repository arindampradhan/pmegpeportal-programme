33-3 I. SUMMARY This profile envisages the establishment of a plant for the production of 10,000 tonnes of lime per annum. The present demand for the proposed product is estimated to be 28,000 tonnes per annum and it is projected to reach 79,504 tonnes by the year 2010. The plant will create employment opportunity for 34 persons. The total investment requirement is estimated at about Birr 17.47 million, out of which Birr 13.26 million is for plant and machinery. The project is financially viable with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 16% and net present value ( NPV) of Birr 4.72 million, discounted at 10.5%. II. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION Lime is inorganic chemical compound which is usually known as quick lime or unslaked lime obtained from a naturally occurring compound called limestone. Quick lime which is chemically expressed as calcium oxide, a strong caustic ingredient widely used in construction industry in the preparation of mortar and plasters. It is also used for white washing of houses and building. Iron and steel plants and foundries use lime as fluxing agent in considerable quantities. Some drugs and pharmaceuticals, paper mills, pesticides formulation plants, and other chemical processing industries use it as additives. Moreover, it has a considerable contribution in agriculture as an agent for removal of excess soil acidity.

33-4 III. MARKET STUDY AND PLANT CAPACITY A. MARKET STUDY 1. Present Supply & Demand a) Supply of Lime The current source of supply of lime to the domestic market are Dire Dawa Cement and Lime Factory, Ethio Llime Factory of Senkele, the Caustic Soda lime unit and the Wonji Shoa Sugar Estates supplemented with small quantity of imports. The Caustic Soda and the Showa Sugar Estates lime factories mainly produce for their own use, while the remaining two are primarily producing for the market. Dire Dawa Cement and Lime Factory mainly concentrates on production of cement and allocates only part of its capacity for production of lime. In addition to the above, the Ethiopian Educational Materials Production and Distribution Enterprise (EMPEDA) using its chalk production unit, produces small quantity of masonry lime for the market. As the major function of this unit is chalk production, only small proportion is allocated to masonry lime production. There are small producer of lime in a traditional method scattered all over the country and such producers are also available around Negele. The contribution of traditional suppliers to the local market is quite small and the major source of supply are those factories which use the modern firing system. Available statistics however, does not capture the total domestic supply of lime. Table 3.1 shows information from official document.

33-6 b) Demand The present users of lime are the building construction sector, tanneries, sugar industries, chemical industries, textile mills, water & sewerage treatment plants, etc. In addition to industrial applications, lime has also important application in agricultural sector. It is used as a neutralizing agent in irrigated agriculture where soils are affected by acidity. The gold mine industries also apply lime in certain process. In general lime has wider application and hence has a growing demand in the industrial, agricultural, construction and mining sectors. Lime has the following important uses in each sector:- - Use of lime in building construction Lime is used as a binder for bedding bricks and blocks in wall construction until it was partly replaced by portland cement. Its cohesiveness, plasticity, strength, etc. render it suitable as a mortar material for plastering and block and masonry works. - Use of lime in water and sewerage treatment Potable water should be colourless, free from suspended impurities and should not contain dissolved impurities hazardous to health. This is partially achieved by the treatment of the raw water with lime. Lime treatment reduces the acidity in water and clears the water by settling out cloudy suspensions. - Use of lime in Chemical Industries The biggest chemical use of lime is in the production of caustic soda and other alkalis. Much lime is also used to prepare precipitated calcium carbonate which is used as filler material for papers, paints, rubber and pharmaceutical. Acetylene gas and calcium cyananide fertilizers are made from calcium carbide, which itself is made from lime and coke.

33-7 - Use of lime in sugar industries The addition of lime milk to crude sugar extract allows the insoluble compounds to precipitate and to leave behind the socehasate solutions. The solution is then treated with carbondioxide, which precipitates the lime as carbonate, to obtain the precipitate sugar solution. Finally, the solution is evaporated to crystallize the sugar. Lime requirement for cane sugar refining may reach up to about 15 kgs per tonnes of sugar produced. - Agricultural uses of Limes Calcium has a dual function in soil. It is an essential nutrient and is also the dominant base and keeps soils neutral in reaction. If calcium ions which are normally lost by bleaching are not replaced regularly, positively charged hydrogen ion take their place, raising the acidity level of the soil i.e. its p H falling below the neutral point of p H7. It alters the structure of soil and leaves in a suitably friable state to be compacted in just a few hours after it is applied. With time the lime can form pozzolanic cement compounds which considerably raise the load bearing capacity of the soils and prevent it from falling apart. - Lime use in Metallurgical Industries Enormous quantities of high quality lime are required in steel making plant to form the flux which carries away the impurities as a slug. Lime is used with caustic soda in melting aluminum. Substantial amount of lime are used in the preparation of nonferrous metals by the floatation of their ores. The lime acting as a settling agent control the acidity during the process. Lime is also used in the textile industries.

33-8 2. Demand Projection Lime has various application in construction, mining, industry and agriculture. The agricultural sector is not currently using lime but it is a potential market for the product. Other sectors consume lime to a varying degree. Due to limited size of supply and old age of the existing suppliers (Senkle and Dire Dawa Cement and Lime Facotry ) the adequacy and stability of current supply is questionable. Due to lack of dependable supplies, new projects are being forced to install their own lime producing unit as in the case of Caustic Soda Factory which makes project costs quite expensive. If users operate at their full capacity, the Fincha Sugar Estate and Caustic Soda Factory have a combined demand of 16,000 tonnes/per year. The construction secor, the water treatment plant, the tanneries the gold mine and other users of lime have a combined demand of 12,000 tonnes at current level of production. This brings the current effective demand to 28,000 tonnes. It is assumed that other than the existing national market, new demands will be generated in the Somali Region if some of the envisaged projects like tanneries, road construction and urban housing construction are implemented by the public and private sectors. Based on the above assumption, the average growth rate (11%) of historical data shown in Table 3.1 has been applied to the current effective demand to project future demand of lime.

The demand gap will grow from the current level of 18,000 tonnes to 69,504 tonnes by year 2010. 3. Pricing and Distribution Currently, the retail price of lime in Jigiga is Birr 120/quintal. Allowing 30% profit mark up for retailers an ex-factory selling price of Birr 84/quintal is proposed for the envisaged project. The product can be distributed directly from the plant to major users or it can be sold by making use of agents in case of masonry lime.

33-10 B. PLANT CAPACITY AND PRODUCTION PROGRAMME 1. Plant Capacity In determining the plant capacity of the lime production plant the future demands of the product and the economic of scale of the available technologies were taken into consideration. According to the data obtained from the market study, the demand gap for lime raises from 18,000 tonnes to 69,504 tonnes from years 2001 to 2010, respectively. Hence, based on the demand gap and the minimum economic of scale for lime production, a plant with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum is selected. 2. Production Programme It is assumed that the lime plant will start at 70% in the first year, and then raise its production by 85% in the second year and finally operates at 100% capacity in the third year. IV. MATERIALS AND INPUTS A. MATERIALS The principal raw material for the production of lime is lime stone. This raw material is a sedimentary rock dominantly composed of carbonate minerals, particularlly carbonates of calcium and magnesium. The commonly known chemical composition of limestone is calcium oxide, (Ca O), and carbon dioxide, (CO ). However, small amounts of impurities such as silica and 2 aluminum may be present in lime stone mineral. Thus, the major raw material for the production of lime at the Somali Region is lime stone, which is one of the largest mineral reserve in the region. Wachile area, which is south of Neghele has an enormous reserve of best quality lime stone known as Jurassic. The annual requirement of this raw material is shown in Table 4.1

33-12 the envisaged plant a horizontal rotary kiln is found to be appropriate for the calcination process. A quarried or mined lime stone raw material is first crushed and screened to produce the required size before it is fed to the kiln. In the horizontal rotary kiln a decomposition reaction takes place at a high temperature ranging (900-1100) degree centigrade. The burnt lime stone results into calcium oxide (C O) and carbondioxide (CO ). The lime thus a 2 formed is cooled in drum cooler to about 800c. and then packed for storage or delivery. 2.

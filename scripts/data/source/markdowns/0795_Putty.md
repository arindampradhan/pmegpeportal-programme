 It gives very good protection from severe climatic conditions like rain, heat, water, humidity, salt atmosphere near sea-shores, to all types of cemented walls, surfaces.  It prevents growth of fungus and bacteria on masonry surfaces.  It gives very good colour and pleasing appearance to all types of masonry surfaces.  Cements paint hides out various surface irregularities, hair lining, roughness etc. thereby giving smooth and pleasing appearance to all cemented masonry surfaces where it is applied. Cement paints normally give smooth and matt finish.

blue, Phthalocyanine Green, Red Oxide etc. with suitable quantity of extenders like whiting, china clay etc. The binder is the white cement or ordinary Portland cement-33 grade which acts as a film former or pigment binder. Here water is used as solvent which is generally, added before application of cement paint to the masonry surface. Water is to be added in cement paint to bring it to the desired consistency. Additives like wetting and dispersing agents, anti fungicidal agents etc. are added in small percentage to impart specific properties to the cementpaint. In the manufacturing of Cement Paints Ball Mills and Edge Runner are used. All the pigments/extenders and some portion of binder (e.g. White cement, Ordinary Portland cement-33 grade etc.) with dispersing agents as per formulation are charged in the Ball Mills and run till the desired grinding/dispersion is achieved. The ground material is taken out with the help of the rest portion of binder to the Edge Runner machine. Again it is grinded and mixed uniformly. Anti-fungicides and other required additives as per formulation are added here. Then shade matching is done in comparison with the colour card of manufacturer or as per the requirements of customers. Then quality control testing is done to achieve the required properties. After quality control testing is O. K. It is packed into bags. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1400Sqft. Civil work will cost around 5 Lac (approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 hp.

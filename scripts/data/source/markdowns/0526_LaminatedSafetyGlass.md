LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS Introduction: Laminated safety glass is a sandwich made up of a PVC interlayer or inter layers adhered between two glass sheets. Laminated glass is more resistant to fracture than monolithic glass, but in case of fracture, the PVC interlayer holds the fragments in place. Laminated safety glass has good industrial potential due to its multiple advantages in commercial and industrial applications though the product is not as popular as toughened glass. The main applications of laminated safety glass are:  Automobile  Railways  Marine Vessels  Aircraft  Household Construction appliances & other Industrial applications

Advantages & Market Potential: The main advantages of Laminated safety glass are:  On accidents the glass does not harm/ injure the body.  It acts as a good insulator  It is sound proof  It has got a good strength compared to toughened and other sheet glasses. There is a very good demand for setting up this product in small scale sector, in commercial and industrial applications. The main consumer of these products are Railways, Automobiles, Defence, Aircrafts, Marine vessels and in domestic applications. The growth of laminated safety glass industry depends upon the development of automobile industry and also in construction of multi-storeyed buildings. As the automobile industry is steadily growing, the demand for laminated safety glass is also increasing. Besides this, there is considerable demand for laminated safety glass as spares for replacement purposes. Therefore, there is good scope for setting up new units. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. 3mm thickness sheet float glass 2. PVC Sheet 3. Lamination Chemicals 4. Packing material Machinery Requirements: Major machines and equipments are as follows: S No. Name Quantity Amount 1. Glass washing and drying machine with 1 60000 Blower 2. Hand operated glass lamination machine 1 190000

Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 550000 Manufacturing Process: The raw materials for manufacturing the laminated safety glass are ordinary sheet glass/float glass and PVC sheet. Sheet glass/float glass suitable for this product should be of good quality i.e. free from stone, weariness, stresses, strains, scratches and other surface defects. The important stages in the manufacture of laminated sheet glass are:  Raw glass sheet inspection  Glass Cutting  Glass Washing  PVC Interlayer Cutting  Preparing the resin  Assembly of sheet glass and interlayer  Pouring resin on each side of the PVC between it and the glass  Rolling & pressing  Drying  Edge Finishing  Final Inspection & Packing Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area

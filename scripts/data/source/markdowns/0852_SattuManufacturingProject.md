SATTU UDYOG INTRODUCTION Sattu is made by processing gram. Gram is a commonly used pulse and dal or curry is made out of it which is very popular item in majority of the Indian households. De-husked grams are cleaned, roasted and pulverized to convert them in powder or flour form and this is known as Sattu. It is used in many vegetarian food and snack preparations. Bhojpur or Hazaribagh districts could be an ideal location as there are many dal mills in the region. Reportedly, there are very few sattu making plants This is very popular item of Bihar and Obviously Bihar or Jharkhand are the preferred locations. Sattu is regularly used in many households and restaurants & eateries. It is used in many food and snack preparations especially during summer and is an item of mass consumption.

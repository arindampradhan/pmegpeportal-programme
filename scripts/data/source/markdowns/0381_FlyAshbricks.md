FLY ASH BRICKS INTRODUCTION Fly ash is a fine, glass‐like powder recovered from gases created by coal‐fired electric power generation. Fly ash material is solidified while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify while suspended in the exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 µm to 100 µm. They consist mostly of silicon dioxide (Si O2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and iron oxide (Fe2O3). Why use fly ash in concrete? How much fly ash in concrete? Typically, concrete designers use fly ash a partial replacement for Portland cement at values up to 30 percent of the total cementitious composition. The use of high percentages (high volumes) of fly ash has been studied extensively over the last 15 years, and the benefits of this type of concrete have been well documented. When properly designed and constructed, the increased benefits of concrete made with 40, 50, and 60 percent fly ash replacement include dramatically reduced concrete permeability, and excellent resistance to all forms of premature deteri

Advantages Key advantages of using fly ash  Improved workability  Reduced permeability  Reduced heat of hydration  High sulphate resistance  Increased long term strength  High chloride corrosion resistance  Grater resistance to alkali reactivity  Better concrete finish Reduced shrinkage  Improved workability Environmental effects Utilization of fly ash is environment friendly with improved cementitious binder economics.  Fly ash utilization reduces the requirement of clay, sand, lime stone in cement manufacturing and hence conserves natural resources.  Fly ash utilization reduces the cement requirement and hence carbon‐dioxide liberation during cement manufacturing is reduced.  Fly ash utilization reduces the top soil requirement for land filling / brick manufacturing and saves agricultural land.  Fly ash utilization achieves increased strength of the finished concrete product without increasing the cement content FLYASH LIME BRICKS SPECIFICATION Fly ash is a useful by‐product from thermal power stations using pulverized coal as a fuel and has considerable pozzolanic activity. This national resource can be gainfully utilized for manufacture of fly ash‐lime bricks as a supplement to common burnt clay building bricks leading to conservation of natural resources and improvement in environmental quality. Fly ash‐lime bricks are obtained from materials consisting of fly ash in major quantity, lime and an accelerator acting as a catalyst.

Fly ash‐lime bricks are generally manufactured by inter‐grinding or blending various raw materials which are then molded into bricks and subjected to curing cycles at different temperatures and pressures. On occasions, as and when required, crushed bottom ash or sand is also used in the composition of the raw material. Crushed bottom ash or sand is used in the composition as a coarser material to control water absorption in the final product. Fly ash reacts with lime in presence of moisture to form a calcium silicate hydrate which is the binder material. Thus fly ash‐lime brick is a chemically bonded brick. These bricks are suitable for use in masonry construction just like common burnt clay bricks. Production of fly ash‐lime building bricks has already started in the country and it is expected that this standard would encourage its production and use on mass scale. This standard lays down the essential requirements of fly ash‐lime bricks so as to achieve uniformity in the manufacture of such bricks. USES AND APPLICATIONS Fly ash bricks are used in building industry. Fly ash Sand‐Lime bricks: Building industry: Fly ash sand‐lime bricks can be used as an alternative material for burnt clay bricks which is one of the important building materials used for construction of housing and buildings. The fly ash building bricks are unable in all types of brick masonry works and can substitute the conventional burnt clay bricks in nearly all applications.

Advantages of Fly ash sand‐Lime bricks: 1. Uniform size, require less quantity cement mortar. 2. Can be used as facing bricks without any external plastering. 3. Lower bulk density. 4. More resistant to salinity and water seepage. 5. Utilization of waste and conservation of soils. 6. Saving in fuel. Characteristics of Fly ash‐Sand‐Lime bricks: 1. Bricks are of uniform size and shape. 2. They have high wet compressive strength 3. They have low drying shrinkage 4. They are free from efflorescence 5. The quality of fly ash sand lime brick is found to be superior to conventional burnt clay bricks in some respects such as water absorption, crushing strength, etc. 6. The bricks are also lighter as compared to burnt clay bricks. Advantages of Fly ash‐Sand Lime Bricks over Clay‐Bricks: 1. Lower requirement of water in construction 2. Elimination of plastering from outside wall 3. More resistance to salinity and water

RAW MATERIAL Fly Ash Fly ash forms the major component of the raw min for Fly ash bricks. Therefore it controls to a large extent the properties of the finished product. As the ash is non‐plastic, a binder must be added either plastic clay or Portland cement. Fly ash content ranges from 60 to 80%. Fly ash is a fine residue obtained from thermal power stations using ground or powered coal as boiler fuel. It can be utilized in various forms as building material. The thermal power stations in the country throw large quantities of fly ash which goes as waste but which could be effectively used as partial replacement of cement. Lime It is generally desirable to use a high calcium lime of reasonable purity as it is the most important constituent which reacts with silica and alumina etc. present in the fly ash to form the binder under hydrothermal conditions other burnt lime is not desirable as it does stake readily. The particles of lime should be fine enough to be thoroughly distributed and coat the grains of the mix Gypsum: This too is an industrial waste. This is available at Fertilizer Plant as in industrial wastes. Sand / Crusher Dust. Sand is used as an economizer and to increase the strength of bricks to some extent. Sand is procured locally. Crusher dust can also be successfully used in place of sand.

PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE The Process of manufacture is simple and suitable to start. A mix of Fly Ash, Cement, Gypsum and Sand/Crusher Dust are automatically weigh batched in a batching plant. 1. Loading of Raw materials‐ Mini Loader Loads materials into Batching plant 2. Automatic Batching – The Raw materials are automatically weighed as per the preset weights by means of Load cells and its control circuit. Cement, if it is available in Bulk, then silo and screw controller is used to auto weight. Otherwise, the batching is programmed as per 1 bag of cement. 3. Mixing ‐ From the batching plant the mixture hopper pulls the materials and then the mix is blended homogenously and intimately in a semi wet form in a Twin shaft mixture. The Water is automatically added as per time set. The TWIN SHAFT mixture ensures that a perfect mix is done in shortest possible time. 4. Carrying to Brick machine ‐ The mix is carried to the casting machine by means of conveyer belt. 5. Automatic Brick Making‐ there is a series of operations which is achieved by automatic PLC system. Pallet is pulled into the Machine. The mix is then collected fed into the machine moulds. There is a T boggy which uniformly spreads the materials in the moulds. Automatic PLC controlled Vibration and hydraulic pressure is given for a while and bricks are cast on the pallets. The dual application of Pressure and vibration ( in a patent pending micro‐ sequence application ) ensures perfect compaction with best quality of bricks 6. Automatic Stacking ‐ The pallets along with the freshly cast bricks are rolled on a roller platform to the pallet stacker. The Pallet stacker stacks the pallets along with the bricks automatically and the 7. Fork lift shifting– The Final stack of 5 to 10 pallets and bricks are lifted with a Fork Lifter and carried to the drying bay/room for 24 Hours for initial setting. 8. Curing ‐ Soon after the initial setting, the Blocks/ Bricks are stacked for curing in layers. The layers are stacked in a way to enable water and air to go all around, to ensure proper curing and drying. The curing process is continued for 7 days. The blocks are allowed to normally dry for a day. Now they are ready for dispatch. Alternatively, the blocks/bricks can be steam cured for 8 hours or mist cured for 24 hours immediately after production, and made ready for dispatch immediately. 9. Dispatch ‐ the cured bricks can be dispatched to market.

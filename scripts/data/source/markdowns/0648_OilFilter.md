OIL FILTER‐ TWO WHEELER Introduction: Oil filter - as the name implies - is a filter designed to remove contaminants from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. The oil filter helps remove contaminants from engine’s oil that can accumulate over time as the oil keeps your engine clean. Most oil filters look very similar, but small differences in the threads or gasket size can determine whether or not a particular filter will work on your vehicle. Filters containing an adsorbent or catalyst such as charcoal (carbon) may also remove odors and gaseous pollutants such as volatile organic compounds or ozone. Uses & Market Potential: Oil filters are used in many different types of machinery. Of our interest in particular is the use of the oil filter in internal- combustion engines in motor vehicles. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an Oil Filter of some type as well. The demand of Oil Filters is closely linked with production of two wheelers in the country. These are required mainly as original equipment but these components have also replacement demand as a spare part. India automotive filter market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% during 2017 to 2023. Growth in the market is expected to be fueled by growing automobile

sales, expanding vehicle fleet size and increasing purchasing power of consumers in the country. Raw Material: Basic raw materials are as follows: 1. Mild Steel Sheets of different sizes 2. Synthetic Filter Fabric 3. Glue 4. Packing material Raw Material Requirement: S No. Raw Material Quantity Rate Value 1. Mild steel sheet 14000 kg 42 588000 2. Synthetic Filter Fabric 57000 kg 150 8550000 3. Glue 1500 kg 120 180000 4. Packing material 150000 Manufacturing Process: The primary raw material is mild steel sheet which is formed into different metal component and synthetic filter fabric. The all raw materials are procured as per production plan and stored in raw material warehouse. The sheet metal rolls of different sizes are taken from raw material inventory to their respective machine shop section so as to manufacture the required oil filter component out of them. A sheet metal roll is fed to unwinding station located at start of each metal component manufacturing unit. There are 2 metal component manufacturing units; Core and Capping Disc The first metal part is the core, for which the unwinding station unwinds the sheet metal roll and feeds it to a punching press with perforating tool and die. After the sheet metal is perforated a shearing station shears of the sheet metal at required

length followed by which at rolling station rolls the perforated piece of sheet metal into a cylinder which is then welded to make the form self-supporting. The second metal part are the capping discs. The unwinding station unwinds the sheet metal and feeds it to a Blanking press, which blanks out a disc from metal sheet, followed by which a power press with progressive punching and forming tool and die forms the required shape in capping disc. The last part of oil filter is filter element which in this case is made out of synthetic filter fabric, the filter fabric is folded manually and a steel clip is clipped at end of filter element to make it into a closed loop. All the components manufactured are taken to oil filter assembly section where, glue spreading machine spreads glue over capping disc followed by which core is placed, then the filter element followed by another capping disc. The assembled filter is then fed into hot plate press to cure the glue and obtain the finished filter. The oil filter are then cleaned and are now ready, they are inspected for quality, packaged and sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 - 1400Sqft. Civil work will cost around Rs. 6 Lac(Approx.) Machinery: Basic machineries requirement are as follows: 1. Blanking Press 2. Punching Press with Perforation Tool 3. Power Press with Progressive Punching and Forming Die 4. Sheet Metal Rolling and Welding Machine 5. Hot Plate Press

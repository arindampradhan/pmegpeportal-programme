ULTRAMARINE BLUE Introduction: Ultramarine blue is a deep blue color pigment which was originally made by grinding lapis lazuli into a powder. The name comes from the Latin ultramarines, which literally means "beyond the sea". Ultramarine blue has small, uniformly sized particles of a single color, but (being a ground- up natural stone) lapis pigment is a mix of colors and irregularly shaped particles, which have a different texture and reflect light differently. Ultramarine blue is not considered toxic, but care should be used in handling the pigment. Uses & Market Potential: Ultramarine Blue is extremely safe, environmentally friendly and nonhazardous blue pigment with various applications worldwide. It’s obtained by a synthetic manufacturing process and thus possibility for close control over its physical, chemical and colour characteristics, enables the production of distinct types of blue pigment, which are readily accepted by plastic, printing ink, paint, cement, soaps, and detergents, paper and many other industries due to the added advantages it

Manufacturing Process: Ultramarine poor in silica" is obtained by fusing a mixture of soft clay, sodium sulphate, charcoal, sodium carbonate and sulphur obtained from a slurry mixer. The product is at first white i.e. after mixing, but soon turns green "green ultramarine" when it is pre-heated using air or sulphur dioxide at 350 to 450 °C to oxidise sulphides into the intermediate product to S2 and Sn chromophore molecules which are responsible for said colour. Then the mixture is heated in a kiln at 700 to 750 °C, sometimes in brick-sized amounts, as the slurry burns, a fine blue pigment is obtained. The resultant solids are then cooled utilizing clinker cooler and ground using fine grinding mill, the whole process produces large amounts of sulphur dioxide which needs to be managed. The produced ultramarine blue is stored in silo from where it’s filled in sacks, which are then sealed using sack stitching machine, followed by which they are sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 50 Hp. Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

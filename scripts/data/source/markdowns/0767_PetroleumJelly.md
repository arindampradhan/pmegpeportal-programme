PROJECT REPORT ON PETROLEUM JELLY INTRODUCTION: Petroleum Jelly is also known as Mineral Jelly or Petrolatum. It is mostly used in emulsion form in cosmetics & pharmaceutical for the preparations of various creams, ointments, lotions etc. Commercial Petroleum Jelly is used in the manufacturing of lubricants & Grease. Petroleum Jelly of good quality is used in Vaseline manufacturing. It is also used as a moisturizer in good quality toilet soaps. It also finds its use as a anti rusting agent for iron goods like blade, wire surgical instruments etc. It is available in the market in various forms. It may be white, yellow, green or may be of some colour depending upon ingredients used. This project is prepared for white petroleum jelly, which can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Hence strict quality control is required for the manufacturing of this item.

MARKET POTENTIAL: Various Cosmetics and pharmaceuticals are used by the large number of people in general for wounds, cuts, burns, skin diseases. In today’s business word, more and cosmetics industries are coming up and thereby increasing the demand for the raw materials like petroleum jelly. Hence it can be assumed that the petroleum jelly is having very good market potential in view of development of cosmetic & pharmaceutical industry in India. BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: The production is based on single shift of eight hours and 300 working days per annum. The cost in respect of Plant & Machinery has been taken at the time of preparation of Project Profile, which may vary from place to place and time to time. It is presumed that plant will work at 60% efficiency in the first year, 70% in the second year and 80% in the third year. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: It will take about eight months to start commercial production as under : Sr. No. Activity Estimated Period 01. Registration under MSME Act 0 – 1 Month 02. Preparation of Scheme 0 –1 Month 03. Sanction of Loan 1 – 5 Month 04. Placement of Order for Plant & Machinery 5 – 6 Month 05 Power & Water Connection 5 – 6 Month 06.

PRODUCT AND ITS APPLICATION Petroleum Jelly is also known as Mineral Jelly or Petrolatum. It is mostly used in emulsion form in cosmetics & pharmaceutical for the preparations of various creams, ointments, lotions etc. Commercial Petroleum Jelly is used in the manufacturing of lubricants & Grease. Petroleum Jelly of good quality is used in Vaseline manufacturing. It is also used as a moisturizer in good quality toilet soaps. It also finds its use as an anti-rusting agent for iron goods like blade, wire surgical instruments etc. It is available in the market in various forms. It may be white, yellow, and green or may be of some color depending upon ingredients used. This project is prepared for white petroleum jelly, which can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Hence strict quality control is required for the manufacturing of this item. After petroleum jelly became a medicine chest staple, consumers began to use it for many ailments as well as cosmetic purposes, including toenail fungus, genital rashes (non-STD), nosebleeds, diaper rash, and chest colds. Its folkloric medicinal value as a "cure-all" has since been limited by better scientific understanding of appropriate and inappropriate uses. It is recognized as an approved over-the-counter (OTC) skin protectant, and remains widely used in cosmetic skin care. The product mix varies depending upon quality and use of final product. The suggested product mix is as follows The product mix varies depending upon quality and use of final product. One of the formulae for petroleum jelly may be as under: Sr. No. Item Quantity (%) 01. Paraffin Wax Petroleum paraffin wax is by far the most 20 % widely used wax in the world. It is extracted

from crude oil during the petroleum refining process, and normally further hydro-treated for better stability. Petroleum paraffin wax can generally be categorized into Fully-refined and Semi-refined types. It is commonly used in the manufacturing of candles, fibre and particle boards, wax and carbon papers, rubber products, shoe polishes, etc. 02. Microcrystalline Microcrystalline wax is also derived from 20 % Wax crude oil. Compared to paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax generally contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbons, has higher viscosity and melting point, and is more elastic and sticky. It is used commonly in cosmetics, packaging, medicine, etc. 03. White Oil White oil is a mixture of refined liquid 60 % hydrocarbons. It can either be extracted from petroleum crude oil, or synthesized. It is transparent, colorless and practically tasteless and odorless. A wide range of white oils are available, differentiated by their levels of refining and viscosities. This oil is commonly used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food, agriculture, and polymer industries. MANUFACTURING METHOD: First of all, the ingredients are weighed as per the formulations. Now paraffin wax is taken in to reaction vessel with electrical heater (Jacketed). Now micro crystalline wax is added in to reaction vessel. Both the waxes are then melted with continuous mixing and the temperature

is maintained between 1200– 1300 C. Now liquid paraffin is added with continuous stirring (150-200 rpm) at constant temperature, so that ingredients are mixed together to form emulsion or jel. The whole mass is cooled down and sample is taken for testing. After testing, material is packed in suitable containers. The products would have to be manufactured as per standards laid down in IP, BP and such book of standards. Further it would be under the Food and Drugs Control Authority (FDCA). The Drugs and Pharmaceutical Industry in general is highly regulated in India. Regulatory authorities at the Central level and the State level monitor the same. At the Central level, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India is the apex organisation. At the state level the Food and Drugs Control Authority (FDCA) is the regulatory authority. Drugs & Cosmetics Act and Schedule M These authorities monitor and control the production of Drugs and Pharmaceutical products under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics (amendment) Act, 2005 & 2008 and guidelines (July 2015). The revised Schedule M under this Act is the main basis which specifies the detailed norms for location; building premises plant lay out, building, plant & machinery, manufacture, sterilization, packaging, quality control and such other key components. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) The Drugs and Pharmaceutical Industry in general is highly regulated in India. Regulatory authorities at the Central level and the State level monitor the same.

pharma units in general and such sterile products manufacturing units in particular would also have to comply with following  Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP),  Current Good Manufacturing Practices(c GMP) and  WHO-GMP Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. WHO-GMP certification is essentially for the plant set up, manufacturing facilities and related aspects. However Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products (Co PP) is also required for each of the products to exporting the same. This is given only after six months (stability period) of getting WHO-GMP Certificate. Current GMP (c GMP) is essentially an updating of the systems and facilities as per the requirement of regulated pharma market at the international level The above are in the form of guidelines and not part of any Act (except basic GMP). However they are essential to follow and implement to fulfill the requirement of the industry and the international market. Further highly systematic documentation and record keeping is a must as per the requirement of concerned authorities. It is to be noted that the Department of Health and Family Welfare proposes to introduce the Drug and Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill, 2015. This is in process. As and when this is passed and put into effect by way of an Act, all the Drugs and Pharmaceutical units (existing and new) would have to follow the norms under the amended act.

PROJECT REPORT BOUTIQUE (WOMEN DESIGNER WEAR) INTRODUCTION This pre‐feasibility study provides information on key facets of starting a Boutique business for Women Designer Wear. Growing number of boutiques have become an emblem of successful clothes business in India. Most people especially women prefer them over ordinary garment brands. There has been a mushroom growth in women designer wear boutiques since the last decade as they offer versatility and sophistication. This trend is not confined to metropolis alone but has also spread to small cities and towns. The rise is attributed to a growing middle class, exposure to media, entertainment, movies, internet and also to a fleet of qualified fashion designers graduating from fashion schools every year. Aspiring fashion graduates or potential entrepreneurs may find this growing sector a good prospect to capitalize on their potential, talent and market opportunity. In order to facilitate the potential investors, this document provides the basic information regarding business operations of apparel designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of women wear in India. 20

Production Process Flow The process of converting fabric into designer wear garments mainly follows the below mentioned sequence: Purchasing Design Pattern Making Raw Material Stitching Cutting Embroidery Presentation / Market / Finishing Display Clientele Installed & Operational Capacities The boutique business’s installed capacity will largely depend on the market size it will operate in and the potential clientele. On average, a designer can draw / design 300 designs per annum from which around 280 designs are selected on average The pre‐feasibility study is based on six (6) machines (single needle), two (2) over‐lock machines, one (1) embroidery machine, with an operational capacity of manufacturing 6000 dresses per annum. However, capacity utilization during first year of operation is assumed at 60%, Capacity utilization growth rate of 10% is considered for subsequently years. This production and sales capacity is estimated to be economically viable and justifies the capital as well as operational costs of the project. Breakup of the total number of dresses will be as follows: Total designs selected by Designer 280 No of size in each design 4 No of dresses in each size 4 Total readymade dresses 4,480 Made to measure dresses 1,520 Total Dresses 6,000 20

GEOGRAPHICAL POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENT The recommended location for setting up a boutique business will be a posh or semi‐ posh area of a metropolitan city across India that can offer easy access of customers to the outlet. It is further recommended that the proposed location should be taken on rent.

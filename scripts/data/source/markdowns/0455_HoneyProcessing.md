Honey is among the most popular and widely used sweetener with enormous health benefits. It is used by several cultures around the world serving as a base for many traditional medicines, especially in Ayurveda. It is used in strengthens immune system, preparing cosmetic products, health tonic and food processing industries for preparing different types of drinks, bakery products, sweets etc. Beekeeping is an ideal activity for development as a subsidiary occupation providing supplementary income. Beekeeping is feasible in areas where adequate bee flora available for a minimum period of 6 months. Honey produced by Indian hive bees is collected by modern extractor. The extracted honey contains hemophilic yeasts, which causes fermentation and destroy the quality of honey. To maintain the qualitative and quantitative value of honey the processing in modern Honey Processing plant is essential.

Product & it’s Application: From centuries, honey has been used as a natural sweetening agent and in the preparation of confectionaries. It has vast application in the pharmaceutical industry, and it is also considered as a medicine by Ayurved.

Honey is also used for making lozenges. However, it is mostly sold in glass Jars as pure honey. In bottled honey normally moisture content of honey is reduced. Good quality honey has high demand in the international market and it has the potential to generate substantial foreign exchange for the Country. Market Potential: Honey is a major consumable in the international market both as a food item as well as in industries such as Pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics and Confectionary. The demand is especially high for refined, high quality honey free pesticides, insecticides and other agrochemicals. In the domestic market very little amount of honey is use for personal consumption, while majority is utilized by the pharmaceutical and confectionary industry. With changing life style and increasing health consciousness, honey is been increasing consumes as health food. This is likely to drive the domestic demand in future. As per the information available from Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, India has exported 51547.31 MT of Natural Honey to the world for the worth of Rs. 653.58 crore/ 101.32 USD Million during the year of 2017-18 and the Major Export Destinations (2017-18) are USA, Saudi Arab, U Arab Emts, Canada and Qatar. Raw material: Only honey and basic packing material (bottle, lids and labels) are required for raw material.

In general, the following integrated steps are given below:  Initial Extraction  Dehumidification  Liquefaction and mixture  Heating  Pasteurization  Crystallization  Final Packaging Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant Operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

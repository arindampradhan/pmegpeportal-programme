1. INTRODUCTION Alcoholic beverages are a large group of beverages that contain varying amount of alcohol. Example of some of alcoholic beverages are Beer, wine, distilled spirits such as brandy, whiskey, rum, gin, cognac, vodka, tequila etc. They are produced from sugar containing liquid by alcoholic fermentation. Sugar, fermentable by yeast are present as such or are generated from raw materials by processing i.e. by hydrolytic cleavage of starch and dextrin, yielding simple sugar. the nutritional energy value of ethanol is high 7kcal/g or 29k J/g. Beer making or brewing uses germinated barley (malt), hops, yeast and water. In addition, of malt, other starch containing material is also added e.g., wheat, unmalted cereal called adjuncts (barley, wheat, corn and rice), starch flour, starch degradation products and fermentable sugar. Hops and aroma compound formed during fermentation are responsible for aroma, flavor and bitter taste of beer. Bottle filling of beer proceeds from fermentation tank to seminar fully automatic bottling process followed by pasteurization at 62 ᵒC for 20 minutes. Wine is the fermented produced from grapes. Wine involves longer fermentation process than beer and also long aging process resulting in alcohol content of 9% - 16% ABV. Sparkling wines can be made with second fermentation. A distilled beverage, spirit or liquor is an alcoholic beverage produced by distillation (concentration by distillation) ethanol is produced by mean of fermenting grain. Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic beverages that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. For the most common distilled beverages, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. Vodka, whiskey, gin, Brandy, Soju, baijiu, tequila are examples of distilled beverages.

TYPE ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION Beer 3 – 15% Wine 8 – 17% Fortified wine 15 -22% Spirits 15 – 98% Fruit juice <0.1% Cider 4 – 8% TYPICAL ABV RANGES FOR DIFFERENT ALCOHOL The concentration of alcohol in a beverage is usually stated as the percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV, the number of ml of pure ethanol in 100 ml of beverage) or as proof. Proof is twice the percentage of alcohol by volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (e.g., 80 proof = 40% ABV).

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 USES OF ALCOHOL BOTTLING PLANT The bottling plant is used for bottling of different alcoholic beverages and liquors such as i. Bottling of beer ii. Bottling of wine iii. Bottling of spirits such as Whiskey, Gin, Rum, Brandy etc. 2.2 RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT FOR ALCOHOL BOTTLING PLANT Various machinery such as bottle filling, capping, pasteurization unit and labelling unit are required in alcoholic beverage bottling plant. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS BOTTLE WASHING Bottles are rinsed with filtered water to remove impurities and cleared of labels. Sometimes carbon dioxide injected into bottles to reduce oxygen level. Empty Bottle Inspector (EBC) used to check the bottles for good washing otherwise rejects it. FILLING AND CAPPING washed bottles are then sent to filling machine which fills the bottles with Liquor. A few inert gases can be injected on the top to disperse the oxygen. Full Bottle

Inspector (FBI) check bottles for underfilling or overfilling. Capper applies bottle caps and sealed the bottles. PASTEURIZATION Filled bottles are then pasteurized at 1400F for 2-3 minutes. This helps to stops the growth of yeast that remains in the beer after packaging. LABELLING After pasteurization labels are applied. It should include the batch number, lot number, date & time of bottling, expiry dates etc. BOX PACKING Bottles are then packed into boxes and sent to the warehouse and ready for sale. COLD STORAGE To avoid all and any chemical or biochemical reaction, it is advisable to keep the products at temperatures below -18 ºC. The fluctuations of temperature in the storage chambers may impair the quality of the products, as well as to reduce their useful life.

BOTTLE WASHING FILLING AND CAPPING PASTEURIZATION LABELLING AND BOX PACKAGING COLD STORAGE FLOW CHART OF BOTTLING PROCESS FOR ALCOHOLIC DRINKS 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 LAND/ CIVIL WORK An area of almost 1500-2000 Sq. ft. would be suitable for bottling plant. This space would be required for raw materials storage mainly, production, packaging, storage of finished goods, and administrative work. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs. 20000-25000 per month.

3.2 PLANT AND MACHINERY 1. BOTTLE WASHING/CLEANING/ RINSING MACHINE The machine uses rotary glass bottle brushing machine for inside and outside brushing. The bottle is soaked in water before brushing. The bottle cleaning machine is suitable for water, juice, beer and wine bottles. The machine is suitable for different size bottle when with same bottle necks. 2. BOTTLE FILLING AND CAPPING MACHINE The machine incorporates filling and capping machine. It is widely used for Wine, beer, vodka, soya sauce, vinegar and so on. The machine adopts plain structure and vacuum air breathing principle makes filling easy and simple. It has precise filling level, no bottle break and leakage , easy operate and maintain. It consist of electromagnetic capping heads, with burden discharge function, make sure minimum bottle crash during capping.

3. PASTEURIZATION MACHINE This machine adopts the principle of pasteurization, biologically sterilizes the bottled alcohol. The qualified alcohol maintains a continuous and slow speed on the conveyor of Sterilizer. After the treatment of several temperature zones, certain spraying temperature and certain sterilizing time, Vegetative microorganisms are killed and the purpose is achieved for extending the time of preservation. FIG: pasteurization temperature – 62 – 82ᵒC ; Pasteurization Temperature – 30 seconds to 10 minutes; Power 3 k W; Pressure 0.4 – 0.5 Mpa; Price 5 – 10 lacs INR 4. LABELLING MACHINE The machine is used for alcohol bottle labelling machine. The machine consists of touch screen control panel that can control bottle conveying speed. The labelling device controlled by air cylinder.

5. COLD ROOM This is probably the simplest freezer used for freezing the liquors and alcohols, when working at lower scale. It is constituted by a freezing chamber in which the products are introduced. The insertion of the products may be accomplished by movable shelves provided with small wheels. The shelves may be loaded and unloaded manually. The product is placed on trays, and these ones are taken to the shelves. The air passes on the product already packed at the temperature range from -30ºC to -40ºC at a speed from 1.5 to 6.0 m/s, depending on the product. The high speed provides a good transference of heat. FIG: Temperature – (-50ᵒC) to 20ᵒC; Capacity 100 – 1000 ton; Power 7 k W; Price 5 – 12 lacs INR

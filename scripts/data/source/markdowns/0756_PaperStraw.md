PAPER STRAW Introduction: A paper drinking straw or drinking tube is a small pipe that allows its user to more conveniently consume a beverage. A thin tube of paper is used by placing one end in the mouth and the other in the beverage. Drinking straws can be straight or have an angle-adjustable bellows segment. Some companies have voluntarily banned or reduced the number of plastic straws distributed from their premises. Paper straw is gathering momentum due to ban imposed on the use of single use plastics. Manufacturing paper straws is a completely different process to producing plastic straws. Typically constructed of 3 plies of paper, the plies are bonded together with a small amount of water-based adhesive using a core-winding machine, or hot melt adhesives using a slot nozzle machine for very fast production lines. The choice of the paper and adhesive quality has a fundamental impact on the performance of the paper straw and the efficiency of manufacture. Uses & Market Potential: Paper drinking straw is expected to have the high market growth due to rising demand of the paper drinking straw as the packaging industry is witnessing shift towards non-plastic sustainable

Plastic drinking straw segment is expected to have the negative market growth over the forecasted period due to the banning of the plastic straws. Corporations, municipalities, and governments are imposing bans on the plastic straws. Raw Material: Major raw material are as follows: 1. Food Grade Paper 2. Food Grade Gum Powder 3. Packing material Machine Requirement: Major machinery and equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Paper straw making machine 1 900000 900000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Total Amount 950000 Manufacturing Process: The good quality of food grade paper rollis procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. The paper straw could be in one colour of more than one colour. As per requirement of colour, the paper rolls are mounted over the roller stand of the machine.

The paper is fed through rollers and sends into the gluing section. Food grade glue is mounted over the corners of the paper. After this, the paper gets reminded through a set of rollers as per required dimension. The inner diameter of the straw could vary from 4.7mm to 20 mm. The paper strips are stitched over one another precisely and glued together. After this, the straws are fed into the cutting section where the cutters are mounted. The straws are cut down as per the desired length and collected into the bins. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

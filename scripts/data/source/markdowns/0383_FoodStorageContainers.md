FOOD STORAGE CONTAINERS Introduction: A food storage container is used to hold food at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or in the freezer. Plastic containers are also available in many sizes, shapes, and styles. They are found in different degrees of sturdiness, from light weight disposable containers to heavy duty rigid plastic container. They are manufactured with clear, frosted, and colored plastic and most have airtight lids. They work great for storing food in the refrigerator and freezer, where the airtight lids prevent moisture loss. The airtight lids keep foods, such as cookies, crackers, chips, and cereals form becoming stale for a longer period of time when stored at room temperature. Plastic containers work well for all types of storage. They store well together and can really help organize a storage area. They are available in so many shapes and sizes that it is easy to find one to fit your special needs. Foods containing a lot of liquid, store easily in this type of container. Some brands have been designed to stack neatly to assist in storing them both when not in use and when using them to store food. They are lightweight and easy to handle. The plastic containers are sturdy enough to be easily stacked on each other when storing food in the refrigerator, freezer, and in the cupboard. Because of the plastic material, breakage is not as much of a concern as it is with glass containers. This project report includes the manufacturing of food container having average weight up to 200 grams using a single injection moulding machine. The project cost may vary with the production capacity and as per the shape and design of the output product.

Uses & Market Potential: Household Food Storage Containers helps in the safety and maintaining good quality of food. Ideal Household Food Storage Containers extends the shelf life of food, which depends on the food type, packaging and storage conditions particularly temperature and humidity. There are wide range of food packaging and containers now available made up from different materials. Refrigerator segment is one of the most innovative segment taken its root in the food storage container segment in which a wide variety of foodstuffs are contained and preserved through the use of low temperatures. Household food storage container segment has its well established market in the developed countries since ages. Food container market size is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 4.5% from 2016 to 2023. Since these products are required to be preserved for longer span of time, they are required to be packed using extremely durable, efficient and protective methods. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. PP or ABS Granules (Food grade) 2. Plasticizers 3. Packing material Machinery Requirement: Major machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Description Qty. Amount 1. Injection Moulding machine 1 1250000 2. Grinder 1 65000 3. Water Chiller 1 25000 4. Dies & other equipments Ls 300000 Total Amount 1640000 Manufacturing Process: In the first step, the raw material is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the profile dies are mounted precisely in the injection moulding machine as per product dimension. The die can have the arrangement of moulding a number of pieces in a single cycle as required. After this, barrel heaters of the

injection moulding machine of screw barrel are started and brought up to desired melting temperature of the PVC. In the next step, the pellets are added into the hopper of the injection moulding machine manually after weighing over scale. The pellets from the hopper are fed into the barrel section of the machine where the screw mounted in the machine rotates about horizontal axis. The pellets are fed into heating zone as the screw rotates. In the heating zone, plastic pellets melt to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the mold of the machine. From the extruded of the machine this molten plastic pellets are injected into the die at desired pressure and temperature. The molten plastic will acquire the shape of the die and cooling cycle of the machine begins. Water is used as a cooling medium which transfers heating through a suitable cooling arrangement. The molten plastic gets solidified and acquires the shape of the die. After this, when the cooling cycle completes, the mold gets opened and the ejector pin will ejects the toothpicks outside. After this, the common runner has been removed and toothpick gets separated out. After this, the uneven excess lines, burrs are removed. The non-uniform or deformed products are crushed using grinder into small pieces. After this, the toothpicks are packed and dispatched as per the requirement. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain

MOONJ BASKET & BAGS MAKING UNIT 2. Introduction: Uttar Pradesh has a custom of making baskets for everyday uses and for special occasions by coiling the outer layers of the grass called moonj. This craft is practiced mostly by women. Moonj and rara are kinds of wild grass which grow near the banks of the rivers around Allahabad. Moonj is external layer of the grass which is stripped and tied. This workmanship is been rehearsed from the last 60 to 70 years. The grass is cut throughout the colder time of year and the strip of the stalks is forgotten about in dew for quite a long time to help its tone. Numerous spilts are colored in brilliant tone and restricting is done these days with plastic strips, sparkle or material. The themes of basketry are made by adding hued grass in the middle. The Moonj coiled grass products

are ideal to serve daily life purposes. These natural products can be used as containers, food storage devices and wall decorators. The products are very simple, attractive and eco-friendly. Coiling is a basketry technique used by rural women in Allahabad, Amethi and Sultanpur districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh to make objects for use in the kitchen. The baskets are used in the kitchen for storing flour and food grains. The twining of the baskets these days is being done with material like colorful plastic strips, tinsel and cloth. They are so tightly coiled that they are almost waterproof and long-lasting. This craft is practiced mostly by women. The women gather raw materials from the factory and make products at their convenience after they finish daily chores. This craft has been passed down across the generations that have kept it alive. Also, the craft has traditional significance as the products are given as gifts to women in ritual functions and weddings. The art of basket weaving is as old as pottery. The ancient nomadic food gatherers wove reeds together to prepare baskets to hold their food or other collectibles. Later, with the advent of different cultures, basketry took shape both for daily use and ritual purposes. Special patterns have evolved according to local traditions and techniques. Though the process

involved in creating these products hasn’t changed over generations, but natural dyes are being used now to make them attractive. Originally, the colors were hardly used, but today if the item has to look impressive, bright colors which are natural dyes are generally preferred. While the most popular products include baskets, table mats and containers, new designs include earrings, fruit baskets and hand purses. 3. Market Potential: It's a one-piece create. When a particular kind of configuration is made, it can't be actually duplicated which gets troublesome if there should arise an occurrence of mass requests. Direct Create is committed to associating India's high quality conventions with the worldwide commercial center to make another plan worldview — one that drives advancement, spikes innovativeness and enables networks. . During Weddings times and celebrations season, these dealers additionally put ahead of time requests for Moonj-creates. Other than these dealers of city, there are a few brokers of Delhi, Varansi, and Lucknow who likewise infrequently buy Moonj-creates in the stock interest fasten for offering to definite customers with appropriate overall revenues. At first the Kaasa grass is dried and it is wrapped with the moonj grass by moving around Kaasa.

chairs, tables etc. The craftsmen make these products without using any advanced equipment. In this project we have discussed manufacturing of Moonj Bags & Moonj Baskets. 4.2. Raw Material- The Raw-materials needed in making Moonj-crafts are:  Moonj and Kaasa - The main raw material is procured in bulk once in year from Mehwa and surrounding areas. October is the best season to buy the raw material.  Kaccha Rang- The artificial raw color powder which is available in local markets is used to color the grass.  Edible salt is used to add with the dye solution. Average raw material cost of Moonj Bags per unit will be Rs. 800- 900 (Approx.) Average raw material cost of Moonj Baskets per unit will be Rs. 400- 500 (Approx.) 4.3. Manufacturing Process: The Moonj basketry-production measure is tedious and fundamentally done by the ladies at their available time. Strategy:  The traditional coiling technique is utilized to make the conventional and contemporary items.

 The procedure begins by drying the grass. Both the Moonj and Kaasa grass are dried under the sun for 2 days.  Dried Moonj grass is made into little bunches which are called 'Hotshot' locally. This Balla is absorbed virus water for quite a while prior to winding to guarantee adaptability.  The grass Kaasa is utilized as inside stuffing, wherein Moonj is utilized to fold over Kaasa grass to make coil.  The formed coil is short of breath in an arrangement to make the base of bin. When the base is shaped, the dividers of the crate are made utilizing a similar method.  These coils are stitched together to make the basket strong. The motif patterns are created by using colored grass.  The handles of the basket are made and attached by stitching with the grass. Dyeing is done to color the grass.  Kaccha rang-raw colors are used to dye the grass.  Water is boiled at high temperature in aluminum container and the color powder is added to it.  The dried off-white Moonj grass is immersed in the boiling solution to absorb the color.

 During the dyeing process salt is added to the boiling solution as it helps to sustain the color for a longer period.  The grass is removed once it attains color and allowed to dry under shade. The dyed grass is mainly used to create and highlight the motif patterns. Red and green are the two main dominating colors used in basket weaving. Purple, brown, pink colors are rarely used as per the customer requirement. 5. Project Components: 5.1. Land- The approximate total area required for complete small scale factory setup is 1000-1200Sq. ft. approximately. 5.2. Civil Work- Micro, small and medium enterprises are engaged in this work accounting for the total manufacturing units.  Workshop Area- This area includes the machinery setup and foundation space for all equipments, work floor area, and

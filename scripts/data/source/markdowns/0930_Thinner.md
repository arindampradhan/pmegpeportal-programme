THINNER Introduction: A paint thinner is a solvent used to thin oil-based paints or clean up after their use. Commercially, solvents labeled "Paint Thinner" are usually mineral spirits having a flash point at about 40 °C (104 °F), the same as some popular brands of charcoal starter. Thinner provide good adhesion and good gloss, and are durable, highly resistant to scuffs and scrapes and (when used with a primer) are excellent for blocking stains. Thinners are solvents that can dissolve paint and reduce viscosity of paint or “thin” it for use in sprayer applicators or when simply needing a thinner mixture to work with. Uses & Market Potential: Thinner is used to remove oil-based paint from brushes, rollers, equipment, and surfaces. However, there are many other applications and uses for paint thinner saving money and time. Thinner can be used to clean your equipment and tools once you have finished your job,

especially when you have been using oil-based paint. Paint thinner can also be used to 'thin' or reduce the viscosity of paint so it can be used in sprayer applicators. Another important use that most people are not aware of, is that thinner can be used to prevent paint from hardening when it has been left open. Paint thinners should not be used with latex paints, shellac or lacquers. The uses and applications are discussed due to which the demand for this product is never ending and is used widely in all sectors such as industrial, household, etc. Machinery & equipments: Major machines are as follows: Name Unit Price Mixer Vessel 1 340000 Storage Tanks 6 390000 Filling and capping machine 1 520000 Other equipments(pumps,weighing Ls 50000 machine, etc.) Raw materials: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Toluene 2. Naphtha 3. Turpentine oil 4. Acetone 5. Minerals 6. Other additives 7. Packing material Average raw material cost is between 45 to 50 Rs. per Ltr.

Manufacturing Process:  Raw materials are filled in their respective storage vessels  Definite quantity as per formulation is fed to mixer vessel  Mixer vessel mixes all material at required temperature for required time  Product is then filled in appropriate containers by filling machine  Appropriate capping machine is used to close the containers  Product is ready for sale Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs.(Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp. Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 7 including 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker , 1 Helper, 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

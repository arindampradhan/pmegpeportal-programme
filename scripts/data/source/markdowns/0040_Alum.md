ALUM MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Alums are hydrated double sulphate salt of aluminum with the general formula X (Al2SO4)2. 12 H2O, where “X” can be a monovalent cation such as the Potassium or the Ammonium cation. However, the tripositive ion, aluminum, are also replaced by Chromium and Iron ions. The name “Alum” is also more generally used for salts with the same chemical formula and structure, except for the fact that aluminum is replaced by other tri-positive metal ions such as Chromium (III), example being Chrome Alum which is K Cr(SO4)2ꞏ12H2O. Those containing Iron sulphate are termed as “Ferric Alum” while those that contain Chromium and Aluminum Sulphate are called “Non-Ferric Alum”. By itself, “Alum” generally refers to Potassium Alum with the formula K (Al2SO4)2. 12 H2O. Other alums are named after the monovalent cation that is present in the compound such as the Sodium alum when sodium cation is present, Ammonium alum when ammonium ions are present, etc. The cheapest grade of Alum is called “Alum Cake”. Potash Alum is also known as “Alum Alumen”. Though Alum can be recovered from its naturally occurring minerals like Alunite and Kalinite, but they are not much available in India.

Uses & Market Potential: The commercial uses of the alum stem from the hydrolysis of the aluminum ions in the alum to form aluminum hydroxide which precipitates out in the medium. In the paper industries, paper is sized by depositing aluminum hydroxide from the alum in the interstices of the Cellulose fiber. In the Clothing industries, it is used as a mordant (binder) to fix the dyes to the cottons and other types of fabrics, rendering the dye insoluble. The most common alum which is Aluminum Potassium Sulphate. It is also known as Potash Alum, Alum flour, or Alum meal. It finds extensive usage in different industries which is the major driving factor for the growth of the Alum Market. Alums are natural astringents that have the ability to constrict the body tissues and restrict blood flow. Owing to this, it is added to many drugs and thus finds application in the pharmaceutical industry. It also has antiperspirant and antimicrobial properties and thus also used as a deodorant. It is because of this that it is a common ingredient in many Soap formulations. It is a great dye fixative and thus aids in strong fixation of the dyes to a fabric and thus valued in the Dye industries as a mordant. Along with this it also finds usage in the Paper, Fabric, and Chemical industries. Potash alum also finds usage in the water treatment industries due to its antimicrobial properties and also due to its coagulating properties. In agricultural industry, aluminum potassium sulphate is known for enriching the potassium content in the soil when added to the fertilizers. Thus, it can be concluded that Potash Alum finds usage as an ingredient in different industries and thus the global market for Potash Alum is expected to record a steady growth in the forecast period of 2020 – 2030. Product: Alum (Phitkari)

Raw Material: Raw material that is used are Bauxite, Potassium Sulphate, Concentrated Sulphuric Acid, Potassium Sulphate, Distilled Water, Flaked glue and Black Ash. Manufacturing Process: Washing Crushing Charging Settling Filteration Crystallization Concentration Alum Formation Drying Packaging Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500-2000Sqft.

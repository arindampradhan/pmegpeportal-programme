SWITCH MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: Electrical switches are household consumables items. A switch is an electrical component that can break an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another. When the switch is open, the electrical contacts do not touch and electricity cannot flow. When the switch is closed, however, the electrical contacts touch and electricity flows throughout the circuit. In almost every application, for residential, commercial or industrial use, switches are required to be installed. Electrical switches are used to perform all the electrical functions. From a fan to bulb, every electrical equipment we use in our day to day life is useless without a switch. Switch is an electrical component which can make or break electrical circuit automatically or manually. Switch is mainly works with ON (open) and OFF (closed) mechanism. Numerous circuits hold switches that control how the circuit works or actuate different characteristics of the circuit. The classification of switches depends on the connection they make. SPST (Single Pole Single throw), SPDT (single pole double throw), DPST (double pole, single throw), DPDT (double pole double throw). There are different types of electrical switches are available for different types of applications.

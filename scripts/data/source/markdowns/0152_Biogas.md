BIOGAS Introduction: Biogas is a flammable gas that accrues from the fermentation of biomass in biogas plants. Biogas typically refers to a gas produced by the biological breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Biogas originates from biogenic material and is a type of biofuel. Biogas is a renewable source of energy. Organic waste such as dead plant and animal material, animal dung and kitchen waste can be converted into a gaseous fuel called biogas. Biogas comprises primarily methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) moisture and siloxanes. The gases methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide(CO) can be combusted or oxidised with oxygen. Biogas can be used as a fuel for any heating purpose such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat. Biogas can be compressed much like natural gas, and used to power motor vehicles.

Biogas Plant: A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats waste or energy crops. Biogas can be produced using anaerobic digesters. A biogas plant consists of the following things:  Concrete tank (digester)- The bio wastes are digested here by the microbes here so as obtain the methane gas.  Floating Cover- It is placed over the tank and it keeps on rising as the quantity of gas keeps on increasing in the tank.  Outlet – The outlet is connected to a pipe through which the gas is extracted and further used  Slurry Collector- Here cow dung is added to rest of the bio waste with water and as Cowdung which contains bacteria methanogens, which is present in the rumen part of the stomach of cattle, that acts the bio wastes and produce methane gas.  Sludge Collector- The Spent slurry is removed through this section and can be used as fertilizer for various purposes. Uses & Market Potential: Biogas is environment friendly and has various applications. They are cooking, drying, cooling, heating etc. It is used in producing electricity, methanol and production of steam. Below are the same other biogas uses in different fields:  Biogas for home  Biogas for electricity  Provides decentralised fuel supply and waste management.  Gas is useful as a fuel substitute for fire wood, dung, agricultural residues, petrol diesel and electricity.  Best boon in waste management.  Bio-CNG

Biogas has emerged as a promising renewable technology to convert agricultural, animal, industrial and municipal wastes into energy. Biogas development can be integrated with strategies to improve sanitation as well as reduce indoor air pollution and greenhouse gases. Currently, the total biogas production in India is 2.07 billion m3/year. Biomass is one of the major energy sources used in rural India covering nearly 96% of energy sources, however its utilization is highly inefficient due to a lack of proper stoves in most households. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Crop waste 2. Animal waste 3. Municipal waste 4. Agro-industry waste 5. Forest waste Assuming average raw material cost per Kg Rs. 3 -5. Machinery requirement: Major machinery & equipments are: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Biogas Plant 1 1000000 2. FRP Tank (5 m x 5 m) 1 115000 3. Surry Storage Tank (5m x 5m) 1 115000 4. Sledge Pump to Pump the waste 1 95000 5. Crusher Machine (5 HP) 1 325000 6. Excavation 1 50000 Total Amount 1700000

Manufacturing Process: Biogas Production Process (Food Waste & Cow dung) The various food waste are procured form agro-industry & municipal bodies, while the Cow dung is obtained from dairy farms & farmer groups. All these raw material are stored in appropriate storage facilities composed of bins and appropriate enclosing structure. The food waste is sent to crusher which essentially crushes the various sizes food waste into an appropriate size & form to be used for making slurry. This crushed food waste, along with Cow dung is added to slurry tank with water. The slurry tank has its own agitator to form a uniform slurry. The Slurry is then pumped into digester of biogas plant which essentially decomposes the organic waste, releasing mostly methane and other gases, which are collectively called as biogas. The gas deposits in dome or floating cover, from where it’s extracted via flow control valve periodically. The used slurry or sludge is pumped out of digester into a sludge tank which can be used as manure. The biogas is collected in a large gas receiver from, where it’s sucked in by compressor and collected in its receiver, which acts as a temporary holding tank. This gas is then either filled in gas cylinders utilizing appropriate pressure regulator & valves; which are later sold or gas is simply filled in a large pressure vessel from where the supply is provided to customers via regulator & pipeline arrangement. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required

for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Fire/pollution license as required  PESO License  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if required.

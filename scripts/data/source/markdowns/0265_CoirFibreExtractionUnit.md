PROJECT PROFILE FOR COIR FIBRE EXTRACTION UNIT INTRODUCTION Coir product by virtue of its eco-friendly and biodegradable qualities are increasingly getting world wide acceptance. The basic raw material of the industry, i.e., “Coconut husk” is abundantly available at negligible cost in major coconut growing states of India. It is estimated that as of now only 40%-45% of the raw material availability i.e., the coconut husk is put into coir industrial use. Hence, there is a vast unused potentiality available in coconut growing states of India for extraction of coir fiber and its further processing. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE In the common method of mechanical extraction of coir fibre from the coconut husk , the husks sprinkled with water and kept for a few hours are first processed in a buster (disintegrator) by which about 60% disintegration of fibre takes place. The husk fed from the chute provided at the top of the machine are smashed against a wall or wooden plank fixed. Followed to this, the disintegrated husks are fed to a beater to complete the extraction of fibre. The fibre thus extracted is cleaned using a revolving screener/sifter. On an average about 25000 husk could be processed per shift of 8 hours in this method.

MARKET Coir fibre extracted from coconut husk has extensive use in almost all coir activities and it is the basic raw material for manufacturing of different varieties of Coir yarn. The economic and pollution control issues have almost arrested the traditional way of coir retting and fibre extractions. Hence, now a day’s industry purely depends upon the fibre produced by mechanical device from Green/Dry coconut husk. In this context, fibres extracted under this method have good demands and market in order to carry out all coir based activities. BASIS AND PRESUMTIONS • The Project Profile is based on 8 working hours in a day and 25 days in a month and the Break Even efficiency has been calculated on 75%, 80%, 85% and 90% capacity utilization. • The rate of interest both for fixed asset and working capital have been taken as 11.5% p.a. • Interest for margin money is calculated 1st half year (considering the time taken for margin money to be placed as FDR) • The Margin money is deducted from the 4th year beginning. • TECHNICAL ASPECTS Installed Production capacity per shift : 2.5 tons of coir fiber per day Working days p.a : 300 days Husk requirement of per ton of fiber : 12000 husk per ton Cost of husk : Rs.1.80 per husk

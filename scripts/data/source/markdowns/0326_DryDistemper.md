DRY DISTEMPER Introduction: Distemper is a water based paint in which the binding medium consists essentially of either glue or casein, or similar sizing material. The major constituents of distemper are chalk, lime, water and some coloring agents if necessary. They are also known as cement paint. This is called so because such kind of paint can be applied directly on cement walls without any other coating on them. They are a cheaper option and they stay good for more than 5 years. Distempers are used for both interior and exterior walls usually needing two coatings. The distempers are available in powdered form or paste form. They are to be mixed with hot water before use. Features of Distemper: Following are the features:  It has a distinct property by the virtue of which it allows the moisture to escape from the surface to which it is applied.

 It is easy to apply and can be applied directly on the plastered surface.  It can easily be cleaned by using a mild solution of detergent.  It is not flexible in nature.  It has a low VOC Content.  It is not water-resistant but provides a matte smooth finish. Composition of Distemper: The composition of Distemper includes the following: i. Base/Body: Chalk or lime is used as a base of distemper paint. ii. Vehicle/Binder: Various types of resins such as acrylic resins, alkyl resins and epoxy resins are used as the vehicles in the distemper paint. iii. Inert Filler/Extender: Various colouring pigments are used as the extenders in the distemper paint. Usually the colouring pigments used are larger in size than the ordinary secondary fine particles. iv. Pigments: Mostly the powdered mineral colours are used as the pigment in the distemper paints. v. Thinner/Solvent: In the distemper paint, the solvent used is water. vi. Additive: Mostly, the alkali resistance substances are used as the additives in the distemper paint. Assuming average raw material cost between 20-25 Kg. Machines & equipments: Major machines are as follows: Name Unit Price Ball mill 1 120000 Dry Powder mixer 1 150000 Slurry mixer 1 45000 Dehydrator/Evaporating Tower 1 1000000 Other machines & equipments Ls 85000

Manufacturing Process: Raw materials required for production are procured from the market. The materials which are in solid form are grinded in the ball mill. After grinding the next process is to pour the grinded material in slurry mixer. Once the process in slurry mixer is completed than the material is ready for the next stage in which the required mixture passes through Dehydrator/Evaporating Tower. After this fillers are added to the powder mixer. The required material is than packed in 5 kg , 10 kg packets and are ready for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1000 to 1500Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 5 Lac Rs. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp. Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker , 1 Helper, 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

1. INTRODUCTION Acetylene is an organic compound that belongs to the category called “Hydrocarbons” and has the chemical formula C H . It is gaseous in nature, is colourless, odorless, and is the simplest 2 2 “Alkene”. It is widely used as a fuel as also used as the starting material for the preparation of a number of other compounds. It is highly unstable in the natural form as is thus handled in the form of solution. Since the gas is odorless, the commercial grade have odor due to the presence of impurities such as phosphine and divinyl sulfide. This gas was initially prepared in the year 1836 by Edmund Davy and this was an accidental discovery while attempting to isolate the Potassium metal. Since the 1950s, this gas is being prepared by the Partial Combustion of the methane. It is recovered as a Side Product in the production of Ethylene by Cracking of Hydrocarbons. Its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison the Ziegler-Natta Catalysts. For this reason, it is selectively hydrogenated to ethylene using Palladium-Silver catalysts. It was prepared by the hydrolysis of calcium carbide, a reaction discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in 1862 and still familiar to students:

Ca C + 2H O → Ca (OH) + C H ↑ 2 2 2 2 2 Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000 °C, necessitating the use of an electric arc furnace. At atmospheric pressure, acetylene cannot exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point. At room temperature, the solubility of acetylene in acetone in 27.9 g per kg. For the same amount of dimethylformamide (DMF), the solubility is 51 g. At 20.26 bar, the solubility increases to 689.0 and 628.0 g for acetone and DMF, respectively. These solvents are used in pressurized gas cylinders. Acetylene is the most efficient of all fuel gases and provides high levels of productivity due to the fact that it requires the least amount of oxygen to ensure complete combustion. A low flame moisture content makes this a good choice for many critical industrial heating processes such as flame heating, flame gouging, welding, flame hardening, flame cleaning, flame straightening, thermal spraying, spot heating, brazing, texturing, profile-cutting, branding wooden pallets, wood aging, and carbon coating. It is the only fuel gas that is recommended for underground working conditions as it is lighter than air. It is also the only fuel gas, for instance, that can weld steel. In cutting, Oxy-acetylene flame gives the fastest pre-heating piercing times than any other fuel gas combination. Some of the major benefits of using the Oxy-Acetylene flame are:  Improved Cut Quality  Higher cutting speeds  Fastest cut initiation time  Reduced oxygen use. Acetylene being a Flammable gas, there are certain safety requirements associated with it. It is for this reason that the regulator for this gas is different from the regulators used for other gases. It is due to this reason that the gas is dissolved in liquid acetone. The liquid acetone is then stored in the acetylene cylinder, which in turn, is filled with a porous (sponge-like) cementitious material. Copper metal catalyzes the decomposition of acetylene and as a result acetylene is not to be transported in copper pipes. Brass pipe fittings are also to be avoided.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Some of the common uses of the Acetylene gases can be listed as below: 1. Acetylene is the “Only” fuel gas that is used for welding purpose. 2. It is also used for brazing, cutting, flame gouging, spot heating, hardening, texturing, cleaning, and thermal spraying many materials. 3. The glass and the materials processing industries often use acetylene gas for carbon coating as it provides a lubricated surface between two materials. 4. Acetylene is mixed with oxygen or air to produce a graphitic and amorphous carbon coating that loosely adheres to the surface. 5. It is used in the laboratories as fuel gas in different instruments like Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. 6. It is used for the manufacture of different other chemicals in the industries. 7. In the late 1800s, acetylene was for the first time used to light a portable lamp known as a carbide or acetylene gas lamp. These lamps were installed on cars, in homes, on bicycles, etc. They were also used extensively by miners. In some cases, acetylene was used to light some cities and towns. In the lamps, calcium carbide and water are used to produce acetylene. The flow of the acetylene is carefully monitored to control the amount of acetylene used. 8. It is useful in the production of polyethylene plastics, PVC, and PVDF. These chemicals are produced from ethylene, which in turn is derived from acetylene. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process for Acetylene gas by the Calcium Carbide Process is as given below: 1. The process begins with the procuring of Calcium Carbide for the process. Calcium carbide vigorously reacts with water to form the Acetylene gas. So the removal of the excess amount of heat from the reaction chamber is very important. There are several variations of

this process in which either calcium carbide is added to water or the water is added to the calcium carbide. There is a third process in which a limited amount of water is added and is called the Dry Process which is mentioned here. 2. A high capacity Acetylene Generator is used for this purpose. The generator uses a rotating screw to feed calcium carbide granules into the reaction chamber which has been filled upto a certain level with water. The granules measure about 2mm x 8mm, providing the right amounts of exposure to allow for a complete reaction. he feed rate is determined by the desired rate of gas flow and is controlled by a pressure switch in the chamber. If too much gas is being produced at one time, the pressure switch opens and cuts back the feed rate. 3. To ensure that complete reaction takes place, the reaction chamber is agitated by a set of rotating paddles inside the reaction chamber. These paddles also prevent any granule from floating on the top of the water surface that may overheat and cause explosion. 4. The acetylene gas, bubbles to the top of the surface and is removed and is drawn off under low pressure. As it leaves the reaction chamber, the gas is cooled by a spray of water. This water spray also adds water to the reaction chamber to keep the reaction going as new calcium carbide is added. After the gas is cooled, it passes through a flash arrester, which prevents any accidental ignition from equipment downstream of the chamber. 5. As the calcium carbide reacts with the water, it forms a slurry of calcium carbonate, which sinks to the bottom of the chamber. Periodically the reaction must be stopped to remove the built-up slurry. The slurry is drained from the chamber and pumped into a holding pond, where the calcium carbonate settles out and the water is drawn off. 6. There is an ammonia scrubber that uses water in removing any ammonia that might be present in the acetylene system. This is done to make the Acetylene purification system last longer. 7. The acetylene gas is dried by passing it through a calcium carbide chamber at medium pressure. The dried acetylene gas is then passed through acetylene purifier which removes any kind of impurities such as phosphine, arsine, and hydrogen sulphide, etc. This step can be bypassed for industrial grade acetylene. 8. Finally the purified acetylene gas passes through purification scrubbers to remove any traces of the purification material. 9. The acetylene then enters the compressor and is raised from the inlet pressure to desired final cylinder pressure through 3-stages of compression

10. The acetylene stream passes through a set of high-pressure driers that remove any traces of oil and perform moisture removal. Without this final moisture removal, water would be transferred to the cylinders. 11. As the acetylene travels at high pressure to the manifolds it passes through flame arresters on each side of every shutoff valve. In high pressure, acetylene valves are the cause of most ignitions and the flame arresters are positioned to stop the flame as quick as possible therefore limiting the potential for damage to the system. 12. The acetylene is compressed into a cylinder at a pressure of about 300 psi (2,070 k Pa) that has liquid acetone and porous monolithic mass filler. This acetone in the filler allows there to be 25 times more acetylene in the cylinder than if there was no acetone. Once dissolved, it loses its explosive capability, making it safe to transport. When the cylinder valve is opened, the pressure drop causes some of the acetylene to vaporize into gas again and flow through the connecting hose to the welding or cutting torch. 13. The ratio of acetone and acetylene will always be constant, but the total amount of acetone will vary due to cylinder size. 14. The air compressor supplies compressed air to operate the acetone pump, lime slurry pump and the actuated ball valves in the acetylene plant. 15. The thickened calcium carbonate is then dried and sold for use as an industrial waste water treatment agent, acid neutralizer, or soil conditioner for road construction. 16. Acetylene gas being a highly explosive gas, it must be handled with great safety. When it is transported through pipelines, the pressure is kept very low any the length of the pipelines is kept very short. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2500-3000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.25000 to 30000 per month.

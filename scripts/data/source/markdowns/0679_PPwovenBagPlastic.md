PP WOVEN BAG Introduction Woven fabric is a textile formed by weaving. It is produced on a loom, and made of many threads woven on a warp and a weft. Woven polypropylene or simply woven PP bags are considered to be the toughest packaging bags, widely used to pack materials for grain, milling and sugar industry. PP oriented strips are becoming increasingly popular in India & have caught the eye of many end users for their requirement of packing materials. They have become popular on account of their inertness towards chemical, moisture & excellent resistance towards rotting & fungus attack. They are non-toxic. Lighter in weight & have more advantages than conventional bags. Product Application and uses HDPE/PP Woven bags ideally suitable for Building Materials, Cement, fertilizers, Urea, Potash, plastic, polymers, plastic pellets, etc. Food grains: Rice, Wheat, Pulses, Tea, Coffee, Beans, Peanuts, Sand, Sugar. Chemicals: Pigments, Dyestuffts, oxides, barytes, alumina, hydrates, ores, gypsum, feldspar, mica, Lime, limestone, Woven Packaging Fabrics, Woven bags and fabrics are often used as an industrial

packaging material. The packaging bags and fabrics are available mostly in HDPE (High Density Polythene) and PP (Polypropylene). Depending on end use these are either laminated, or supplied without lamination. These materials are valuable for applications in many different industries. Any entrepreneur venture into this field will be successful. Benefits of PP Woven Bag Some of the strong features of PP bags/Sheets are noted here:  Protects Products or commodities, ensuring safe storage  Extends the shelf Life  Prevents spoilage  Eco-friendly and pocket-friendly  100% reusable and durable  Light in weight and flexible  Excellent resistance to stress and high resistant to cracking  Humidity and Dust proof  Easy to clean and anti-bacterial  Breathable or water proof with a laminated film  Can be colored or printed  Can be stored in an open area. PP Woven Bag Market Analysis At present there is underutilization of existing capacity due to marketing problems after introducing of Jute packaging Mandatory Order 1986. The demand for woven sacks is sluggish for a variety of reasons. A few years back Flat looms were used for the manufacture of woven sacks. Now it has been manufactured on circular looms, which have high productivity. This helped in minimizing the cost of production; however due to high cost of jute bags & also due to resistance to chemicals.

Moisture etc. most of industry prefer HDPE/PP woven sacks for packaging. The polypropylene woven bags and sacks market to record a moderate 4.0% volume CAGR through the period of forecast, 2018 to 2028. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for PP Woven Bag manufacturing process:  3 colour woven bag flexo printer: 6 colour woven bag printer can be taken instead of 3 colour flexo printer (at larger scale).  PP woven bag cutting machine  Manual stitching machine Manufacturing Process 1. First you need to fix pp role in printing machine, for the printing of company name logo, manufacturing date etc. 2. For print you need to add different types of flexo ink, then need to add stereo (which is a rubber plate) which is used to print companies profile on bags. 3. Then you need cutting machine to cut this pp role according to the required size. 4. After cutting bags transfer to stitching section to stitch bags with the help of stitching machine. 5. Final checking of product. 6. Then bags are ready and can be transfer to the packaging section.

PROJECT REPORT ON ‘ENERGY FOODS’ PRODUCT AND APPLICATIONS Health awareness is fast growing and people are taking to such energy supplements to overcome ageing, tiredness, fatigue and general breakdown of the system. Various supplements are available in the market to lower fats increase stamina etc. People are very conscious of Cholesterol level in blood and avoid fatty foods. They are very selective of their diet and there is marked preference for low calorie high protein food supplements. The energy foods available in market are costly and beyond the reach of common man. Children are yet another group for cheap energy foods. The technology for such foods has been developed by CFTRI. India’s rural population is subject to three common forms of nutritional deprivation: 1. Inadequacy of food intake among the poorer segment leading to calorie deficiency 2. The extra nutritional need of infants and preschool children 3. Deficiency of specific micronutrients such as Vitamin A and iron Energy food is prepared from easily available ingredients like wheat, gram dal, jiggery, edible ground nut cake, minerals and vitamins. It is a ready to eat food item and does not require extensive cooking. Depending upon individuals tastes some milk or water can be added. It can also be used with other material while making food items like halwa, chapatti etc.

MARKET POTENTIAL Urban market is targeted by the costly variety of energy foods which are generally beyond the reach of semi urban and rural population. A large market exists for such products in rural and semi urban areas. With greater health awareness and contamination of raw vegetables due to pesticides and other chemical fertilizers people prefer diet foods. Thus easy availability at reasonable price provides a large market with the vast rural and semi urban population. MANUFACTURING PROCESS & KNOW HOW The process of manufacturing is not very complicated. Cleaned wheat is roasted in a roaster bin to brown colour and then ground in a hammer mill. Similarly gram dal and edible ground nut cake are also roasted and ground. Next jiggery is mixed with calcium carbonate and wheat flour and processed in multi mill to obtain coarse flour. Finally are the ingredients along with pre-mixed minerals and vitamins are thoroughly mixed and packed. A typical mix could be 60% wheat flour, 10% gram dal, 10% edible ground nut cake, 15-16% jiggery and balance calcium carbonate and vitamins. Quality control is a must. The process flow chart is as under Know how is available with Central Government research Laboratories. The machinery is all indigenously available. The production capacity envisaged is 200 tonnes per annum on two shift basis for 330 days per year.

The unit will also require miscellaneous assets such as furniture, fixtures, storage facilities etc. The total requirement of power shall be 30 HP, the unit will need 1000 lits of water daily. RAW MATERIAL AND PACKING MATERIAL The basic raw materials for the unit are good quality wheat, gram dal, edible ground nut cake, jiggery are all available locally. Major requirement is that of wheat and for which advance bulk procurement shall have to be made. Printed polythene bags and packing cartons are the basic packing material required. On an average the raw material cost has been estimated to be Rs.180 lakhs at 100% capacity utilization. LAND AND BUILDING For smooth operation of the unit, it will require 250 sq. mts of open land and a built up area of 150 sq. Mts. The building is taken on rent . FSSAI LICENSE: FSSAI License is issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of Family Health & Welfare, Government of India.

1. INTRODUCTION Electricity plays a vital role in agricultural and industrial growth. Electricity is the primary need for developing and developed nations. Insulators are the most important arrangements for electricity production, distribution, and transmission. An insulator is electrical equipment that does not conduct electrical current. Insulating materials include paper, plastic, rubber, glass, and air. Vacuum is also an insulator but is not material. Most electrical conductors are covered by insulation. Magnet wire is coated with an extremely thin layer of insulation so that more turns or larger wire may be used in the winding of transformers etc. Insulators are generally rated at hundreds of volts, but some that are used in power distribution are rated as high as hundreds of thousands of volts. Insulators support and/or keep electrical conductors from making unintended contact with each other. An insulator made by a hard paste of Porcelain is also known as a true porcelain insulator. Out of all the wide varieties of ceramics & true porcelain is the hardest, the most durable – which is one of the reasons porcelain insulators are largely replaced by glass insulators. Insulators are used to protect us from the dangerous effects of electricity flowing through conductors. Sometimes the voltage in an electrical circuit can be quite high and dangerous.

If the voltage is high enough, electric current can be made to flow through even materials that are generally not considered to be good conductors. Our bodies will conduct electricity and you may have experienced this when you received an electrical shock. Generally, electricity flowing through the body is not pleasant and can cause injuries. The function of our heart can be disrupted by a strong electrical shock and the current can cause burns. Therefore, we need to shield our bodies from the conductors that carry electricity. The rubbery coating on wires is an insulating material that shields us from the conductor inside. 2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Overhead conductors for high-voltage electric power transmission are bare and are insulated by the surrounding air. Conductors for lower voltages in distribution may have some insulation but are often bare as well. Insulating supports called insulators are required at the points where they are supported by utility poles or transmission towers. House, Office, Scholl, Transformers wherever electric circuit is used, insulators are used. Insulators are also required where the wire enters buildings or electrical devices, such as transformers or circuit breakers, to insulate the wire from the case. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps- 1. Raw material procurement 2. Insulator Making Process 3. Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in inventory. Insulator Making Process 1. Grinding: Raw material grinding is done by using a ball mill to make a fine powder.

2. Wet grinding: It is a process of taking materials in a liquid form or slurry and reducing particles, such as agglomerates, by breaking them apart or shearing them down in size. A blunger usually consists of a round or octagonal tank with a mixer. Clay is added to the water-filled blunger and then mixed into a slurry, which is also called slip. 3. Filter pressing: Filter pressing is done to de-water the slurry. In this process, water content is removed from the slurry, and its cake is made. 4. De-airing: Cakes are then fed into a de-airing pug mill. By extrusion process, pugs are made. 5. Shaping: These pugs are molded into the required shape. Shaping is done by pressing or turning 6. Drying: To improve insulator strengths moisture content is removed by drying it. 7. Glazing: The glaze improves mechanical strength and provides a smooth, shiny surface. After a cooling-down period, metal fittings are attached to the porcelain with Portland cement. 8. Heating: Heating or firing is done to convert the raw material mixture is strong and vitreous porcelain. 9. Cutting and grinding: Insulator visual inspection is done and its cutting and grinding are done as per required dimensions. 10. Assembly: which involves fitting terminations to the porcelain shapes, so that they become insulators. 11. Packing: After QC it will be packed in wooden blocks and shipped. Testing Quality control: Testing implies a series of mechanical and electrical tests to ensure the technical integrity of the products. Parallelism, Eccentricity, Visual defects, Dimension, Product-specific requirement, etc. will be tested. 3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500 square meter. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.20,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.800 Sqmt.

 Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 400 Sqmt.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 200 Sqmt. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqmt. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Ball Mill: This machine is used for clay milling. Raw material grinding is done by using this machine. Blunger Machine: This machine is used for mixing slurry. A blunger usually consists of a round or octagonal tank with a mixer. Clay is added to the water-filled blunger and then mixed into slurry.  Filter Pressing Machine: A filter press is a batch operation, fixed volume machine that separates liquids and solids using pressure filtration. Slurry is pumped into the filter press

and dewatered under pressure. It is used for water and wastewater treatment in a variety of different applications ranging from industrial to municipal.  De Airing Pug Mill: The De-Airing Pug mill machine is widely used for Shaping, Pugging, and Extruding ceramic clay by a plastic process where De-airing is necessary. It consists of three chambers in one line. A) feeding and mixing chamber, B) vacuum chamber C) auger chamber.  Insulator Shaping Machine: Used for shaping of the external shape of Insulator.

 Glazing Machine: This machine is designed to dip the insulator in the Glaze bath automatically. The machine consists of 16 to 25 nos dipping arms rotating with the rotation of the housing shaft.  Kiln: A kiln is a thermally insulated chamber, a type of oven, that produces temperatures sufficient to complete some process, such as hardening, drying, or chemical changes. Equipment:

3.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS • Procurement of raw material i.e. Rose petals. • Cleaning of rose petals. • Next step is distillation process, in this process with the help of distillation essential oil is extracted from rose petals and condensed with the help of water. • In distillation process furnace or heater, heating vessels or heating tank, cooling tank or condenser is used. Usually separator is used in distillation process but in this project rose water is manufactured so, one storage tank is enough. • Distillation process is executed in heating vessel by putting rose petals and water together and this process is repeated many times with same water and flowers for essential oil extraction. • Filling of rose water in bottles and labelling on bottles. 4. PROJECT COMPONENTS 4.1 Land Land required is 1200-1500 square feet approx. Approximate rent for the same is Rs.24,000 – 30,000 per month.

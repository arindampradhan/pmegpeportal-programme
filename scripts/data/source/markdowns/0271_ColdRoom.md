INTRODUCTION In today’s changing global climate scenario, which presents threats to sustainable food production, the need for conservation of resources becomes more relevant. It calls for sustainable and eco-friendly preservation techniques to prevent wastage and maximise utilisation India is the largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world scenario but the availability of fruits and vegetables per capita is significantly low because of Post Harvest loses which account for about 25% to 30% of production. Further, the quality of sizeable quantity of produces also deteriorates the moment it reaches the consumer. This happens because of perishable nature of the products. If consumption is not getting stabilized, the farmers switch over to other crops instead of going for one crop in the subsequent year, and cycle continues. Our farmers continue to remain poor even though they take risk to cultivate high value fruits and vegetables year after year. Introduction of Cold storage / Cold room facility will help them in removing the risk of distress sale and simultaneously will ensure better returns A cold storage room is a great place to store fruits and vegetables, as well as other products, as they prolong the life and help prevent spoilage of foods. Cold Rooms are a great idea as they will keep items much cooler than regular room temperature. This makes cold storage rooms and cooler rooms refrigeration a great choice for storing perishable items. There are several benefits that these units provide, they are also beneficial for both personal and business use. Cold room storage is also essential for several other industries, including the storage of medical and chemical products. The horticulture industry also has a need for cold storage as plant and flower crops often have to be stored below room temperature. OBJECTIVES  To establish the small capacity of cool chamber / cold room in vegetable mandi / markets or in the field of farmers growing vegetables/fruits.  To store the surplus amount of vegetables in daily market for selling the products later.  To reduce the distress sale of the vegetables in the market.  Farmers/Beneficiaries will get profit by selling the vegetables in the market in subsequent days.

NECESSITY OF COLD ROOM In most of the cases the financial condition of the farmers/business man does not permit to establish a cold storage having capacity of 5000 MT or more to store products in the cold storage which require crores of Rupees to establish it. The concept of cold room is to store vegetables, fruits, flowers and other commodities for shorter duration for which a small farmer/business man can store products for shorter period and sell it without deterioration of the product. Farmers will also get appropriate value of the product. It will reduce the distress sale. Since the investment of such cold room is low a farmer/Business man can easily establish a cold room to store his own surplus products or may provide storage facilities to the needed farmers/traders.

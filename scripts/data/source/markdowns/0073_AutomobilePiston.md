AUTOMOBILE PISTON PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: The piston begins as a solid aluminum ingot. The reason aluminum is used is that it's lightweight, rust-proof, and easy to cut. In an Internal Combustion engine, piston converts the thermal energy of fuel into mechanical energy. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. FUNCTIONS & MARKET POTENTIAL: The main functions of the piston are: - (a) To transmit the gas forces via connecting rod to the crank shaft. (b) To seal the clearance in between piston rings and cylinder liner against gas leakage to the crankcase and to prevent the infiltration of oil from crankcase into the combustion chamber. The global automotive piston market size is projected to grow to USD 2.2 billion by 2025 from USD 1.9 billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 3.5%. The shift towards direct gasoline engines (GDI) will lead to demand for gasoline pistons in the coming years. The growth in Automobile sector will directly increase the demand for pistons in the market and is a never ending product.

MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Basic machineries requirement are as follows: 1. Crucible type Tilting Furnace (Electric) 2. Die Casting Machine 3. Band Saw 4. Boring Machine 5. Lathe Machine, Bed length 4’6”, swing dia 350 mm, 1.5 KW / 2 H. P 6. Precision Lathe Machine 7. Pillar type Drilling Machine, 0.5 H. P 8. Tempering Furnace, 400°C 9. Laboratory comprising chemical and physical testing 10. Other machineries and equipment’s RAW MATERIAL: Aluminium Alloys are the preferred material for pistons both in gasoline and diesel engines due to their specific characteristics: - low density, high thermal conductivity, easy machinability, high reliability and very good recycling characteristics. Proper control of the chemical composition, processing conditions and final heat treatment results in a micro structure which ensures the required mechanical and thermal performance, in particular the high thermal fatigue resistance. The standard material for piston is Al-12%Si alloy containing in addition approximately 1% each of Cu, Ni and Mg.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The aluminium alloy is formed into roughly shaped piston body by die casting process. 1. Foundry: Foundry is the beginning of piston manufacturing. At the foundry, die is prepared for taking molten aluminium alloy by heating it to operating temperature for approximately one hour. This process allows the die to readily accept the molten material when it is poured. The process starts by heating the aluminium alloy well above the melting point but below its boiling point, i.e, upto 700°C. Molten aluminium alloy is then poured into the die through sprue. The material is then allowed to cool into the die for solidification, followed by placing it into a bin of hot water. After appropriate cooling the sprue section of casting is cut by a band saw, which is then resent for melting in furnace, while piston body is sent for further machining. 2. Pin Boring: At this stage, the piston casting has the gudgeon pin hole rough machined by a boring machine. 3. Turning: Turning of the piston casting is carried out on precision lathe machines. The castings are placed in the lathe and held in place by a solid rod through the gudgeon pin hole. A draw bolt is activated in the chuck which draws the rod towards chuck and holds the piston in place during its machining. The piston is now ready for finishing processes. 4. Drilling: The process includes drilling of oil holes in gudgeon pin bosses and oil ring grooves, cutting slots in the skirt, valve relieving and crank relieving.

5. Finishing Process (a) Grinding: This process involves the final size being machined on the piston. The process involved is cam grinding which machines the skirt of the piston only. (b) Reaming: This is the final machining process which involves the piston being placed in a bath of oil and reamed to reach the final size required. 6. Final Inspection: At this stage, the piston is cleaned, then size and category are stamped and then sent for dispatch.

WOOD CRAFTING UNIT Introduction: The wood carving artistry is about 400 years old. The products showcase the skill of the craftsmen of the region and intricate designs and carvings chiseled on wood, mostly sheesham wood being the raw material of choice. The most common varieties used to make Indian handicrafts are teak, sheesham, sal, oak, mango, ebony and mahogany. Sandalwood, rosewood and walnut are the exotic varieties and are expensive and are used in producing fine pieces of furniture and decorative items. These materials may have revolutionized the furniture industry, but wood is undeniably a staple material in furniture manufacturing. Uses & Market Potential: It may be noted that the woodworking industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Indian economy. According to a study by the World Bank, India's organized furniture industry is expected to grow 20% per annum over the next few years and is projected to cross USD 32 billion by 2019, while the luxury furniture market is expected to garner $27.01 billion by 2020, registering a CAGR of 4.1% during the forecast period 2015- 2020.

furniture board and particle board) and decorative surface products such as laminates. The Indian wood panel industry is estimated to be around INR 28,000 crore and is growing at the rate of 10-12% annually. This is driven by a healthy demand for wood panels, mainly for new housing construction (90% of the total demand) and the remaining (10%) from renovation activity. Engineered wood furniture goods are also gaining popularity in Indian cities. The leading cause of this is a rise in demand for ready to assemble furniture in towns. Moreover, the ease of buying from the E-commerce platform is also encouraging the growth of modular and multifunctional furniture in the market for home decoration and convenience purposes.

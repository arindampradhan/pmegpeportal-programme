1. INTRODUCTION Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colours and in many different types, such as water colour or synthetic. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. Enamel paint is paint that air-dries to a hard, usually glossy, finish, used for coating surfaces that are outdoors or otherwise subject to hardware or variations in temperature. Powder coating has largely replaced baked enamel coating for industrial applications. Enamel paint's main competition came when synthetic latex paints were introduced after World War II. Today, enamel paint still has some associations with hard-shelled items such as large appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, though these too are now powder-coated. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Some of the most common uses of the Enamel paints can be listed as below: 1. Enamel coatings provide a hard and glossy finish. They are used for coating surfaces that are outdoors or otherwise subject to variations in temperature. 2. Enamel paint can be used on copper, metal surfaces, glass, wood, plastic, and even walls. 3. Enamel paint is resistant to moisture, and is perfect for surfaces that need to be washed multiple times.

4. The enamel paint is used to pleasing surface design and appearance. 5. Enamel paint are used to protect wooden article from wet root and other type of defects. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Production Process  Raw Material Procurement: Procurement is the connection process of purchasing and arranging in bound movement of all items, supplies, materials, parts, finished inventory and general support services from the suppliers into manufacturing process or assembly plants or warehouses.  Production Process Steps involved in the manufacturing of Enamel paint Manufacturing unit:  Raw material: The major raw materials for enamel paint are resin, pigment and additive.  Mixing: Resin, pigment and solvent are mixed to produce an even base mill.  Milling: Mill base are produced as a pre mixing process to disperse the pigment particle.  Blending: Resin and additive agent is used to mix with mill base so that dispersion get completed. The colour phase is adjusted through this process.  Filtering: Remove the unblended particle from the toned paint.  Packaging: Filtered paint is packaged into the container 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.20,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.800 Sqft.

 Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 400 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 200 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Mixing Chamber: The mixing chamber machine mix an equal amount of pigment and solvent to obtained a mill baseball product which further proceed for blending process.  Blending Machine: Blending machine are used to blend the Resin, additive is added to complete the dispersion of the paint colour.  Paint Filter Machine: The filter machine is used to remove oversize contamination from the paint

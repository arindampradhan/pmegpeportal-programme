SAFETY PIN MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The safety pin is a type of normal pin that has a basic spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp has two purposes: it forms a complete loop, properly securing the pin to whatever it is applied to, and it protects the user from the sharp tip by covering the end of the pin. To attach pieces of fabric or clothes together, safety pins are frequently employed. Safety pins, or a special variant with an additional protective cover known as a nappy pin, or loincloth pin, are extensively used to secure cloth diapers (nappies) or contemporary loincloths because the safety clasp prevents the infant from being poked, while remaining an ingestion danger. A sharpened pin is fastened to a coiled wire and is linked to a cap that is hooked at the wire's end. Pushing the pin into the cap's aperture seals the pin's safety, and the clasp is closed.

2. Baby Boiler Boilers are basically used in dairy industry for heating of milk and milk pasteurization. Milk boilers ensures good shelf life. 3. Raw Material Bin These equipments are class of storage equipments which are specifically designed for dry raw material of small granule composition. 4. Industrial Mixer Grinder This machine is used to mix various ingredients in appropriate quantities and help in the process of making baby cereal milk powder. It is a multipurpose machine used for various grains, rice, etc.

5. Homogenizer This equipment is used in the production of liquid mixtures in which the said mixture, is forced through a small passage at high velocity. This machine reduces solute globule size to a very small size in order to prevent aggregate formation. 6. Spray Drier with Atomizer Spray drier use some type of atomizer or spray nozzle to disperse the liquid or slurry into a controlled drop size spray. This machine helps in producing a dry powder from a liquid. It is used for products such as starch, rice, corn, etc. 7. Can Washing Machine

RAW MATERIAL: Basic Raw Material requirement are as follows: 1. Milk 2. Rice 3. Wheat 4. Oats 5. Cans 6. Chemicals like Preservatives MANUFACTURING PROCESS: The General procedure is as follow: • Mixing Ingredients: The primary ingredients are blended in huge stainless-steel tanks and are mixed together along with milk at temperature of 60°C. Then other fat, minerals, nutrients are added. Some additional heating and mixing may be required to get proper consistency. When mixing process is completed then the mixed material is transported to pasteurization equipment. • Pasteurization: This process is very helpful as it protects the mixture from getting spoiled, by removing or eliminating bacteria, yeast and molds. The mixture is quickly heated and then cooled under controlled conditions, in which micro-organism cannot survive. The heating temperature is around 85-95°C for approximately 30 seconds. • Homogenization: This process enhances emulsion uniformly which helps in reducing the size of the fat and oil particles in the formula. This process is performed by a variety of mixing equipments which apply shear load at the product and this mixing breaks fat and other particles to a very small size.

• Standardization: This process is used to ensure that the key parameters like Ph, vitamins and mineral content are correct. If the level is insufficient the levels are reworked to make it adequate. • Sterilization: The formula is heated to maintain its bacteriologic quality so that the product quality is not hampered. In this the formula is heated at a temperature of 118°C for 10-15 mins. • Dry Blending: This process can be performed through spray dryers. In this process the ingredients are received in a dehydrated powdered form and are mixed together to achive a uniform blend of the macro and micro nutrients necessary for a complete infant formula product. • Packaging: This process basically depends upon the equipments used but commonly the product is packed in different size of cans or small tins which can be easily sold in a retail market.

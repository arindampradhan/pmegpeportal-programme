POPCORN MAKING UNIT Introduction: Popcorn (popped corn, popcorns or pop-corn) is a variety of corn kernel, which expands and puffs up when heated. A popcorn kernels strong hull contains the seed's hard, starchy endosperm with 14–20% moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated. Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to forcefully expand from 20 to 50 times its original size—and finally, cool. Each kernel of popcorn contains a certain amount of moisture and oil. Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is both strong and impervious to moisture and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard type. Benefits & Market Potential: 1. It helps to lose weight. 2. It can keep blood sugar in check.

3. It contains whole grains. 4. Popcorn are full of vitamins & minerals. 5. It prevent disease & boast eyesight. The popularity of popcorn as a snack is growing across the country and can be seen as more and more retail stores are increasing the number of ready-to-eat popcorn packets kept in their shelves. The global popcorn market is projected to reach $15billion by 2023, registering a CAGR of 7.6 percent from 2017 to 2023, with ready-to-eat leading the segment. While established FMCG businesses have either launched a popcorn product or are looking to launch one, startups too have built ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook popcorn brands in the domain. Description of Machinery & Equipment: Following machines are required for Popcorn manufacturing unit 1. Popcorn popper 2. Conveyor 3. Cooling tumbler 4. Masala Seasoning machine 5. Online dryer with vibro dryer 6. Slurry kettle 7. Caramelizer 8. Z conveyor 9. Pouch packaging Machine 10. Other machines & equipments( Air compressor, weighing scale) These Machines are used to produce popcorn from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, extruding & packaging completes in a very short span. The price of all machines will be Rs 15 Lac (Approx.) excluding transportation and set-up cost.

Raw material requirement: The major consumables require are Corn Kernels, oil, salt &spices etc. Average raw material (cost per Kg: Rs 90-140) d Manufacturing Process: The product is produced by heating kernels until the internal moisture expands and pops through the outer shell of the kernel, allowing the starch within to expand and cool. The machine will do everything to produce crispy popcorns. Finally, you will need to pack the product with the moisture proof packaging materials. Generally, corrugated outer cartons are used for the transportation and bulk handling of the items. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1200Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 3 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

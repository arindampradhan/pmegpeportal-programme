2 PROJECT REPORT ON FEATHER SHUTTLE COCK INTRODUCTION Badminton is played almost throughout the world by both men and women and also by the Children. This game is also very popular in our country and is being patronized by the Government and Non-Government agencies and clubs etc. With the increase in popularity of the badminton, the demand for good quality shuttle cocks is also increasing. The life of each shuttle cock is generally short after it is used in the game. Hence, the consumption pattern is quite frequent. The shuttle cock is one of the simplest items of sports goods manufacture with lesser investment of capital and can be produced in tiny and small-scale sector. MARKET POTENTIAL There exists a very good market potential for shuttle cock in the country and abroad. However, most of the shuttle cocks manufactured are used internally with the exports being very negligible due to poor quality and high per unit cost of production compared to the international standards. There exists a huge demand for shuttle cocks in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, MP, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, North-Eastern States and also in other States. The demand for the shuttle cocks in West Bengal is also quite good during the winter season. Besides Jaduberia, Midnapore (West Bengal), the other major concentration of the shuttle cock manufacturing units are in the Northern part of India specially in Jalandhar, Meerut and Delhi. Some units in Kolkata are also manufacturing this item. The shuttle cocks with the duck feathers are in greater demand than that of the hen feathers.

3 BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS This project profile is prepared on the basis of the following presumptions :- 1. Working Hours 8 hours per day 2. No. of shifts 1 shift per day 3. No. of working 25 days days per month 4. Total working 300 days days 5. Total working 2400 hours hours per year 6. Working 60% efficiency with 10% increase PA 7. Labour charge As per the rates existing in the locality 8. Margin Money 25% of capital investment 9. Rate of interest 10% on Capital 10. All the rates and estimates have been provided on the basis of the prevailing market price. 11. It is envisaged that very good quality shuttle cocks of high standard would be produced 12. Payback period 5 year (approx.) TECHNICAL A SPECTS Process of Manufacture The process of manufacture of the shuttle cock is very simple. The white duck feathers are generally used for the production of the shuttle cock. Sometimes hen feathers are also used for the cheaper variety of shuttle cocks. The feathers are first of all sorted out for selection of good variety of feathers. Then the feathers are washed with detergent for 30 to 60 minutes. Then, they are treated with the ultramarine blue like robin blue or Ujala for giving the brightening effect. The washed feathers are then properly dried and cut to 3” size with the help of the scissors. The feathers are then rounded off and pruned at the top. Then good quality cork bottom are taken. Altogether 16 nos. of bores are made on the flat surface of the wood cork with the help of cork boring machine. The feathers are then inserted into such bore and fixed with glue. Then 16 feathers thus inserted into the cork are knought with the Cotton thread. Gelatine is then smeared round over the knoughted thread. Then silk or cotton ribbon is attached at the Junction of the cork and feathers at the base of the shuttle cock. A brand sticker is also put round the cork and attached with the glue at base middle of the cork of the shuttle cock. Finally, the shuttle cocks are weighed on a balance and the weight is adjusted with the help of the small steel pins. The shuttle cocks used for indoor games should have a weight range of 70 or 72 or 74 grains and those for the outdoor games 82 or 84 or 86 grains. The shuttle cocks are then packed into the cylindrical card boxes fitted with the card board or metal lids with ten shuttle cocks in each box generally called in the trade as one roll. The shuttle cocks are then despatched for marketing.

4 QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS The BIS has recommended standard for manufacturing the shuttle cock. It is quite desirable that one should study this standard specification before venturing into this project. Besides the BIS specification, the customers also lay down their own quality standards regarding the quality of feathers, cork, adhesives etc. and the quality standard of the ultimate product. PRODUCTION CAPACITY Production Volume (Per Annum): 12000 Rolls (Each roll contains ten pieces of shuttle cocks). MOTIVE POWER 2 HP. POLLUTION CONTROL There is no pollution hazard from this type of industry either in air or in water. Hence, there is no need of taking any pollution control measures. ENERGY CONSERVATION The scope for energy conservation in the shuttle cock manufacturing industry is very little, since most of the operations are carried out manually except few operations like boring etc. However, the workers and staff members should be trained properly to make optimum use of power like fuel, electricity etc. to save energy. LABOUR REQUIREMENT: 7-8Manpower is required for shuttle cock masnufacturing Includes: 4skilled Labour 4 Unskilled Labour IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: It is estimated that from conception of the project to commercial production it may take about six months including purchase of machines, installation, staff recruitment, all clearance from different agencies such as DIC and financial institutions etc.

The fabric purchased in roll form is spread in layers on the cutting table. Patterns of various parts of the garmentmade out of card board or plywood or metal are laid on the fabric in such a way that wastage of fabric is minimized. Several layers of fabric are then cut through vertical motorized blade. Garments are stitched in assembly line manner wherein each machine operator completes only a part of the product. The stitching starts on the 1st machine and gets completed at the last stage where the product is inspected for quality defects if any. Labels of the schools or organization are stitched in the end. Some schools or organizations want their logo to be embroidered on the garment. The products are finally cleaned of loose yarn or dirt and packed in plastic bags as per customer requirements.

TOILET PAPER ROLL Introduction Toilet paper, sometimes called toilet tissue in Britain, is a tissue paper product primarily used to clean the anus and surrounding area of faecal material after defecation and to clean. It also acts as a layer of protection for the hands during these processes. It is usually supplied as a long strip of perforated paper wrapped around a paperboard core for storage in a dispenser near a toilet. Most modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in septic tanks, whereas some other bathroom and facial tissues are not. Toilet paper comes in various numbers of plies (layers of thickness), from one- to six-ply, with more back- to-back plies providing greater strength and absorbency. The use of paper for hygiene has been recorded in China in the 6th century AD, with specifically manufactured toilet paper being mass- produced in the 14th century.[2] Modern commercial toilet paper originated in the 19th century, with a patent for roll-based dispensers being made in 1883. Description of Toilet Paper Roll Machine Machinery for Toilet Paper Roll includes the following:  Main Machinery (Automatic/ Normal) Toilet paper Machines are used to produce total paper in bulk quantities. With the help of this machine the work of feeding,

shredding, threading and giving it finish completes in a very short span. This machine is mostly used in the paper making industries to make different types of paper roll etc. These Automatic toilet Paper roll Machines are very much helpful in folding the jumbo roll either into the shape or square or rectangular as per the need. Its speed is outstanding and totally controlled by the Control device. Besides, because of the cutting-edge technology, it also counts the number of roll it produces at a time. An extra remote for handling the device is attached in the machine, so, one can control its speed while operating the machine. Toilet Paper Roll Market Analysis By 2025, it is anticipated that India has almost one-third of the world market for tissue paper machines. During the forecast period, there will be only a small change in the market share of the region. India was the world's largest global woven paper packaging market in 2018. It is also expected to participate very much in the line of kitchen roll, toilet paper roll packaging. In addition, the market will have favourable prospects in this country. The average sale price of machinery in India is very low and the penetration rate of low capacity packaging machines is high. Therefore, Korea offers an environment to help expand the market. It is likely that India will enjoy a strong implementation in the world market of tissue paper packaging machines.

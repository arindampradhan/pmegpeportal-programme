GEAR BLANKS MANUFACTURING Introduction: Gear Blanks are produced by forging process of metal forming in which hot metal at particular temperature, where the metal having the plastic state, is pressed in die. Forging can be carried out either in open or closed die. Dies are prepared by special steels like hot work tool steels and suitably heat treated to have proper hardness and toughness so that the dies can be capable of pressing hot metal without any deformation in the die during forging. The properties of forged Gear Blanks are considered to be better properties than any other metal forming process. Machined Forged Gear Blanks are used in Automobile sector for Two-Wheeler and Three Wheeler. Market and Demand Aspects: Machined Forged Gear Blanks are consumed by various Automobile Industries of Two & Three Wheeler Sector At present Automobile Industry growth is very fast in the country. The major consumers of the Gear Blanks are Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Tempo, Hero Honda, Kinetic Honda, TVS, Yamaha, Honda, etc. So the future prospects of the Unit are very bright and even the Unit can think for spares market.

Raw materials: The main raw materials are steel rods, Die steel, fuels, etc which are locally available. Medium Carbon Steel of EN8, EN16R, etc are recommended grades. Manufacturing Process: Medium Carbon Steel Rods will be cut to the required length. Then cut blanks will be heated in Furnace to a temperature of 1350- 1450° C. After attaining the required temperature, heated blanks are removed one by one from the furnace and pressed in the dies for forging operation. Forged Gear Blanks have to be trimmed and pierced for removal of excess material for getting finished products. The forged gear blanks have to be sent for heat treatment of normalising to impart the refine grain structure and requisite properties as specified by the customer. Machinery requirements: Major machines and equipments that are required are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Power Hammer, Capacity of 1 MT 1 1000000 1000000 with 25 HP Motor along with other accessories Solid Frame type Trimming Press 1 300000 300000 of 60T Capacity Oil fired Heating Furnace with 1 300000 300000 blower of 3 HP Motor and other accessories Oil fired Normalising Furnace with 1 200000 200000 2 HP Motor Shot Blasting Machine with5 HP 1 250000 250000 Motor of 100 Kg. capacity Power Hacksaw Machine with 1 3 50000 150000 HP Motor Centre lathe heavy duty Machine 1 250000 250000

with Motor and accessories of 10’ length Other machines & equipments Ls 250000 Total Amount 2700000 Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 50 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

FENUGREEK POWDER MAKING UNIT Introduction: Fenugreek is an annual plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It's a semi-arid plant with little rounded leaves and yellow cubic seeds. The seedling is grown worldwide. It is native to the Mediterranean and widely grown in Europe and Asia, with India being Fenugreek's largest producer. Fenugreek seeds have a taste similar to maple, which is sweet and nutty and which is used to cover up medicine taste. One of the most important species of human food is fenugreek. It gives the human body natural food fibre and other essential nutrient items. Its leaves and seeds are used in Ayurvedic medicine as well as in food. Fenugreek, an aromatic and flavourful spice, is widely used in both edible and medicinal applications. Fenugreek has a deep spicy and sweet taste that is similar to that of seasoning. “Kasuri- Methi” is well-known for its wonderful aroma and is also used in culinary preparations. Fenugreek powder is used in the preparation of pickles and vegetable dishes, among other things. Fenugreek seeds are available in both whole and powdered forms. Roasting them reduces the bitterness while still enhancing the taste. The chemical substance responsible for the plant's distinct odor is the solution, which is found in the seeds.

PPRROOJJEECCTT RREEPPOORRTT OONN JJAACCKKFFRRUUIITT PPRROOCCEESSSSIINNGG INTRODUCTION Jackfruit is one of the most significant tropical fruit produced in India. Jack grows well and gives good yield in warm humid climate of hill slopes and hot humid climate of plains. Jackfruit is also known as the poor man's food in the Eastern and Southern part of India. India is considered as the motherland of jackfruit. In India, it has wide distribution in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, the foothills of the Himalayas and South Indian States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The tender fruits of the tree are used as vegetables and the ripe ones as table fruits. The traditional varieties bear fruits once in a year. Usually, the flowering starts from mid-November and extends till mid- February, depending on the location and the variety. The tender fruits come to market from March onwards and continue

till August. The fruits begin to ripe in the month of June. The region comprising Assam and Tripura produces major share of jackfruit in India and the total annual production in Assam is estimated to be in the vicinity of 1,75,000 tons. However, the fruit is perishable and cannot be stored for long time because of its inherent compositional and textural characteristics. In every year, a considerable amount of jackfruit, specially obtained in the glut season (June- July) goes waste (30 to 34 %) due to lack of proper post-harvest knowledge during harvesting, transporting and storing. Processing is important technique for the preservation of jackfruit. It adds diversified and attractive food items in dietary menu as well as contributes to income generation and employment. This project profile is for setting up of a Jackfruit Processing unit based on 200 working days per annum and 8 working hours per day. The installed production capacity of the unit per annum is as follows; Jackfruit Chips - 20 Ton Jackfruit Pickles - 10 Ton Jackfruit Jam - 10 Ton Dehydrated Jackfruit - 5 Ton MARKET POTENTIAL Jackfruit is the favourite fruit for many, owing to its sweetness in taste. Jackfruit is also rich in several nutrients. It can act as source of complete nutrition to the consumers. The fruit is equivalent to Avocado and olive in terms of the healthier mix of nutrients for human dietary needs, almost having the exact nutrient equivalents of mother’s milk. It is rich in vitamin B and C, potassium, calcium, iron, proteins and high level of carbohydrates, affordable and readily available supplement to our staple food. It is heavy and bulky fruit and hence transportation is not very easy and is costly as well. Therefore, its down the stream products with longer shelf-life can be easily transported and shall also have value-addition.

PROCESS DETAILS Jackfruit is heavy as well as bulky and actual recovery of bulbs or edible portion varies from 20% to 25%. Jack fruit is a highly fibrous fruit. It has a thick wasted skin enclosing seeded fruit pods to which also adhere lots of fibrous tissue. After cutting the fruit in several pieces, the bulbs are removed manually. As the fruit contains highly sticky latex, small quantity of edible oil is applied on hands and then seeds are removed from bulbs. Process for Jackfruit Chips: Fully matured unripe jackfruit is the basic raw material for fried jack chips. The edible bulbs from the Jackfruit are extracted by manual cutting. The fruits are cut along their equatorial axis with the help of a sharp stainless steel knife smeared with edible oil. The bulbs are then carefully separated from the rind and placenta. Care should be taken to handle the bulbs with minimum damage. The freshly extracted whole bulbs are deseeded and sliced as per the required size by using Jackfruit chips cutting machine to obtain finger chips of size approximately 15×40 mm. The bulb slices are taken for physical and biochemical analysis whenever required. The cut bulb slices are blanched in hot water of 90 Degree C, containing 0.1% of KMS for 5 minutes followed by draining at room temperature for 15 min. A drained bulb slices (250 gm) are deep fat fried using cooking grade sunflower oil. The Slice: Oil Ratio is maintained constant at 1:4 for all frying trails at three different temperatures like 160, 180 and 200°C for three different frying time periods 6, 7, 8 min. The mixture of salt and dry chili powder at the ratio of 2:1 @ 8 gm/100 gm is added to the fried chips. They are packed in polythene bags and sealed with sealing machine. Process for Jackfruit Pickle: For preparing pickle, unripe jackfruits are used. Apply oil to a knife and peel the jackfruit. Peel the skin. Cut the peeled fruits into 12- 18 mm thick slices. Prepare a 5% common salt solution by mixing salt with water, 50 g salt/l. Place the slices in a container and cover with brine solution. Weigh them down to keep them submerged in the brine. Drain the slices after 24 hours using a stainless steel sieve and wash them to remove the excess salt. Grind and mix the following spices (for 1 kg peeled jackfruit): 2.5 g turmeric powder, 25 g coriander seeds, 10-20 g chili powder, 10 g salt. 150g sugar. Add the spice mix and vinegar

(10 ml/kg) to the jackfruit slices and cook the mix.in a stainless steel boiling pan for 30 minutes while stirring. Pour the pickle into pre-sterilized jars and seal. Cool the jars at room temperature, then label. Process for Jackfruit Jam: Ripe fruits are cut into several pieces and the bulbs are removed by hand. The bulbs are then cooked for 15 minutes and pulped, the core being removed. Cut the end of the bulb to remove the seeds, and grind the bulbs to pulp using a blender. Dissolve 10 gm pectin per kg mixed fruit pulp in some water and add to the mixture. Add 1 kg sugar per kg mixed fruit pulp and mix. Heat the mixture in a stainless steel vessel while stirring continuously until the total sugar content is 68-70º C, pour into pre-sterilised jam jars and seal. The ideal pouring temperature is 82-85º C. Cool jars at room temperature, then labelling is carried out. The colour of the final product is yellow, TSS is 68° Brix, the consistency is semi solid and the flavour is pleasant. But the product is somewhat sticky, so further refinement of the process is needed to develop a marketable product. Process for Dehydrated Jackfruit: Cut fruit in half lengthwise, Carve out the core of the fruit, Scoop out the bulbs, Cut the end of the bulbs to remove the seeds, Cut the deseeded bulb into 2 or 4 pieces, Blanch the fruit segments by plunging into boiling water for 2 minutes and cool them rapidly under clean cold water. Place the blanched segments in a single layer on mesh dryer trays. Put them close together but not touching to achieve the maximum capacity and an even rate of drying. Load trays into the drying cabinet and dry at 55º C for 6-7 hours until the moisture content is reduced to 5%. Remove trays and pack dried fruits immediately in moisture proof containers e.g. 400 gauge polythene or polypropylene pouches, and heat-seal them.

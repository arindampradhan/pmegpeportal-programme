PLASTIC PRICE TAG MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A Plastic Price Tag is a label declaring the price of an item for sale. Price tags plays an important role when shopping in store. They inform the customer about the price of an item in such a way that it does not raise any doubts for the customer. Price tags contain a number of items about the product, such as: product name, name of the producer, weight or capacity, barcode/EAN, and finally, information about whether a given product is on the shelf at a regular or promotional price. Plastic tags are used to provide information about the status of a product, safety, and for equipment inspection. Plastic tags are lightweight and have desirable resistance properties, thus increasing the shelf life of a label. Plastic tags are tamper-proof and durable. These properties are increasing the preference for plastic tags in various industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and automotive. Plastic tags are found to be more useful in differentiating products and manufacturing processes when labeled through different shapes, sizes, and color tags.

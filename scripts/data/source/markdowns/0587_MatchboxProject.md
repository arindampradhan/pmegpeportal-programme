MATCH BOX PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: A matchbox is a box made of cardboard or thin wood and designed to hold matches. It usually has a coarse striking surface on one edge for lighting the matches contained inside. A safety match can only light when someone strikes it against the striking surface on the side of the match box. A “striking surface” is made of sand, powdered glass and a chemical called “red phosphorous”. A simple match box is cuboid in shape. USES & MARKET POTENTIAL: Matchsticks are a very handy tool used in starting a fire. They are used in the kitchen to light gas and kerosene. Other application involves starting a fireplace, industrial burners, camp fire or to light candles. Matchsticks are made from wood or cardboard strips. Matchsticks are used to start fire under controlled conditions, They are also used in industry for starting fire when heat energy is needed and for burning waste materials. India makes four crore matchboxes per day and these are the cheapest in the world. Every third matchbox used in the world is Indian. The industry produces 90 million bundles a year; each bundle has 600 matchboxes and each box has between 40 and 50 sticks. As matchsticks are fast moving consumer goods, they demand branding activity to get the market share. Matchsticks are sold in volume. The success of this business depends on the strong channel network.

MACHINERY REQUIREMENT: Basic Machineries requirement are as follows: 1. Chain Saw A chainsaw (alternatively spelled chain saw) is a portable, mechanical saw which cuts with a set of teeth attached to a rotating chain that runs along a guide bar. It is used in activities such as tree felling, lumbering, bucking, pruning, cutting firebreaks in wild land and harvesting of firewood. 2. Log Debarker It’s a machine which is used to remove bark from the tree logs utilizing appropriate cutters and mechanism.

3. Veneer Peeling Machine It's a machine designed to peel the debarked log into an appropriate thickness veneer sheet. 4. Veneer Chopping Machine It’s used to slice the given veneer sheet into items of required dimensions. 5. Rotating Drum Dryer The rotary drum dryer is a hot air type of dryer, which dries objects in between 90 to 95 % dry solids. The material is gently dried as it cascades through the hot air flow.

12. Counting and Packaging Machine This machine counts the small unit load and packs it into single large unit after fixed count set by its controller. RAW MATERIAL: Basic raw material are as follows: 1. Wood 2. Cardboard 3. Chemicals & other consumables (like Red phosphorous) 4. Paper and Packing Material MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Process is mentioned below: 1. Matchstick Manufacturing: Lumber is cut into suitable lengths by a chain saw. After the peeling of the bark, the log is peeled into veneer- like thin long shavings by the peeling machine. Then the veneer is split and chopped to the designated stick size by the chopping machine. Then the sticks are soaked in a dilute solution of ammonium phosphate and dried. The matches are then dumped into feed hopper, which lines them up. A perforated belt holds them upside down while they are dipped in a series of three tanks. The matches are dried for 50-60 minutes before they are packed.

2. Matchbox Manufacturing: In this step match boxes are manufactured to contain match sticks. Printed sheets for outer boxes delivered from printing houses are cut, folded and glued by the paper box making machine so as to obtain match box containers and covers. 3. Filling: The match sticks are filled into the match box by the automatic filling machine 4. Finishing Process: In this process, the chemical coating machine applies chemical to the match boxes, which have been filled with match sticks by the box filling machine as they come to trays. 5. Packaging: In this process the match boxes are counted and packed in larger unit packaging by a counting and packaging machine, which are further packed in cardboard and sent for sale.

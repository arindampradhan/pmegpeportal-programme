ANTI‐CORROSIVE PAINTS Introduction: Corrosion is a natural phenomenon. Due to various types of pollution, corroding factors are on the increase. Hence corrosion prevention is of prime importance in day-to-day activities. One of the natural products with versatile utility in prevention of corrosion in CNSL (Cashew Nut Shell Liquid). This oil is available in plenty from cashew industry as a by-product. CNSL is treated and polymerized to give resins which will act as good coating materials. These resins are used in anti-corrosive protective coatings. The most important use is in painting marine vessels and finishing boats. These paints are used in chemical plants for protecting the machinery from corrosion. It is also used in structural application, where more exposure to heat and sun-light is there. Uses & Market Potential: Anti corrosive paints are used for preservation of structural steel work against acid fumes and adverse weather conditions. It protects the metal components against degradation due to moisture, salt spray, oxidation or exposure to various weather conditions and industrial chemicals.

There is good market potential for these type of primers in the country; more so in the coastal states where finishing boats and vessels are in plenty. As Chemical industry is expanding rapidly, the concept of giving protection to chemical plants is also on the increase. As more and more stress is laid on preventive maintenance, increasing use of anti-corrosive paints is anticipated. Machinery & Equipments : Basic machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Mild steel ball mill-500 Ltrs.cap. with 10 HP 1 700000 motor 2. Planetary mixer 200 Ltrs with 5 HP motor 1 500000 3. Triple roll mill . 6" × 12" 1 400000 4. Paint storage tank 1000 ltrs. 1 50000 5. Solvent storage tank with pump 1 300000 6. M.

Manufacturing Process: The paint manufacture consists of the following basic procedures:  Mixing the pigment with sufficient vehicle (Resin Solution) to make paste which has the correct consistency for grinding.  Grinding the paste in a mill until the aggregates are broken down as indicated by the 'fineness of grind' test.  Letting down the ground paste with the remainder materials in the formula.  Tinting the batch to the required colour.  Testing to determine physical properties and performance requirements.  Straining, filling and packing. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

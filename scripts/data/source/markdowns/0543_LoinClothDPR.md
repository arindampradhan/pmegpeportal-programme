LOIN - CLOTH/GAMCHA MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: The textile sector is one of the largest employers in the country and within this sector; handloom weaving enjoys a pre-eminent status. Even prior to Independence, the father of the nation promoted it as a gainful economic activity. The rationale was simple- it required little investment, provided individuals with gainful employment and was seen as a means of ensuring self-sufficiency and the survival of the country’s traditional crafts and artistry. India has a rich tradition of handloom weaving since time immemorial with the earliest evidences going back to the Indus Valley civilization. Export of handloom products, as early as the fifteenth century was reported, followed by Vasco da Gama’s visit to India thereby opening of trade routes for Europe. Indian handloom sector is ancient and has served the economy well in terms of employment. The sector is very important from the point of view of its size and employment potential. The relevance of the handloom sector in the agrarian economy is massive because of its linkages with crucial and sensitive sectors like agriculture. It uses agricultural products as raw materials and, therefore, provides an ever-ready market for agricultural produce. Therefore, in an economy where majority of people still rely on agrarian sector for their livelihood, the significance of handloom is well understood.

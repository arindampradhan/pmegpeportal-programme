1. INTRODUCTION Often found near roads, landfills, or in cultivated fields as a weed, German Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) is one of the world’s most important medicinal herbs. It is native to southern and eastern Europe, and also grown in Germany, Hungary, France, Russia, Croatia and Argentina. Often referred to as the ‘star’ of medicinal herbs, Chamomile flowers are white and yellow with a gentle taste and a scent similar to apples or honey. Its seeds require open soil to survive and the plant prefers sandy soil and full sun. Chamomile is an important source of income in Croatia, where UEBT member Jan-Spider works with 40 cooperatives. These families make a good part of their living from cultivation of Chamomile. For some of the families who have larger areas under cultivation, Chamomile can provide 50-80% of their income, while for others it might provide 20-30%. Most families in the region also grow other herbs and vegetables. Farming families have long utilised chamomile. Chamomile is well-known among the locals for its usage as an infusion for intestinal pain, colds, and improved sleep. Chamomile is harvested using special flower harvesters that resemble large combs with knives. Jan-Spider processes the Chamomile from whole flowers or slices it for tea filter bags once it is harvested. These Chamomile infusion products are mostly sold to the food industry for use in herbal teas, but they are also sold to cosmetics and pharmaceutical firms. Chamomile tea is an herbal beverage created by steeping dried chamomile flowers in water. It can be served hot or cold. It's caffeine-free by nature. Chamomile is a daisy-like flowering plant with white petals and a mustard-yellow core. There are a number of different forms of chamomile, but only two are utilised in tea: German chamomile

and Roman chamomile. Chamomile tea, one of the most popular herbal teas, has been used for medical purposes since ancient Egypt. The more intact the chamomile flowers, the higher the quality, so go for loose tea. If you open up chamomile tea in tea bags, you’ll find crushed tiny bits of chamomile flowers which makes a lower quality tea. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Chamomile tea is a popular caffeine-free drink made from dried chamomile flowers. See how to make chamomile tea properly, step-by-step, from a certified Tea Sommelier. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Chamomile is a daisy relative and a member of the Asteraceae family; the joyful tiny yellow and white flowers have a striking resemblance to daisies. While most herbs are collected for their stems, leaves, or even roots, chamomile is taken for its blooms only. It's preferable to harvest it while the blossoms are fully open, before the petals begin to drop backwards. Harvesting- Chamomile picking is a simple and soothing activity. Pinch the plant's stem immediately below the bloom head gently. Then, between the flower head and the other pinched fingers, place your forefinger and middle finger under the flower head and pop the flower head off. Withering- Good qualities are spread out on laths wrapped with jute, wire, or nylon netting and let to wither in the sun. For the withering process, normal quality is spread out over big sieves. Huge ventilators force air through the leaf layers from below. During the withering process, the humidity of the still thick, unmalleable flowers is lowered by 30%. Cleaning- Remove all of the flower heads that are in full bloom and leave behind any that are just budding. Drying- Allow the flowers to dry in a dark, warm, and dry environment for 1-2 weeks in a single layer on paper towels or cheese cloth. You may also use a dehydrator on the lowest setting to dry them. Packaging- When the flowers are dry and cool, store them in a sealed glass jar for up to 6 months. They can still be used after 6 months, but the flavor is less intense. It can also be packaged by putting the dried flowers in small pouches used as tea bags.

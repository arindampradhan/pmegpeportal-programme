Lemongrass Oil Introduction Lemongrass oil has a strong lemon-like odour due to high citral content (75-90%). The minimum commercial requirement is 70% citral content. The major quality checking measures are its citral content and its solubility in alcohol. This is an essential ingredient in toiletry products such as toilet soaps, bath salts, etc. It is also employed in artificial lemon flavouring and in the manufacture of ionenes. Ionenes are very important for the production of artificial flavour, perfumes, and soaps and as raw material for vitamin A manufacturing. Here in this article, we intend to explore how to start a small scale lemongrass oil manufacturing business. The oil is of a reddish-yellow to reddish-brown colour, with a strong, lemon odour. It is also used in pharmaceutical preparations, such as pain balm, disinfectants, and mosquito repellent cream. Formulation of the Scheme: The scheme is formulated for individual entrepreneur or a group of individuals or company having own or lease land and able to handle the agro-based enterprise. SHG members in cluster may also take such type of scheme. Objectives:  To popularize non-traditional cash crop to improve socio-economic status of farmers.

 To acquire loan by able enterprising farmers for cultivation and processing of Lemongrass for oil. Area of operation In flood free upland situations up-to 1000 m altitude. About the crop Lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus), Family: Poaceae Variety Krishna and CKP-25 Economic parts Fresh herbs. End product Lemongrass oil at farming level. Uses Oil is the source of Citral which is used as a basic raw material for synthesis of Beta-ionone used for synthesis of a number of useful aromatic compounds and Vitamin-A. This is thus used as substitutes of ‘cod liver oil. Citral itself is used in perfumery for various grades of soaps, detergents, cosmetics and flavour agent for soft drinks. Soil Well drained deep loam to sandy loam and loamy soil, rich in organic matter, upland situations and irrespective of surface topography Climate Warm and humid climate, upto 1000m altitude from MSL receiving well distributed medium to heavy rainfall. Propagation Vegetative means by separation of slips.1-2 slips per hill. Land preparation Medium range of land preparation or as zero tillage crops in slopes Gestation period 5 months Crop cycle 4 years Cropping option As irrigated and rainfed crops.

Planting time April – October Spacing Normal planting distance is 45 cm x 45 cm. Plant population 50000 slips per ha. Planting method Planting is done in row to row method in triangular fashion highly desirable in slope land. Manures: Mix well 1.5- 2.0 ton FYM / compost per acre during land preparation followed by mulching of agricultural wastes. Organic practice gives better results. Irrigation Light irrigation just after planting is beneficial if planted in dry days. Harvesting Ground level harvesting is ideal. About 4 -5 harvests in a year and 15 times harvesting in 4 years. Production: Fresh herbs 80 MT per hectare per year. Oil extraction: steam distillation process and food grade stainless steel unit is used. Oil recovery: Commercial oil recovery is 0.6%. Oil production: Average 480 kg oil per ha per year. Oil Price Presently at 900/-per kg Economic size of farm 20 acres = 8 ha = 60 bighas Model scheme for lemongrass cultivation and oil extraction Economic size of farm: 20 acres = 8 ha = 60 bighas Raw Materials The major raw material is lemon grass. And the grass plants grow well in soils not suitable for richer production plants. From sandy and rather dry soils yield relatively more oil and oil of higher citral content than plants from very fertile soils.

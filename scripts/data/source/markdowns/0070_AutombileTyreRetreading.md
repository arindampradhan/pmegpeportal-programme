AUTOMOBILE TYRE RETREADING Introduction: When the sole portion of a tyre wears out, a new sole can be applied on it or the whole tyre up to tread can be renewed. This retreated tyre can be used again and almost are equivalent to new tyres and work quite satisfactorily for reasonable periods. A retreated tyre is expected to give about 3/4 of mileage or even more as that of a new one. With the advancement of science & technology and the ever increasing demand for vehicular traffic due to ever increase in trade & commerce, playing of more trucks, busses, cars & Jeeps etc. is a must and consequently these speak for better prospects of tyre retreading services. Retreading of damaged tyre is done by conventional hot matrix curing in most cases. But recently a new technology has been developed called “Precured Tread Rubber Retreading Process” which is commonly known as “Cold Process Retreading”. In this process, the Precured Tread Rubber already has a tread pattern on it eliminating the need for a tread matrix at vulcanizing stage. Tread Rubber is precured along with other raw materials and manufactured in the factory under controlled conditions and given a well researched pattern ensuring that the transporter gets a reliable perfectly finish product. Retreading Tyre by precured method gives 50% more mileage than the tyre retreaded by conventional process. This report contains details of retreading Car Tyres.

Product & its Application: Tread assumes importance in either technology, hot or cold. It is that portion of the tyre, which is in contact with the road surface. It comprises of 20-25 per cent of the whole tyre body. The tyre body commands 75 to 80 per cent of the manufacturing cost of a tyre. Applying a new tread on the body of a worn tyre, gives it a fresh life. This fresh life, estimate industry experts, comes at half the price of a new tyre. An important criteria for retreading is however the quality of the fabric. If the core fabric of the tread is too damaged or already over used, retreading may not be possible. There are thus technological limitations too. However, if the core fabric is in a good condition, the tyre is identified for potential retreading. Retreading is done either through a conventional method or a pre-cure method. The conventional method is sometimes referred to as the mould cure or hot cure process. An un-vulcanized rubber strip, after going through the process of vulcanization adapts to the mould, is applied to the buffed casing of the tyre. However, modern day processes have adapted to a pre-cure method. This modern method, also referred to as cold cure, has the strip already pressed while it is applied to the casing. The strip is stuck to the casing by a layer of compounded un-cured rubber also known as cushion or bonding gum. The un-cured rubber is vulcanized by applying heat and pressure. As of current, the patterns of retreading in India are 50 per cent pre- cured and 50 per cent conventional. Modern processing technology has enabled the process to run smoothly and seamlessly. Market Potential: As day by day, more and more vehicles are running on roads, hence more tyres are required for replacement. With further growth of economy, there will be an increase in transport as well as passenger vehicles and hence more tyres will be required. Hence, there is a very wide scope for retread tyres as an original replacement. Retreading of tyres in the commercial vehicle segment is poised for growth. The biggest driver for growth will be the rising use of radial truck and bus tyres. The other drivers will include the rise in multi-axle trucks, road infrastructure and highway connectivity. It is the operational savings that have led to the rise in popularity of tyre retreading in India. In the commercial vehicle segment especially. No section in the commercial vehicle industry is immune to

retreading. May it be a 49-tonne tractor-trailer or a 1-tonne mini truck. Retreading of tyres is catching up. A retreaded tyre costs around 30 per cent less than a new tyre. At the other end, a retreaded tyre performs up to 80 per cent of a new tyre under similar operating conditions. It is the value for money a retreaded tyre offers, which has made it a favorite of a transporter. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Precured Tread Rubber 2. Cushion Compound 3.

Manufacturing Process: The manufacturing of retreading rubber is done in the following stages:  Compounding: Removing unwanted materials such as nails, rivets etc.  Mixing: Reclaimed rubber and oils;  Extruding: The mixture of rubber so obtained is put into extruder to form rubber sheets.  Retreading: Before retreading tyre is buffed and it is allowed to stick properly. Tyres are buffed properly to remove all undesired rubber and to clean surface. The retreading rubber is now put on its outer surface with an adhesive solution. The tyre coming from the customers is cleaned dully. Dust and mud are removed. The casing is inspected for cuts, ply section, condition of beads etc., and based on the condition of the casing; the tyre is selected or rejected. Under inflated conditions the selected tyre's crown area is buffed to the required texture and contour. This is for better bonding of procured rubber to the casing. The buffed casing is mounted on the tread building machine. Cushion compound is applied on the buffed tread area over which the procured tread rubber is applied and stickled using rollers. The joint portion of the procured tread rubber is stepped to avoid possible opening during curing of the tyre. The buildup of the tyre is covered by a rubber envelope and placed in the “bonder” and the bonder steam is passed at specific temperature, which cures the cushion compound to complete the bonding of the tread on the casing. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft.

Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Machine Operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

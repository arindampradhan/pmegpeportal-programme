BODYWASH GEL Introduction: Body Wash gel is a specialized liquid product used for cleaning the body during showers. Not to be confused with liquid soaps, in fact, do not contain saponified oil. Instead, it uses synthetic detergents derived from either petroleum or plant sources. Body washes gels have a lower p H value than the traditional soap, which is also known to feel less drying to the skin. In certain cases, sodium stearate is added to the chemical combination to create a solid version of the shower gel. Body Wash gels have a high liquid consistency. Designed to foam when applied to the skin, many also contain foaming agents such as Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) and Sodium Coco Sulphate (SCS). Both these ingredients produce lather when they are applied to the skin and come into contact with water, but have very different molecular structures so can affect the skin in different ways. Unlike slippery soap bars, shower gels have a liquid format that many find more convenient to wash with. Their quick-foaming formulations are also highly effective at cleaning the body, without stripping the skin of its protective barrier. Uses & Market Potential: Body Wash gels offer features like freshness, moisture-free skin and no dryness. In addition, the urban consumer spending on health and skin care products bolsters the market growth in the forecast period. The market opportunities for new entrants are lucrative and hold a lot of potential in terms of customer service and revenue generation. The global body wash gel market is anticipated to grow at a

positive CAGR of 3.6% by 2023. The shower gel market is driven by increase in use of shower gels in malls and supermarkets as compared to demand for conventional soap bars. A shower gel has a strong scent and smells like a perfume. Shower gels are becoming a better alternative to traditional bar soaps. Consumers are finding that traditional soaps make the skin dry by stripping out the moisture, due to presence of sodium hydroxide. This has led to growth in demand for shower gels as they hydrate the skin due to presence of various oils and moisturizers. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Deionized water 2. Sodium Lauryl Sulphate 3. Cocamidopropyl Betaine 4. Disodium Cocamido 5. Propylene Glycol 6. Fragrance & other consumables 7.

Manufacturing Process: In personal care products manufacturing, formulation of raw material with fragrance plays an important role. The raw material for Body Wash gel is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the deionized water and Cocamidopropyl Betaine are mixed in required proportion in a tank. In the next step, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate and Disodium Cocamido are added into the tank in desired proportion. After this, the tank is heated to a temperature of 60℃ by using steam jacketed kettle. The SLS is a foaming agent to form foam with water. The jacketed kettle, resembles a double boiler with one container placed inside another, is heated when steam is circulated through the outer container. Inside the interior kettle are blades that revolve to mix the oils as they are heated. Agitators are also used for continuous stirring. After heating for 40-50 minutes the first group of ingredients has turned smooth. The steam is released from the outer container of the kettle, and the mixture is allowed to cool. After this, Propylene Glycol, Triclosan, DMDM hydantoin are added into the mixture in required proportion. Continuous stirring is done with the help of agglomerator. The microbial cosmetic ingredients Methylpropanediol and Phenoxyethanol are added into the mixture in desired proportion. After this, the mixture is poured into homogenizer to adjust p H. The desired fragrance is added into the mixture as per product requirement. After this, p H of the gel is tested. The p H of the body wash gel is adjusted by adding Ethyl Lauroyl in required proportion. The range of p H for body wash gel is kept between 7-8. The gel prepared in the previous step is check for desired specifications. After this, they are filled in the bottles using filling machine. After this, they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work will cost Rs 4 Lac (Approx.)

Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 10 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require.  NOC from State Pollution Control Board

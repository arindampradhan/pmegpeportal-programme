Whiteboards are simple to use and require no special skills. They, like their blackboard counterparts, are reusable and can be erased quickly and reused for quick explanations and spontaneous work. Whiteboards are great for explaining math problems, reading texts, matching exercises, ranking activities, discussion activities and other “unfolding processes.

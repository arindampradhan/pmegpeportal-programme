Coir must not be confused with coir pith, which is the powdery and spongy material resulting from the processing of the coir fibre. The coir fibre is relatively waterproof, and is one of the few natural fibres resistant to damage by salt water. Coir pots are biodegradable planting containers made from the fibrous husk of the coconut. Coir pot are soft, flexible pots are ideal for transplanting new plants as they can be placed directly in the ground. Coconut coir is an excellent growing medium for new plant. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES  Coir pots are biodegradable planting containers made from the fibrous husk of the coconut used for plantation of new plant.  Coir pot are used as an insert pot for the ceramic pot to increase its life.  Coir hanging pots can serve gardening needs in a better way compared to plastic or earthen pots.  Coir pot are used as a decorative item for holding some artificial flower plant.

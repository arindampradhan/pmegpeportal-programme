STEEL WATCH STRAP MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: There are many types of Watch Straps, made of Leather, Nylon, Stainless Steel and Brass etc. Watch straps are made in various designs including ornamental one, being used by the public now a days. In this Project Profile, it is intended to manufacture stainless steel watch straps out of stainless steel sheet scrap and wire. Since the scrap of required gauge is easily available from the manufacturers of stainless steel utensils, it is comparatively more profitable than manufacturing these items out of virgin stainless steel sheets or coil. Uses & Market Potential: The Watch Strap is an integral part of any watch. After all, it fastens the watch to your wrist. Without it’s invention, we’d still be carrying pocket watches around. Wrist watch has become necessity for the present day life of human beings. It is being used by people from all walks of life, male, female, educated, uneducated, young and old etc. Watch strap being an integral part of wrist watch, it has a good market for supply to meet original demand and in the replacement market. Apart from the large scale wrist watch manufacturers, such as Titan, HMT, Maxima, Allwyn, Timex etc., a good

number of small scale units in many States have also come up with their phased production programme for wrist watches. The demand for the production of the item is therefore likely to increase rapidly in near future. Further, due to durability of the product it is preferred over all other types of straps. Moreover, due to fast changes in the design and liking of people, there is good replacement prospects for the product as well. Therefore, there is a good and assured future for the product. Product: STEEL WATCH STRAP Raw Material: 1. Stainless Steel Sheet Scrap 2. Spring Bars and Link Bars 3. Packaging Material Manufacturing Process: Raw Material Component Surface Procurement Assembly Grinding Polishing Packaging Fig. 1 – Process Flowchart

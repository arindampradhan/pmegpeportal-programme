AMARANTHUS PROCESSING UNIT Introduction: Amaranthus is a genus (family Amaranthaceae) consisting of more than 50 species and is a pseudocereal that was domesticated in America over 4000 years ago by the Aztecs and Mayas. The importance of amaranth has resurged in the last years due to agricultural features, since it is a fast-growing cultivar with tolerance to drought conditions, can grow in poor soils, and has important nutritional properties. Moreover, it has minerals, such as calcium, sodium, iron, magnesium, and vitamin E. Polyphenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which have been characterized in amaranth grains, which makes it an excellent source of bioactive compounds. Typically, amaranth grain is not eaten raw and suffers a variety of processing methods in order to achieve desired flavor, color, texture, and, sometimes, nutritional and nutraceutical properties. The different processing methods considered in this chapter such as cooking in water, toasting, fermentation, germination, or extrusion affect the nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics that have beneficial effects on human health. The health benefits of amaranth come from nutrients and, in part, through the antioxidant characteristic of the phenolic compounds present in the grain, so that changes and variation in the composition and concentration of Nutrients and non-nutrient could indicate the type of amaranth grain processing that can preserve its nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics. Amaranth in Hindi is known as Rajgira. Simply put, Rajgira means raj (royal) & gira (grain). As a matter of fact, amaranth grain meaning in Gujarati is also Rajgira. Moreover, amaranth grain in India is also known as 'Ramdana', meaning God’s own grain.

Uses & Market Potential:  There are various ways to use amaranth as a part of the daily diet:  Boil whole amaranth grains can be used to make porridge.  Pop dried amaranth can be used as popcorn and it is eaten as a snack.  Popped amaranth can be also used as salads or in soups. Amaranth seed has a high protein content, which helps muscles heal faster after they've worked out. Recent developments, such as busy and urban lifestyles, the acceptance of on-the-go meals, and rising health consciousness among the working population, are expected to fuel demand for low-cost protein sustenance over the forecast period. Amaranth oil also has anti-inflammatory effects, which may help you avoid allergic reactions. Amaranth by-products are used in nutritional supplements, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food additives, among other fields. Over the forecast period, the increasing geriatric population, for which the substance is advantageous in a variety of medical conditions, is expected to drive up demand for amaranth in the pharmaceutical industry. The high concentration of proteins, enzymes, and phytosterols in amaranth seeds and leaves makes them one of the most sought-after grains on the market. Aside from the high protein content, amaranth seeds contain various peptides that are believed

to inhibit free radical activity and suppress inflammation. The global amaranth market size is anticipated to reach USD 13.89 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., progressing at a CAGR of 11.3% during the forecast period. Product: Amaranthus Seed Raw Material: Basic raw materials are harvested amaranthus seed and packing material Manufacturing Process:  Raw material procurement  Pre-Cleaning  De-Stoning  Magnetic Separation  Gravity Separation  Weighing & Packaging Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and polishing area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1200-1800Sqft.

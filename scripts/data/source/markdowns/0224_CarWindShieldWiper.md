1. INTRODUCTION A vehicle's wiper system is an integrated system for removing rain, snow, ice, and debris from the glass or windshield. It has a significant impact on visibility and the safety of passengers and the vehicle. It is a legal necessity in every automobile. It's in nearly every vehicle, including cars, trucks, railroad engines, and cabin-equipped boats. Pivot - left or right-hand drive, sequential sweep, single blade arm, mono blade, pantograph system, and twin windscreen wiper arms are some of the types of wipers used in automobiles. The functioning of almost all present wiper mechanisms is powered by an electric motor. Pneumatic drives are also utilized to drive wiper arms in some situations. COMPONENTS OF WINDSHIELD WIPER Windshield wiper system consists of several components which are as follows-  Wiper motor- It powers the wiper mechanism's connections, causing the wiper blade to travel over the windscreen. The motor is linked to the windshield wiper arm. The wiper arm begins to move back and forth when the motor is switched on. It drags the blade over the windshield as a result at a speed set by the switch.

 Wiper arm - The wiper arm acts as a connection between the blade and the motor. It is pivoted at one end (connects to the wiper motor) and the other end is connected to the wiper blade.  Linkage -Linkage has two primary purposes. Firstly, it keeps the wiper arm and blade in place and ensures optimum blade-to-windscreen contact. Second, it transforms the rotational motion generated by the motor into a usable format. It uses a worm gear to do this. Worm gear decreases the speed of the motor's output shaft and transforms it to the torque needed to operate the wiper arm.  Wiper blade - The blade is the portion of windshield wiper that cleans it. It's a rubber and plastic piece that attaches to the wiper arm. At all times, the rubber portion is in touch with the windshield. The backing is made of plastic, and it attaches to the wiper arm. On activating the windshield wiper system, wiper blades are dragged back and forth over the windshield by the wiper arms. The rubber portion cleans the windshield of moisture and dirt. This keeps the driver's vision intact. A decent rubber blade will wipe the water away from the windshield without leaving any streaks or marks. The wiper arm's design, which applies equal pressure across the length of the rubber blades through the wiper arm, is also responsible for the streak-free functioning.  Windshield washer pump – the windshield cleaning system contains two major components i.e. windshield washer fluid reservoir and windshield washer pump. The washer fluid is kept in the reservoir. When the pump is turned on, it pulls fluid from the reservoir and sprays it over the windshield. Figure shows various components of windshield wiper system

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The following are the uses of the windshield wiper system: 1. The wiper cleans the front and rear windshields of the vehicle 2. Removal of water and snow 3. Removal of dirt 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL Wiper blade is usually made up of rubber compound. There are three different combinations of rubber compound used for blade material i.e. natural rubber, synthetic

rubber, natural-synthetic rubber. The characteristics of rubber are crucial for wiping quality at various temperatures. Because rubber stiffens as it becomes cold, it's the most difficult to obtain a high wiping quality at the coldest temperatures. Galvanized steel is used for the connecting and driving links, as well as the pivots that move the wipers. Galvanization is the process of coating steel with zinc to protect it from corrosion. Galvanized steel is also used for the wiper suspension and claws. Small parts of wipers, including as washers, screws, nuts, springs, motor and brackets, are made of steel. Aluminium is used for manufacturing of blade frame. A pivot socket, a spring steel sheet, two end ferrules, and a rubber strip are the main components of a windshield wiper blade. The spring steel sheet is an important component of the wiper blade because it creates dispersive pressure, which ensures that all portions of the blade can carry average load equally, making the windscreen scratch and rain-resistant. The process elaborates different raw material preparation aspects, but production unit under discussion uses steel & rubber sheets along with rest of the parts of wiper assembly i.e. rubber compounding & it’s respective sheet manufacturing is outsourced. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Following are the steps for manufacturing of rubber blades- 1. Preparation of rubber compound - A two-roller mill or an internal mixer is used for mixing of different rubber compounds. In the case of an internal mixer, it can be done in a single-stage or double-stage mixing, with the master batch being finished on a two-roll mill after it has been created in the internal mixer. 2. Shaping of rubber blades - The blades can be prepared by compression moulding or extrusion process. 3. Curing of rubber blades – After shaping curing is done to get desired mechanical properties using LCM or a microwave.

4. Cutting and trimming – cutting and trimming is required to give rubber blades final shape and size. It is also done for deburring purpose. 5. Surface treatment – polymer is used for surface coating of blades. Steps involved in assembly of different components of windshield wiper system- 1. Pivot shaft assembly - The shaft assembly consists of the pivot shaft and a rubber washer, metal washer, nut, nut cap, knurled driver, washer, and acorn nut. The wiper arm will sit on the knurled driver, which will prevent it from moving off the shaft, and the washer and acorn nut will maintain the arm in place. A washer and spring clip are then used to attach the pivot shaft to the small connecting link. Depending on the configuration of the pivot and link, a pin on the pivot shaft can be placed in one of three pin positions when the shaft is linked to the link. 2. Steel bracket - A U-shaped galvanized steel bracket is attached to the tiny connecting link on the lone pivot shaft with two shaft screws for a single-arm wiper design. The drive link will be connected to the opposite end of the bracket later. In a system with two wipers, the passenger-side wiper's small connecting link is attached to the end of the longer connecting link with shaft screws through a bracket. Similarly, a bracket is affixed to the other end of the longer connecting link on the small connecting link for the driver's side wiper. 3. Electric motor – the drive link is attached to the motor in this step. Motor consists of worm gear reduction mechanism and other linkages. The drive link must be properly fastened on the cam (drive arm) at the end of the gear shaft not only for the wiper to sweep correctly but also to park in the exact place under the vehicle moulding. 4. Spacer washers are inserted if necessary between cam and driving shaft. 5. Linkages constructed of springs are added to connect each pivot shaft to the driving link in the final phases of constructing the windshield wiper system. The pivots are linked to the wiper arms and blades. The wipers are likewise placed in their park positions, and the starter on the motor is adjusted to the park position.

PROJECT REPORT ON ‘SUGAR GLOBULES (HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE)’ INTRODUCTION: The project proposes to manufacture Sugar Globules which is an adjutant for taking Homeopathic medicines. Homeopathy is a medical science developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician. It is based on the principle that “like cures like”. In simple words, it means that any substance, which can produce symptoms in a healthy person, can cure similar symptoms in a person who is sick. This idea is referred to as the “Law of Similars“, and was understood by Aristotle and Hippocrates and mentioned in ancient Hindu manuscripts. It was Hahnemann, however, who turned it into a science of healing. PRODUCT AND ITS APPLICATION As progress of Medical Science increasing day by day likewise the side effect of allopathic medicines are also being seen in the world. Looking to the adverse effect of allopathic medicines population of this era is moving towards the Ayurvedic & 2

Homeopathic Medicines because it is well known that adverse effect of homeopathic & Ayurvedic medicines are quite low. Therefore, demand of homeopathic medicines is increasing day by day, looking to the demand of Homeopathic drugs, demand of sugar globules is also increasing because Homeopathic medicines can only be taken with sugar globules of water due to sweet in nature & easy solubility in mouth sugar globules are mainly being used by homeopathic doctors. The sugar globules have good absorption power than other globules and easily absorbs by the homeopathic drug without any change in composition & property. MARKET : Basic consumption of sugar globules is in homeopathy, because drug used in homeopathy is either to be taken with sugar globules or water. Therefore due to sweet taste these globules are being used by doctors or physician of homeopathy. Basic difference between manufacturing cost & ceiling prize is very high, hence it can be sale to wholesalers only. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE The major activities and their implementation schedule are furnished below. The assessment of the items required for implementation of the project has been considered and accounted from the date of sanction of the loan: Sno Activities Period in No. months 1 Application to financial institutions, 1 submission of documents, certificates for loan and other formalities 1 Placement of orders for machinery and 2 equipments and application for power connection 3 Procurement of raw materials 1 1 Clearing machinery, installation, 4 electrification etc. 5 Trial and commercial production 1 Total 5 3

BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: The project has been drafted taking into account of the following aspects : 1. No. of working shift in a day One 2 Duration of shift in term of time 8 hours 3 Number of working days in a year 300 4 Working efficiency of the units in first year 65% 5 Building (built up are) will be in accordance with the provision laid down by FSSAI. 6 The estimates are drawn from a production capacity generally considered techno-economically viable for a modern type of manufacturing unit. 7 The wages of the Staff & Labour is taken as per the prevailing Labour Wages Laws. 8 The entire expenditure will be borne by entrepreneur. 9 The rate of interest has been shown as applicable.-11% 10 Plant & Machinery, Testing equipment & all other equipments used in manufacturing such type of products may also be employed in manufacturing all other similar type medicines. 11 Although the unit is free from pollution & effluent discharge but still provision of exhaust fan may ensure the fresh environment. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Manufacturing process of sugar globules may be shown as following :- 1. Grinding of sugar. 2. Formation of Globules 3. Drying 4. Coating 1. Grinding : Sugar is grinded by grinder to fine mesh & further filter through sieve to remove unwanted material if any. 2. Formation of Globules: 4

Powdered sugar mixed with water & paste is formed. This paste is rubbed on the surface of sieve to prepare granules of sugar. 3. Drying : These granules are dried in trey drier to remove/eliminate moisture of the product. 4. Coating : Dried sugar globules transferred in to coating machine having arrangement of spray drier for coating with sugar solution to desired size Colour of the product should be translucent or opaque in nature. POLLUTION CONTROL: There is no pollution, however, unit has to obtain N. O. C. from Pollution Control Authorities. MANPOWER Following Manpower is required for starting Manufacturing unit : - Chemist 1 Production Supervisor 1 Skilled worker 2 Semi skilled worker 2 Accountant 1 Sales 1 Guard 1 Peon 1 Total 10 POWER AND FUEL Proper Arrangements for the Electricity Connection Load has to be made from the Concerned State Electricity Board. Total connected load (KW) : 25 In Addition to the Connection Load taken, Arrangements for DG Set shall also be done as per requirement. BANK LOAN Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11.00% DEPRECIATION Depreciation has been calculated as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 5

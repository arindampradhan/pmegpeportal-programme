AUTOMATIC MIST BASED SANITIZER DISPENSING MACHINE Introduction: Corona Virus disease (Covid19) is wreaking havoc in the world. Ever since WHO announced it as a Pandemic disease and many cities are under lockdown, people are not able to step out of their homes and already thousands have lost their lives. Automatic mist based sanitizer dispensing systems is very useful resource in the fight against corona virus. This contact less dispensing system helps to sanitize hands without getting in contact with the sanitizing surfaces and will help to reduce spread through cross contamination. This contactless dispensing unit sprays alcohol based sanitizer when both hands are placed under it. The aerated mist based formula uses only 5- 6ml. of sanitizer ensuring optimum usage. It releases full cone spray mist for 12 seconds in single operation. Contactless technology works on Ultrasonic sensor to ensure zero touch, high operational precision to completely disinfect both hands at once. It could be wall mountable with LEDs displays to indicate on/off status and the progress of the process. The capacity tank ensures longer duration of usage thus eliminating hassle of refilling it frequently. The sanitizer container allows displaying the quantity in it.

Market Potential: This dispenser is contactless and will spray sanitizer for sanitization of hands while entering into the buildings like Hospitals, Office complexes, shopping Malls, auditoriums , public places, apartments, schools, colleges, places of workship, other public places etc. There are very few units manufacturing Automatic mist based sanitizer dispensing machine in India. In the present scenario, it is very much important to equip all public places with automatic sanitizer dispensing unit. Due to the spread of Covid-19, there is enough demand for this product. Raw Material: Major raw material and parts are as follows: 1. Pre-assembled Electronic Board with Microcontroller 2. ABS Enclosure with Sanitizer container 8L 3. Ultrasonic Sensor 4. Electronic Solenoid valve 5. Diaphragm pump 6. Mist atomizer 7. SMPS 8. Connecting wires and other components 9. Packing Cartons Machinery Requirement: Major machineries & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Rate Price 1 Digital multi-meter 5 15000 75000 2 Digital liquid flow meter 2 12500 25000 3 Desktops i7 processor with 2TB 4 75000 300000 HDD,8GB RAM and microcontroller programmer 4 Drilling machine 4 10000 40000

5. Bench Grinder (Portable) 1 10000 10000 6. Tool Kit, Temp. controlled soldering Ls 100000 stations and accessories Total Amount 550000 Manufacturing Process: The preassembled programmed microcontroller board and other Electro mechanical components are mounted inside the back compartment of ABS cabinet, electrical wiring and mechanical fittings are made. Switches, LEDs etc are fixed to the front side enclosure. Place the sanitizer tank having the required capacity (8L in this case) in the front compartment of ABS enclosure. Fix the mist atomizer and Ultrasonic sensor in the lower portion of the unit. The Automatic Mist based sanitizer Dispensing machine is tested for required performance by adding alcohol based sanitizer in the container and proper power source. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 5 Lac (Approx.) for 1500 Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 10 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain

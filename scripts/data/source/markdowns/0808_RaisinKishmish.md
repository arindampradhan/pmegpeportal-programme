RAISIN(Kishmish) MANUFACTURING UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION: The project of establishing Raisin Manufacturing unit has to be developed in an area where grapes production is high. Raisins are highly acceptable product and have huge market if established in selective environment. Export market is even good in terms of profitability, if produced with international standard quality. Initially project should be focused on developing credibility in domestic market and then after maturity, there should be focus on export market. The main feature of the project would include hygienically produced raisins (dehydrated grapes up to 80-85%). Value addition will be done is form of quality processing, i.e. washing, drying, sorting & standardized packaging. 2. PRODUCT & ITS APPLICATION: Sweet, tasty and delicious raisins are a great snack just as they are or can add flavor to almost any favorite recipe, can be eaten by hand & mixed with other dishes and fruits. It is used in various traditional dishes i.e. Pulao, Halwa etc.and also consumed in modern shapes as pulp, juices, paste, cereals, and snacks etc. Raisins as a part of the daily diet provide essential nutrients, soluble & insoluble fiber and health protective bioactive compounds. Raisins have proven its effectiveness for the health aspects. Raisins reduce the risk of developing various diseases i.e. constipation, heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer and obesity. Raisins add a touch of sunshine to breads, muffins, cookies, cakes, pies, tarts and puddings etc. As bakery products are one of the major highlights of food industry, it makes the commercial importance of raisin even higher. Raisins are also used in a variety of dishes. In many places raisins are used in place of sugar.

3. DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROMOTER: Successful running this project does not require any specific qualification. 4. INDUSTRY LOOKOUT AND TRENDS In years of oversupply, the RAC can also implement the Raisin Industry Diversion Program, in which growers voluntarily participate in programs aimed at reducing supply. Program participants are reimbursed for either removing vines or spur pruning to reduce fruit production (due to a recent U. S. Supreme Court decision, these provisions are currently suspended, being reviewed, and will be amended) (Raisin Administrative Committee, 2015) (USDA – AMS, 2015). Green grapes have about 24 percent sugar. However, by reducing water in grapes, the proportion of sugar increases to roughly 60 percent by weight in raisins. It takes between 4 to 4.5 pounds of green grapes to make a pound of raisins (Martin & Mason, 2009). One way to add value to raisins is to remind customers of their versatility. Raisins can be substituted in many recipes that call for other dried fruit. They can also be added to savory dishes, creating a more balanced flavor profile (California Raisin Marketing Board – Recipes, 2015). Fresh raisins can be used in baked goods as a natural sweetener and flavor enhancer. They can be used in trail mix, cereals, and granola, and can provide moisture for soft and chewy cookies, as well as control breakage in crisp cookies (California Raisin Marketing Board – Products, 2015). Another way to add value to your raisins is by processing them. Raisin paste can be used as a binder in fruit bars in place of other, more expensive fruit pastes, such as date paste (Fuentes, 2014). Raisin paste can add healthy fiber to baked goods, and its rich deep colour can add visual appeal. Raisin juice concentrate can be used as a natural colouring agent and can add flavor to sauces and marinades, as well as be used as syrup for yogurts, ice cream and chocolate milk. Raisins also have antimicrobial properties, thus adding value to products in which they’re used by extending the shelf life (California Raisin Marketing Board – Products, 2015).

5. MARKET POTENTIAL AND MARKETING ISSUES, IF ANY: The project is highly dependent upon the availability of Grapes. So keeping in view the seasonal production of grapes, it is suggested that the project may be initiated between July and September. However, value addition can be done through this facility by utilizing round the year production of other varieties of grapes. The target customers for processed raisins would primarily be individuals, dry fruit whole sellers& retailers, confectionary and medicine industry. After certain period of operations and market capture, project can be expanded into tackling export market with international quality production of raisins and packaging. 6. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The primary raw material for making raisins is grapes. These grapes must have certain qualities in order to produce quality raisins i.e. they must ripen early. Additionally, they must be clean, have a soft texture, not stick together when stored, and have a pleasing flavor. For food grade packaging, it requires food quality HDPE/cardboard boxes. 7. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: Typical process of manufacturing raisins requires following steps. First step to producing good raisins is growing quality grapes. Grape farming is a year-round commitment and includes the practices of pruning, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Then, the grapes are harvested. Depending on the weather, the grapes are allowed to dry on the trays for two to four weeks. During this time, the moisture content of the grape is reduced from 75% to under 15% and the color of the fruit changes to a brownish purple. After the fruit is dried, the paper trays are rolled up around the raisins to form a package. The rolls are gathered and stored in boxes or bins before being transported by truck to a processing plant. When the rolls of fruit arrive at the manufacturing plant, they are emptied out onto wire screens and shaken to remove dirt and other unwanted debris. The dried grapes are moved from the storage bins to the processing plant. Here they are emptied out onto a conveyor line and mechanically modified. The residual sand and other debris are first removed by running the

raisins on a fine mesh screen while air is blown on them. Immature fruit is removed by suction devices. Next, the raisins are separated from the bunch stem by shaking. The cap stems on each raisin are removed by being passed through two rotating conical surfaces. If there are seeds in the raisins, they are mechanically removed. When all these processing steps are completed, the raisins are run through a series of mesh screens to sort them according to size. At this point the raisins can be put into a variety of packaging. They are packed onto trucks and shipped to customers. Quality control is an important part of each step in the raisin making process. They are also subjected to a variety of laboratory analyses to ensure the production of a consistent, high quality product.

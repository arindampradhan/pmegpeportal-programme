TOMATO PUREE PLANT Introduction: Tomato puree is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato puree, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce. The definitions of tomato puree vary from country to country. In the U. S., tomato puree is a processed food product, usually consisting of only tomatoes, but can also be found in the seasoned form. It differs from tomato sauce or tomato paste in consistency and content; tomato puree generally lacks the additives common to a complete tomato sauce and does not have the thickness of paste. To prepare tomato puree, ripe tomatoes are washed and the sepals and stem are removed. Some processors remove the skin of the tomato as well. The fruit flesh is then mashed or mechanically chopped to the desired consistency. Uses & Market Potential: Tomato puree can be used in soups, stews, sauces, or any other dish where the tomato flavour is desired, but not the texture. The most basic use of Tomato Purée is to make sauces and dips. It is used to make Italian Sauces like Pizza sauce and also Basic Tomato Cream sauce for pasta. Hot and Sweet sauce is a perfect dip to be served with French

fries and other wraps and is simply made by combining tomato puree with sugar, salt and vinegar. The India tomato processing market is currently experiencing strong growth. India is the world’s second largest tomato producer after China and currently accounts for 11% of the total global tomato production. The majority of the tomatoes produced in the country are consumed fresh with the remaining being processed into products such as tomato paste, tomato juice, tomato sauce, tomato Puree, etc. Driven by rising disposable incomes and westernization of food consumption patterns, the fast food industry has been witnessing strong growth in the country. Ingredients: The main ingredients of tomato puree are tomatoes, salt, sugar, chemicals enough to submerge the tomatoes or flavours. The types of sweetener used are usually granulated cane sugar or beet sugar. Other sweeteners include dextrose or liquid sugar in the form of corn or glucose syrup. Average raw material cost per Kg: Rs. 22-25 Machinery & equipments: Machinery for Tomato Puree includes the following: 1. Pulping processing line a. Fruit washing machine b. Sorting/ inspection conveyor c. Screw feeder d. Fruit Mill Crusher e. Hopper tyre pump f. Twin pulper g. Pulprizer h. Steam Jacketted Kettle i. Transfer pump

Double seamer d. Round can body beader e. Steam boiler Tomato puree machines is mainly used to produce final tomato puree from the raw material. With the help of these machines the work of washing, pulping, mixing, homogenizing, boiling, filling, canning & sealing completes in a very short span. This set up of all machines will cost Rs. 30 Lac (Approx). Manufacturing Process: Step by step process is mentioned below:  Procurement of tomatoes.  Firstly, washing of tomatoes and then sort the good quality tomatoes.  After that put the chopped tomato into the twin pulper, which separate seeds, skins, and stems from the pulp.  Cooking & add ingredients: Then the pulp is pumped into cooking tanks or kettles and heated to boiling. Foaming may occur if fresh tomato pulp is used, but can be corrected with anti-foaming compounds or compressed air. Precise amounts of salt, spices, and flavourings are added to the tomato pulp. Most spices are added early in the cooking process.  Finishing: Once the cooking is complete, the puree mixture passes through a finishing machine. Finishers remove excess fibre and particles through screens, creating a smoother consistency.

 Cooling  Canning process of tomato puree.  Labelling & Packaging Tomato puree and paste are formed by concentrating tomato pulp by removing the water. The moisture can be removed by careful heating or by pressing the pulp through a filter or drip bag. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2000 to 2500Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 12 including 1 Supervisor, 3 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

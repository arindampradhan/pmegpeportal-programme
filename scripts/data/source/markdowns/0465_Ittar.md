ITTAR (PERFUME) MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction Ittar also known as attar, is an essential oil derived from botanical sources. Most commonly these oils are extracted via hydro or steam distillation. Ibn Sina, the Persian physician was first to derive the attar of flowers from distillation. Attar can also be expressed by chemical means but generally natural perfumes which qualify as ittars are distilled with water. The oils are generally distilled into a wood base such as sandalwood and then aged. The aging period can last from one to ten years depending on the botanicals used and the results desired. Technically ittars are distillates of flowers, herbs, spices and other natural materials such as baked soil over sandalwood oil/liquid paraffins using hydro distillation technique with deg and bhapka. These techniques are still in use today at Kannauj in India. Jasmine ittar was the favorite perfume of the Nizams of the Hyderabad state. Traditionally in the Eastern world, it was a customary practice of nobility to offer ittar to their guests at the time of their departure. The ittars are traditionally given in ornate tiny crystal cut bottles called as itardans. This tradition of giving a scent to one's guests continues to this day in many parts of the Eastern world. Among Sufi worshipers the use of Ittars during meditation circles and dances is quite common Perfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent. It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body. Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarone, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone. The word perfume derives from the Latin perfumer, meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization and

maybe Ancient China. It was further refined by the Romans and the Arabs. In India, perfume and perfumery existed in the Indus civilization. Uses & types Ittars are generally classified based on their perceived effect on the body. 'Warm' ittars such as musk, amber and kesar (saffron) are used in winter, as they are believed to increase body temperature. Likewise, 'cool' ittars such as rose, jasmine, khus, kewda and mogra are used in summers for their perceived cooling effect on the body. Although ittars are mostly used as a perfume, they are also used for medicinal and aphrodisiacal purposes. Musk This class of aromatic compound is produced by "Moschus moschiferus", a rare species of the male deer found in the Himalaya. The substance used in creating Musk can only be produced by a mature male Moschus, and the process of acquiring it involves killing the deer. As such, its demand has led to the endangerment of most musk deer species, which in turn has aided the rise of synthetic musk, known as 'white musk'. Natural musk is commonly mixed with medicines and confectionary. Purported medicinal benefits range from working as an antivenom and strengthening organs. Agarwood Historically, Oud has been traded and cherished among perfumers, healers, alchemists and oil traders. Some of the claimed medicinal uses include pain reduction and stress relief. Sandalwood Sandalwood oil is popularly used in incense for its reputed calming effect during meditation.

Rose Rose oils are obtained by steam-distilling the crushed petals of roses, a by-product of which is rose water. Rose oil has been used since ancient times in ittars, as well as within emollients and as an anti-inflammatory agent. Hina Known scientifically as Lawsonia Alba, hina is traditional used as a 'warm' ittar during cooler seasons. Ambergris Also known as Anbar, this waxy substance is excreted by the sperm whale and retrieved from beaches and the sea. It is thought to have been used by humans for at least 1,000 years, and has a musky aroma. Ambrein, an alcohol used as a scent preservative, is extracted from ambergris. Jasmine Jasmine oil, derived from Jasmine flowers, has a potent floral aroma and is a popular expensive ingredient in perfumes. Fragrance Notes Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, making the harmonious scent accord. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.  Top notes: Also called the head notes. The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander.  Middle notes: Also referred to as heart notes. The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note.

The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine.  Base notes: The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk. The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a fragrance pyramid, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed. Ingredients some of the important ingredients of Ittar & perfume include – rose flower extraction, carrier oil & water. Description of Machine & Equipment’s Machinery & Equipment’s includes the following:  Heating tank  Base oil tank  Cooling tank  Separation tank  Pump  furnace These Machines are used to produce final product from different types of raw material. With the help of this machine the work of steaming, formulation & packaging completes in a very short span.

Ittar Market Analysis According to industry estimates, the overall size of the Indian fragrance (Ittar & perfume) industry is currently estimated at Rs. 2000 crores, projected to grow by 50 percent (Rs.3000 crores) by the year 2020. The current online perfume market is estimated at Rs.148 crores projected to grow by approximately 120% to Rs 345 crores. Ittar Manufacturing Process  Loading heating tank: Fill half of heating tank with water and add 10Kg flowers in tank.  Sealing of heating tank: Sealing of heating tank is done manually by using mud and sealing wood.  Starting Furnace: Firewood is added to furnace and fire is ignited, which continues for 8 to 10 hrs.  Extraction of Steam: The steam is extracted via Bamboo Pipes Insulated via ropes. It’s one end is connected to heating tank and other to base oil tank.  Condensation of Steam: The steam obtained from heating tank is condensed back into liquid [Water + Fragrance Oil] in base oil tank which is filled with 20 kg of base oil. It’s achieved by placing base oil tank in cooling tank, thus completing Distillation Process.  Separation: Every day in evening i.e. after 7 to 9 hrs the furnace is put off and the contents of base oil tank is supplied to separation tank where its left for an hour which allows oil [Base Oil + Fragrance Oil] and water to separate which is followed by extraction of both separately.  Enrichment: The oil is supplied to base oil tank and water to heating tank followed by introduction of new load of flowers in heating tank and repetition of distillation process to enrich base oil with fragrance oil. This process is repeated for 12 to 15 days.  Packaging: The oil obtained after enrichment is finished perfume product which is bottled and labelled with brand logo.

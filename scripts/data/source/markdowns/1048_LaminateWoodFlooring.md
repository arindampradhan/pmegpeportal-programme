1. INTRODUCTION Laminate flooring is a multi-layer synthetic flooring product fused together with a lamination process. Laminate flooring simulates wood (or sometimes stone) with a photographic applique layer under a clear protective layer. The inner core layer is usually composed of melamine resin and fiber board materials. Laminate flooring has grown significantly in popularity, perhaps because it may be easier to install and maintain than more traditional surfaces such as hardwood flooring. It may also have the advantages of costing less and requiring less skill to install than alternative flooring materials. It is reasonably durable, hygienic (several brands contain an antimicrobial resin), and relatively easy to maintain. Laminate floors are reasonably easy for a DIY homeowner to install. Laminate flooring is packaged as a number of tongue and groove planks, which can be clicked into one another. Sometimes a glue backing is provided for ease of installation. Installed laminate floors typically "float" over the sub-floor on top of a foam/film underlayment, which provides moisture- and sound-reducing properties. A small (1–10 millimetres (0.039–0.394 in)) gap is required between the flooring and any immovable object such as walls, this allows the flooring to expand without being obstructed. Baseboards (skirting boards) can be removed and then reinstalled after laying of the flooring is complete for a neater finish, or the baseboard can be left in place with the flooring butted into it, then small beading trims such as shoe moulding or the larger quarter-round moulding can be fitted to the bottoms of the baseboards.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Laminate floors are a hybrid floor covering consisting of a particleboard wood base topped by an image layer and a transparent wear layer. Laminate floors are a popular type of floor covering for homes' living areas, kitchens, dining areas, bedrooms, hallways, and other areas that are not subject to excessive moisture. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS 1. Before pressing (manual or automatic)  Clean the wear-resistant paper/melamine woodgrain paper/balance paper  Spread the balance paper in the bottom, then HDF/woodgrain paper/wear-resistant paper in sequence;  Convey the sandwich structure into main press 2. Pressing  The temperature of heating plate is 170-210 ºC, pressure is around 25Mpa. Temperature and pressure will be adjusted by the paper weight.  In pressing, we will make many types of laminate flooring, like. The different designs or grains are on the stainless-steel mold plates.  The heating plate will go down press the sandwich structure and keep the pressure for several seconds. The cycle time is around 45 seconds. 3. Manual Discharge:  After pressing process finished, heating plate goes up and workers push the finished panel out of the main press with wood sticks to the discharge shelf 4. Cooling Shelf:  The finished panel will be conveyed to cooling shelf one by one 5. Cutting the board: After cooling, we will cut the boards into 2 pieces or 3 pieces then cutting into flooring pieces.

6. Balance in condition room: The boards after cutting need fit the temperature and moisture in the factory. The flooring boards need stay in the conditioning room for 1 week in summer and 3- 5 days in winter. Without balance, the laminate flooring boards will have the problems of bending, cupping and warping. 7. Tongue and Groove: Square edge and moulded edges flooring are the final product. For U or V grooves flooring, the edges will be sealed by wax. 8. Package: Final step is the packing. Laminate flooring will be packed by carton and pallet.

3 PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 2000 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project. It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.30,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.1000 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 500 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 300 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Multi-rips cutting line: This is use to cut the all-laminated sheets in equal size before pressing.  Laminate flooring DET (Double End Tenoner) production line: In this process the all sheets are used to pressed and form a single sheet.

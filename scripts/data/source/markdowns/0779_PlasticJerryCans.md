PLASTIC JERRY CANS Introduction: A Jerry can is a container that is used to store liquid. The Jerry cans have become a perfect storage container as they are available in different sizes, shapes, and designs. Additionally, Jerry Cans are also available in several colors which depict different materials being stored. For example, red color depicts gasoline, yellow is for diesel and blue color donates kerosene. Plastic gas cans are cheaper, lighter, and less bulky than metal ones, and more user-friendly. They are constructed from HDPE (Food Grade) Plastic, so are perfectly safe for storing drinking water. Jerry cans are widely used for carrying several dangerous goods including chemicals, as well as diesel and petrol fuels owing to which these cans have to adhere to several regulations and standards laid down by government organizations across different countries. This project report explains the manufacturing process for 5Ltr Jerry can having approximate weight of 200gram each. The project cost may vary with the product variations. Uses & Market Potential: Based on material, the global jerry can market has been segmented into plastic and metal. Plastic based jerry can segment accounts for the largest share in the global jerry can market. Plastic

being a lightweight, durable, corrosion-resistant, and chemically inert material is widely used for producing jerry cans of various shapes and sizes. High-density polyethylene is one of the most commonly used plastic material for manufacturing jerry cans. High-density polyethylene is a comparatively low-cost material owing to which it is one of the most widely preferred materials across the packaging industry. In addition, it offers excellent resistance to most solvents and has a good low-temperature resistance. Furthermore, it exhibits a strong barrier against moisture. All these properties, in turn, make it ideal for manufacturing jerry cans. The global Jerry cans market is expected to witness a CAGR of around 3% during the forecast period primarily driven by the growth in the chemicals, oil and lubricant industry. Besides, features associated with jerry cans like the leak proof quality, moisture resistant factor, and odourless feature further accelerates the demand for the jerry cans market.

Manufacturing Process: In plastic jerry can manufacturing, HDPE plastic resin (white or coloured) are used. At first, the raw material is procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. The composition of pellets is 97-98 % pellets are of pure HDPE. In this HDPE resins, 2-3% resins of the master colour of the cans are added to impart the necessary colour. The mixture is rotated at high rpm in the rotary mixer so that it is uniformly distributed and thoroughly mixed. Profile dies are mounted into the molding machine as per the desired dimension of the jerry can after approval from the production team. In the next step, the barrel heaters are started and brought to the desired temperature to melt down the thermoplastic pellets. The resins are added into the hopper of the extruder. From the hopper, these plastic pellets come into the feed section of the barrel. There is a screw inside the barrel which rotates about the vertical axis and moves the pellets into the heating section of the barrel where these plastic pellets melt to a semi-solid state and are ready to be injected into the mold of the machine. The molten plastic comes out from extruder at the desired pressure. The profile extruded is called a parison. In jerry cans, there is a requirement of a equal concentration of material at the base as compared to the top. The amount of material is precisely controlled by sensors and controllers. In the next step, when the parison reaches the blowpipe of Blow Moulding Machine, the dies of the machine get closed. Compressed air is blown at desired pressure through the blowpipe. Under air compression, the parison acquires the desired shape of the die. After this, the mould dies are cooled using water flow arrangements for the desired cooling time cycle. The molten plastic solidifies and gets separated. Excess lines are trimmed off. In the next step, the jerry cans are inspected for any quality defects. After this, they are packed and dispatched in the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft.

Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 12 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 3 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 Approvals & Registration Requirement: Basic registration required in this project:  GST Registration  Udyog Aadhar Registration (Optional)  Choice of a Brand Name of the product and secure the name with Trademark if require.  NOC from State Pollution Control Board

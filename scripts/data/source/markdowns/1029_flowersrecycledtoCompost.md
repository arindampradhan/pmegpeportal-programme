1. INTRODUCTION Worshiping is a way of life in India, and people offer various offerings to the gods, including flowers, leaves, fruits, coconuts, clothing, and other objects, the majority of which are floral offerings. As a result, flower waste makes up a significant portion of temple waste. Flowers, like any waste, end up in the trash or are thrown into water bodies or left on open spaces as waste, creating various environmental issues. Rose, jasmine, marigold, chrysanthemum, hyacinth, hibiscus, and other flowers are commonly offered in temples. This floral waste can be used in different ways to create useful items, saving the world from contamination caused by inappropriate flower waste disposal. Effect on environment The environment is described as the sum of all the conditions and circumstances, as well as the living and non-living things, that affect the life of an organism. In order to maintain natural balance and equilibrium, humans and ecosystems are inextricably intertwined. Emission levels have risen dramatically as a result of population and productivity, resulting in environmental degradation. The exploitation of natural resources, industrialization, urbanization, and other factors are the key causes of environmental degradation. Pollution of all kinds, including air, water, and soil, as well as solid waste and its disposal, wreak havoc on the atmosphere and human health.

Value addition of Holy wastes In addition to being used for certain art and craft techniques, this flower waste may be used to make compost. Most flowers and their plant parts are good compost ingredients. Significance of product Compost is an organic soil enrichment that combines greens — such as newly cut flowers, other fresh yard waste and kitchen scraps rich in nitrogen — and browns that are high in carbon, including dried flowers. Composting is good for several reasons: It saves water by helping the soil hold moisture and reduce water runoff. It benefits the environment by recycling organic resources while conserving landfill space. Enriches soil, helping retain moisture and suppress plant diseases and pests. Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Encourages the production of beneficial bacteria and fungi that break down organic matter to create humus, a rich nutrient-filled material.

2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES The basic use of compost-like products is conditioning and fertilising soil by the addition of humus, nutrients and beneficial soil bacteria. This helps improving the physical and chemical properties and contributes to enhance the capacity of the soil to store air and water. 2.2 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Making Compost from Flower Waste have the following steps:  The flower waste is collected from the sources like temples, ghats, etc.  The flowers are sorted to separate them from the other waste such as thread and plastics.  Then flower petals are taken to the dryer unit where the moisture content is removed.  Dry flowers then undergo to grinding process into a shredding machine to make a fine powder which reduces the volume of waste. It will enhance its decomposition.  Grounded Powder is then taken to ribbon blender for mixing with composting culture and sawdust. The sawdust helps to generate heat and reduce moisture from the flowers which is good for the entire biological process whereas composting culture (Mesophilic bacteria) is responsible for carrying out the decomposition of flower waste. Since the bacteria are mesophilic, it can exist at a moderate temperature of 20-45 degrees Celsius.  The mixed material is then taken to the flower composting machine where the compost is being prepared. It takes waste as its input and provides manure as its output.  The biological process in that takes 20 to 25 days after which the compost is ready.  The final product is packed in appropriate packages and is shipped to customer. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land & Building The land required for this manufacturing unit will be approx. around 1500 square feet. Land Purchase and Building Civil Work Cost have not been considered as part of the cost of project.

It is expected that the premises will be on rental and approximate rentals assumed of the same will be Rs.25,000 per month.  Workshop Area- This area includes the setup and foundation space for all equipment’s, work floor area, etc. Total workshop area is approx.900 Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 300 Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space. Total workshop area is approx. 200 Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electric Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 100 Sqft. Land and building requirement may vary depending on the size of project. 3.2 Plant & Machinery  Dehydrator machine: Dehydrator machine is used for dry or dehydrated floral petals before grinding. This appliance uses a flow of hot air to minimize the average amount of water contained in floral petals.  Shredding Machine: Shredding machine is used for shredding and converting the floral petals into fine particles before placing them into a mixer.

 Ribbon Blender: Ribbon Blender is a light-duty blender mainly used for easy-to- mix powder components that are pre-processed like dried granules, pre-sieved powders, etc.  Flower Waste Composting Machine: An organic waste composting machine is an independent unit that facilitates the composting process and provides better composts. It takes waste as its input and provides manure as its output.

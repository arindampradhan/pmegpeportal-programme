READY TO EAT NOODLE I. Introduction: Cereals like wheat, rice, maize and millets are staple food grain for majority of population around the world. These are the rich source of carbohydrates and supply of calorie and other nutrients to the consumers. Apart from value addition by processing to traditional products from these grains, development of newer products offers Variety, Convenience, Quality, Cost efficiency and Scope for increasing nutritional value. In the developed countries many convenience foods are prepared by extrusion process using extruder, as it offers a large number of desired characteristic to be incorporated in the product. NOODLES are a form of pasta that is becoming extremely popular in India even as Continental and Italian delicacy. Instant Noodles is prepared by means of an extrusion machine that is basically made of an stainless steel make strips, either flat(rolled and Cut ) or Oval round(Extruded). The process is quite simple and requires not much skilled labour. The machine itself is high technology and provides the manufacturers to produce pasta with several alternatives materials (like Maida, Suji, Rava, Rice flour and so on) and in different shapes ( like Spaghetti, Fettuccini, Vermicelli, Maccaroni, Fusilli, Penne, etc. ) of Pasta and Noodles. These products can be described as Hard, Brittle pieces, Formed into different shapes by extruding , cutting and drying tough dough made from semolina or farina mixed with water. II. Market Potential & Scope: This type of ready‐to‐eat food items is very popular in the developed countries because of its versatility of form, composition and ease of preparation at consumer end, which has made these products so widely, accepted world over. There is a very large and growing market. Urban market is captured by some national brands as mentioned earlier. But there is a good scope in semi‐urban and certain rural markets as the branded products which are sold at about Rs. 100/‐ per kg. are considered to be costly. At the same time, these markets are familiar with noodles due to constant hammering by the established brands by way of advertisements. Thus, it will not amount to concept selling. A good product with attractive packaging and affordable price of around Rs.60‐65 per kg has good potential. Creation of proper distribution network and product advertisement through vernacular media is also necessary. In other words, good quality, affordable pricing and concentration on semi‐urban and upcoming rural markets are the key factors. At present the market of Noodles, especially in the urban areas, is dominated by brands likes MAGGI & TOP RAMAN. Some medium & small companies are also engaged in its production. The presence of a demand supply gap can be observed which may leads ample scope for a unit to come up in this product sector to cater especially to the semi urban and rural sectors of north India. Besides the boom in the food service sector including fast food chain, has widened the demand potential for Noodles. Experiments have shown that advertisement and publicity have influenced the pattern of consumption of Noodles/ Pasta products. Besides, Noodles/ Pasta products have good export potential especially in the Middle East/ Europe.

III. Basis & Presumption: 1. The Project Profile has been prepared on the basis of Single Shift of 8‐hrs. a day and 25‐ working days in a month at 75% efficiency. 2. It is presumed that Ist year, the capacity utilization will be 70% followed by 85% in the next year and 100% in the subsequent year. 3. Depreciation on machinery & equipments has been taken @ 15% minimum. Depreciation on office furniture has been taken @ 10 % per annum. 4. The rates quoted in respect of salaries and wages for skilled worker and others are on the basis of minimum rates in the State of U. P. 5. Interest rate for the fixed and working capital has been taken @ 12% on an average whether financed by the Bankers or Financial Institutional. 6. The margin money required is minimum (25% of the total capital investment). 7. The rental value for the accommodation of office, workshop and other covered area has been taken @ Rs. 150/‐ per Sq. mtr . 8. The rate quoted in respect of machinery, equipment and raw materials are those prevailing at the time of preparation of the Project Profile and are likely to vary from place to place and suppliers to suppliers. When a tailor made project profile is prepared, necessary changes are to be made. 9. The payback period may be 5‐years after the initial gestation period. 10. The gestation period in implementation of the project may be to the tune of 6 to 9 months which includes making all arrangements, completion of all formalities, market surveys and tie‐ups etc. Once all the above arrangements are made and quality/standards achieved the 100% project capacity may be achieved at the end of three years. 11. To run the unit the balance period of the year, other fruits products such as squashes and juices can be prepared with addition of a few machinery and equipments. IV. Technical Aspect a. Manufacturing Process: Process outline: Noodles is the term being used to designate products made from blend of flour , the major component of which is rice flour, buck wheat flour , wheat flour, and from bean , potato , mung bean and corn starch. The major manufacturing process is depend on the presence or absence of gluten. Small amounts of nutrients may be added but these do not affect the organoleptic qualities or processing properties of the material. Water is added in the extrusion step and is removed by drying , except when it is sold as fresh product. Wheat flour noodles are usually produced by sheeting and rolling , while other types are typically produced by extrusion or batter cooking methods. The raw material for Rice noodles is non‐glutinous rice which is elastic and enables formation of dough that is easy for extrusion. The Traditional noodles have been modernized and globalised in the form of Instant Noodles. Both rice and wheat flour type instant noodles are steamed and dried or steamed and fried after the cutting stage. The modern instant noodle are steamed and fried in Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil , have a fat content of about 20% and added salt and edible gum and a Shelf Life of 6‐8 Month. Instant noodles are fast cooking, needing 2‐3 minute boiling or re‐hydration in boiling water. Noodles manufactured in different size, hollow as well as solid. The flavour and taste in the instant noodle is created during the re‐hydration in boiling

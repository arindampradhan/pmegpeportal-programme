PROJECT PROFILE FOR COIR PAPER/PAPER PRODUCTS MAKING UNIT INTRODUCTION Coir paper is manufactured from waste of coir fiber collected from coir processing unit and waste paper (corrugated board waste) from local market. The product finds its application in calendar, binding covers and note book covers. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE The fiber and paper strips are put into a treatment vessel and then fed into a beater along with water and sized additives to form a pulp type mixture from coir fibre/coir pith. The pulp mixture is spread on a net which enables the water to settle down and form paper sheet. These paper sheets are blotted on a woolen / gada cloth. Water is drawn out from these sheets with the help of a hydraulic press and these sheets are detached from cloth and to let dry in sunlight. After drying these sheets are passed through two heavy rollers and 1

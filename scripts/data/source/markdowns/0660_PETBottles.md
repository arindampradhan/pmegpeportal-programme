PRE-FEASIBILITY REPORT Packaging Industry „The PET Bottles Manufacturing unit‟ 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The PET Bottles Manufacturing unit is a project of Plastic Sector, in which, the most convenience-size bottles are made from Polyethylene Terephthalate. PET has become the material of choice for bottled beverages because it is lightweight and shatter resistant, and PET has been extensively tested for safety. PET resin has superior properties i.e. attractive, pure, safe, good barrier, no leakage, design flexibility, recyclable, etc. Bottles made with PET are widely used for everything from water and fruit juice to soft drinks etc. Every day, lacs of consumers rely on the safety and ease of plastic bottles to help to preserve the quality and freshness of what we drink and serve our families. Plastic make possible an array of opportunities for transporting, storing and serving our favorite beverages, and today’s convenience-size bottles are an increasingly popular choice for busy people everywhere. 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1Project Brief PET bottles are a packaging medium, made up of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) . These are widely used in food grade packaging and are the preferred packaging medium in this segment, due to their several advantages over other resins like PE, HDPE and PVE.

The objective of this pre-feasibility study is to provide information for setting up a PET bottles manufacturing unit. 2.2 Project Rationale PET bottles are used as packaging in a variety of products. The demand of PET bottles is on a rise as most of the food manufactures from different businesses are converting to PET bottles for the packaging of their products. The PET bottles/containers are commonly used for the packaging of the following: • Mineral Water • Carbonated Beverages • Edible Oil • Household Food Containers • Detergents • Paints • Lubricating Oils • Feeding Bottles for Babies As PET bottles provide better packaging, and have a lower cost than the bottles made from glass and other materials, different businesses in beverage, food and non-food industry are shifting towards PET bottles. The PET resin has superior properties, which are as follows: ♦ Attractive: Products look good, pure and healthy because of attractiveness of PET bottles. ♦ Pure: Products taste good as PET complies with international food contact regulations. ♦ Safe: PET bottles are tough and virtually unbreakable. If they do fail, they split, not shatter. Their high impact and tensile strength makes them ideal for carbonated products. ♦ Good barrier: The low permeability of PET to oxygen, carbon dioxide and water means that it protects and maintains the integrity of products giving a good shelf life. PET also has good chemical resistance. ♦ Lightweight: One tenth the weight of an equivalent glass pack, PET bottles reduce shipping costs, and because the material in the wall is thinner, shelf utilization is improved by 25% on volume compared to glass. High strength, low weight PET bottles can be stacked as high as glass. ♦ No leakage: Absolute closure integrity is possible because of the injection molded neck finish. The absence of a weld line in the base means that PET bottles have no leakage. ♦ Design flexibility: PET bottles are suitable for containers of all shapes, sizes, neck finish designs and colors. ♦ Recyclable: Used PET bottles can be washed, granulated into flakes and reshaped as PET bottles or employed as material for strapping, carpeting, fiber filling, etc. Specially designed thick-wall bottles can be washed, refilled and reused. PET is made from the same three elements (carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen) as paper, and contains no toxic substances. When burned, it produces carbon dioxide gas and water, leaving no toxic residues. Being recyclable is the most important factor of success of business of PET bottles.

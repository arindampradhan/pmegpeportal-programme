PILLOW MAKING UNIT Introduction: A pillow is a support of the body at rest for comfort, therapy, or decoration. Some types of pillows include throw pillows, body pillows, decorative pillows and many more. Pillows that aid sleeping are a form of bedding that supports the head and neck. Other types of pillows are designed to support the body when lying down or sitting. There are also pillows that consider human body shape for increased comfort during sleep. Decorative pillows used on couches or chairs are sometimes referred to as cushions. Uses & Market Potential: Having the right bed pillows is not only comforting, they play an important role in supporting the intricate structures of the head, neck, shoulders, hips, and spine. When used well, pillows help in alleviating or preventing many common forms of back and neck pain, as well as shoulder, hip, and other forms of joint pain. Pillows serve to keep the upper body in alignment during sleep, relieving pressure and counterbalancing the points in the body. The pillow should adjust to fit one's unique shape, curves, and sleeping position and alleviate any pressure points. The demand within the global pillow market has traced an ascending trajectory over the past decade. The pillow market corresponds to a broad segment of the industry, creating new opportunities for growth and development. The unprecedented demand for pillows across residential spaces is at the forefront of market growth and expansion. Furthermore, several other sectors including

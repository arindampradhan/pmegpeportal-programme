MENTTHOL CCRYSTAAL UNIIT Introdduction: Mint oil aand its derrivative mmenthol is wwidely useed as flavourring ingreddient for vvarious prooducts succh as toothh paste, deental creamm, cough ssyrups, confectionerry, pan maasala, chewwing gumss and in paain relieviing preparaations. Meentha cultiivation in India has proved quuite remunnerative too the growers, partticularly too small hoolders andd fitted well in the exxisting croppinng system in mint grrowing area in the ccountry, MMint groweers consider menthaa as a bonuus crop as it does noot disturb or replacee the cultivvation of aany major wwinter (Raabi) or rainny season (Kharif) ccrop. Being a labourr intensivee crop mentha provides variious emplooyment oppportunitiies in cultiivation, distillattion, proceessing field particullarly in rurral areas. Uses && Markeet Potenttial: Menttha oil is obtained frrom the leaves/entirre plant off various mmentha sppecies and varieties.. The Japannese mintt (Mentha arvensiis) is mainnly cultivatted in ourr country. TThe oil of Japanese mint is used as a souurce of nattural menthol and ddementhollized oil (DDMO).

After collection of the mint oil from farmers/brokers, it should be filtered prior to cooling as it usually contains some water and mucilaginous impurities, which prevent ready formation of the menthol crystals. For crystallization some producers use filter and centrifuge the oil. In the whole process menthol crystals and dementholized mint oil is formed which is packed and sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

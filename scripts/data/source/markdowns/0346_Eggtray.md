EGG TRAY Introduction An egg tray (also known as an egg box in British English) is a tray designed for carrying and transporting whole eggs. These cartons have a dimpled form in which each dimple accommodates an individual egg and isolates that egg from eggs in adjacent dimples. This structure helps protect eggs against stresses exerted during transportation and storage by absorbing a lot of shock and limiting the incidents of fracture to the fragile egg shells. An egg Tray can be made of various materials, including foamed plastics such as polystyrene foam, clear plastic or may be manufactured from recycled paper and moulded pulp by means of a mechanized papier- mâché process Functions & Advantages of Egg Tray Egg tray making machine is used to produce egg trays. Egg trays is used to pack eggs. 1. Protection Function Egg trays can protect the egg from the external shock. It can also protect the eggs from damaging and going bad due to illumination and dampness so that the loss can be reduced. 2. Convenient Transportation The purpose of producing eggs is to let them get into market, which is a process of product circulation. In this process, eggs will undergo countless times of transportation, handling, storage, which requires the

egg packing must be able to adapt to the process. Egg trays can satisfy this purpose. 3. Increasing sale In today’s market, great changes have taken place in the way of people’s purchasing. With the improvement of people’s material standard, more and more people begin to pursue a higher quality of life. The packaging quality of the products has a direct impact on sales. The egg is more typical. If we make the egg packaging exquisite and unique, it will increase the sales of eggs. Above all is function and advantage of egg packaging. We can find that egg trays have a good market prospect. If the investors have their own egg tray making machine, it will save a lot cost and earn more benefit. It is wise to buy egg tray making machine. Egg Tray Market Analysis Over the past few years, egg cartons market has been one of the fastest growing markets supplying packaging solution to the global food & beverages industry. The primary driver in global egg carton packaging market is the convenience in carrying and transporting of eggs. Egg carton manufacturers also implement various innovative ideas for the safe transportation of eggs. Also, egg cartons made of paper are recyclable in nature and thus become a very cost effective solution for the storage of eggs. All such factors fuel up to the growth of global egg cartons market. However, on the other hand, due to stiff competition in the manufacturers of plastic egg cartons and the dynamic change in the cost of raw materials that is required in manufacturing egg cartons, the market for egg cartons has suffered restricted growth. Overall, global egg cartons market is expected to show a considerable growth rate over the forecast period of 2017-2027. Description of Egg tray Machines Following machinery are required for Egg tray Manufacturing process:  Pulper  Chest Tank

 Agitator  Water Tank  Moulding Machine  Trolly  Dies Manufacturing Process Paper egg trays are everywhere in our daily life. 1. Collection of Duplex Paper: Firstly collect the Duplex Paper( 30% books & copies can be used as raw material) 2. Pulp Making: Put the waste paper into the pulp making machine, then add water and other raw materials into the pulp making machine. Smash them into pulp. This process is equivalent to the recycle of waste paper, which is the first step to make egg trays. 3. Moulding: Moulding refers to the step that convey the pulp into moulding machine through pipeline. Paper egg trays molding machine is called egg trays machine for short. Through changing molds, it can produce egg trays with different types. It can also produce apple trays, wine trays and other industrial packaging. After successful molding, the basic shape of egg trays is formed. But, they are wet at this time and needs to go through the next drying step. 4. Drying: The drying line is very long. Omni-directional and three- dimensional hot air ensures that the egg trays can be dried in short time. The wet egg trays are conveyed to the drying line and move forward slowly, enjoying the hot air from all directions. 5. Packing: This step is tiding up and packaging pieces of newborn egg trays so that they can be transported and carried easily. Dozens of egg trays will be sent to the chicken farm, shopping mall, supermarket to realize their value.

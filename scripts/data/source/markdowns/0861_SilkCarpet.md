weaver follows the Talim chart which is a coded colour chart. The chart indicates the number of knots which has to be weaved according to the panned colours. The production follows these following steps:  The silk to be used for carpet weaving goes through following process before designs on carpet are drawn. These are:  Washing and Drying of the yarn- The wool to be used for carpet weaving carries dust, grease which has to be removed and it is done by thoroughly washing and drying in the sun for 2-3 days.  Carding- It is a mechanical process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibres to produce a continuous web. It breaks up locks and unorganized clumps of fiber and then aligns the individual fibers to be parallel with each other. This process ensures that the fiber strands flow smoothly while spinning. This process is also used to blend different wools.  Spinning- The carded wool is spun on a Charkha or the spinning wheel to produce the yarn. The thickness of the yarn depends on the quality of the carpet and usually a 3 ply yarn is used.  Dyeing / Coloring- The dyeing of wool is a delicate process which varies according to the dyestuff used and the color desired.

is accomplished in hot chamber for even dyeing of wools. And then the wools are dried in open space under the sun.  Designing: It’s the first step toward a beautiful and elegant looking carpet. The designer is called nakshakar. The nakshakar expresses his imagination in a hard paper sheet or cloth piece. The weaver will follow the design to weave.  Wraping: Wrapping is orchestrating of the yarn so it runs the long way in weaving. Bent string is utilized for fine and careful weaves and jute is additionally utilized for more unpleasant examples. In twisting activity, all the twists for the floor covering weaving are brought to the thick iron bar and afterward moved to a slight steel bar. At that point it is collapsed and taken to the loom for mounting on the loom and the way toward weaving is completed.  Process of weaving: Before starting the weaving process, a designer draws the design on a white paper and a graph is created. After that, weaver adjusts handloom according to the size of the carpet. Maximum three people work together in a single handloom. First, they bind the warp in cotton yarn, wool yarn, silk yarn horizontally on the handloom then begin to weave the carpet starting from all the way at the bottom in an upward direction towards the top. They make knots (combination of the vertical pile and horizontal pile) and bind together. After creating about ten wefts the weavers work fast. This is call weft. Weft means the upper part of carpet which is made of silk and wool.  Washing: After the weaving process is completed the contractor takes the carpet back again measured in kilogram. Then the carpet is being washed thoroughly to wash out the dusts and extra cotton and wool micro-particles.

 Finishing and packaging: Then the carpet is further subjected to inspection for texture and color evenness of design. After they do some manual adjustment it proceeds for packing and shipping. 5. Project Components: 5.1. Land- The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities weaving, designing and finishing area. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small scale factory setup is 1500-2000Sq. ft. approximately. 5.2. Civil Work- Micro, small and medium enterprises are engaged in this work accounting for the total manufacturing units.  Workshop Area- This area includes the machinery setup and foundation space for all equipments, work floor area, and designing, dyeing, weaving and finishing. Total workshop area is approx. 1200Sqft.  Inventory Area- This area includes the storage space for all the raw materials, tooling and die storage space and finished goods. Total inventory area is approx. 300Sqft.  Office Area – This space includes staff working region, their accommodation space, canteen area, medical facility etc. Total workshop area is approx. 300Sqft. This may be considered above the ground floor.  Parking Space, Electricity Utensils Mounting Space, and Others. This could be approx. 200Sqft.

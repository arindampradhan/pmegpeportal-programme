GRAPHITE CRUCIBLES Introduction: Graphite Crucibles are refractory containers specially shaped for metallurgical operations. These are made of a mixture of Graphite, Refractory Clay, Grog and other additives. These crucibles are termed as clay bonded Graphite crucibles according to the raw materials used. The crucibles are available with or without spout. These crucibles are used for melting ferrous, non-ferrous metals alloys and noble metals. Uses & Market Potential: Graphite Crucibles used in furnaces, direct heating and induction electric furnaces in a vacuum or protective atmosphere at temperatures upto 2500°C. Crucibles are recommended for use with melts of copper, aluminium, zinc, and other metals and their alloys. The main market for the product is foundry industry. With the growing industrial sector the need for specialized metal and alloy castings is increasing day-by-day. With the advent of many multinational automobile industrial units, many auto spare are manufactured in large numbers in Haryana, Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra States. There is a good demand in these States for

Manufacturing Process: The raw materials such as graphite, Refractory/plastic clay, grog and other additives are mixed in a pan mixer after taking proper batch proportions. The wet mass is then kept for ageing. The aged mix is then extruded in a de-airing pugmill and blanks are made. The crucibles are prepared from the blanks either by pressing in a hydraulic press or by jiggering. The shaped crucibles are then dried, glazed and fired in a kiln to develop strength and glaze. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 2500 to 3000Sqft. Power Requirement –The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 40hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is including 1 Supervisor, Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security 9 guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. 2 Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

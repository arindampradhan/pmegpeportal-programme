1. INTRODUCTION Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is a protein- packed spread popular around the world. It’s made of ground peanuts - often roasted first - blended into a thick paste. Natural peanut butter is available at health food stores and specialty grocers, and can be easily found online. Look for a product that contains no additives other than a little salt. Peanuts have considerable nutrients and are consumed in different forms all over the world since long. Peanut butter is one such product consumed in large quantities especially in western countries since many years. It is not very popular in India and the domestic market is dominated by milk butter. Hence, the promoters must target growing export market and should be financially sound. The technology is available indigenously and it is advisable to engage a technical consultant to ensure quality. Peanut butter is served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to make sandwiches.

2. MARKET POTENTIAL: The global peanut butter market reached a value of US$ 3.5 Billion in 2019, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.6% during 2014-2019. Peanuts are an essential crop grown worldwide and are commercially used for the production of oil, butter, flour, confections and snack products. Indian peanuts are popular all over the world with large exports every year. But unfortunately, our market share is primarily confined to raw peanuts and value-added products like blanched & roasted peanuts and peanut butter has very negligible contribution. Peanut Butter Market in India estimated to grow aggressively due to increasing demand from all the states of India. The Indian Peanut Butter Market witnessing 14.2% of CAGR from 2019 to 2025. Delhi is the 1st place for the highest demand of peanut butter in India. After Delhi Punjab — the land of milk, butter and ghee — is witnessing significant changes in people’s eating habits with traditional butter being replaced by peanut butter. This can be gauged from the fact that for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, Punjab is the biggest market for peanut butter after Delhi. Otherwise, Delhi market is followed by Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune for other products in the FMCG segment. 3. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 3.1 PRODUCT BENEFITS & TYPES  Peanut butter is an ideal substitute for milk butter. It is a low calorie, high protein product. Compared to milk butter, its price is very competitive.  Peanut butter is most commonly used in sandwiches and as a spread. It is widely used in bakeries and confectioneries  For women specifically, a study found a 21% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes was associated with consuming peanut butter at least 5 times per week.

 However, peanuts are high in calories and, while they contain “good fats”.  One of the main fats in peanut butter is oleic acid. When substituted for other fats in your diet, oleic acid is shown to help maintain good cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. Managing these levels in your body can lower the risk of heart disease.  Peanut butter is a great substitution or alternative to meat products because it is much less expensive, it’s filling, and it contains fiber. Breakup by Product Type: Smooth Peanut Butter  Crunchy Peanut Butter  Smooth peanut butter is the most preferred product type in the market as it is easier to spread and mixes better with smoothies and desserts. 3.2 Product Nutrition A quarter-cup of peanuts (the approximate amount in a 2 tablespoon serving of peanut butter) contains: Calories: 207  Protein: 9 grams  Fat: 18 grams  Carbohydrates: 6 grams  Fiber: 3 grams  Sugar: 1 gram  Peanut butter is a good source of: Vitamin E  Niacin (B3)  Manganese  Vitamin B6  Magnesium 

Peanut butter is also a good source of copper, a mineral that helps maintain our bone health, immune function, and blood vessels. Some research suggests that getting enough copper in your diet may reduce your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. 3.3 Raw Material Requirement & Sources  Peanuts are the main raw material for manufacturing peanut butter: Cost per Kg is approx. Rs.80-85. Peanuts are a nutritious, hunger-satisfying, low-glycemic snack. Groundnuts in India are available throughout the year due to a two- crop cycle harvested in March and October. Ground Nuts are important protein crops in India grown mostly under rain-fed conditions. The awareness and concern for quality amongst the Indian groundnut shellers and processors are growing steadily.  Other raw material required except peanut are as follows: 1. Honey: Cost per KG is Rs.250-280 2. Jaggery: Cost per KG is Rs.50 Average raw material cost of Per KG Peanut Butter is approx. Rs. 300-320. 3.4 Machine Description 1. Peanut Roaster: The machine mainly process food: legume, kernels, nut (e.g. various kinds of peanut kernels, melon seeds, almond, chestnut, horsebean) etc.

5. Peanut butter filling machine: The peanut butter filling machine is an ideal equipment for filling high viscosity fluid and paste. 3.5 MANUFACTURING PROCESS It is possible to buy raw peanuts instead of shelled peanuts or peanut pods. But it is advisable to install groundnut shelling plant to ensure quality of the all-important input which determines the ultimate quality of butter. The manufacturing process in this project is briefly described hereunder:  Peanut Grading: Procurement of raw material & Peanuts are graded according to sizes to ensure only big or bold peanuts are taken up for process.  Peanut Roasting & Blanching: This is a critical stage. Roasting is done at around 160O C for 40-60 minutes depending upon the moisture contents. Roasting reduces water contents to around 1% which increases the shelf life of peanuts and helps develop flavor. After roasting, peanuts are cooled and then blanched (removal of outer red skin). After blanching each peanut is inspected to remove discolored (grey or black) nuts.  Grinding Peanuts are then ground in peanut butter mill in two stages to produce fine and creamy butter. The outlet temperature is around 65-75OC. All ingredients like salt, sugar and stabilizers are added during this process  De-aeration Air is incorporated into peanut butter during milling and subsequently it is removed in a vacuum.  Cooling a scraped surface heat exchanger is used for cooling. The outlet temperature depends upon the type of stabiliser used.

 Filling and Packing Peanut butter is filled in Pet Jars or metal drums as per the instructions of the buyer. Immediately after filling, the jars are vibrated to remove any remaining air bubbles. After keeping jars or drums for around 35-40 hours at around 20OC, the peanut butter sets completely and can be dispatched. Recovery from groundnut shells or pods is 55% HPS groundnuts, 22% husk and balance 23% are splits or kapchi. Roasting of peanuts and removal of discoloured peanuts, results in further waste/loss of 5%  Checking of final product, packaging & sent for sale. PEANUT BUTTER MANUFACTURING FLOW CHART 4. PROJECT COMPONENTS 4.1 Land Land required 1000-1200 square feet approx. Approximate rent for the same is Rs.20000-24000 per month.

This mean the demand of phenyl is exists in all area. PRODUCTION TARGETS Basis of estimation: 300 Working Days in a Year Single Shift basis 8 hours per shift Phenyl Quantity (Liters) 1,50000 MANUFACTURING PROCESS Firstly take 100 gram Rosin and 100 gram Caster Oil in a container, warm it gently. Similarly in another container take 66 gram Na OH (Caustic Soda) and dissolve it in 200 ml of distilled water. Now caustic soda is tickle down into warm mixture of Rosin and Linseed oil by stirring gently. It would take15-20 minutes. Now stand for 45 minutes and maintain the temperature of o solution at 80-90 C. Now add with constant stirring, 300 gram creosote oil and 20 gram Monochloro phenol into warm mix of Rosin, Linseed Oil and Caustic Soda. Now add o desired quantity of distilled water and warm the mixture with stirring upto 90-100 C for minutes. Cool the mixture and it is ready for packing. Different Raw Materials required for different Grades of Phenyl. General composition Hospital grade phenyl is 1. given below: 2. Rosin – 2.50 Kg 3. Groundnut Oil – 2 Kg Caustic Soda – 250 gram

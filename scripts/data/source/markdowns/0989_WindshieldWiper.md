WINDSHIELD WIPER MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A vehicle's wiper system is an integrated system for removing rain, snow, ice, and debris from the glass or windshield. It has a significant impact on visibility and the safety of passengers and the vehicle. It is a legal necessity in every automobile. It's in nearly every vehicle, including cars, trucks, railroad engines, and cabin-equipped boats. Pivot - left or right-hand drive, sequential sweep, single blade arm, mono blade, pantograph system, and twin windscreen wiper arms are some of the types of wipers used in automobiles. The functioning of almost all present wiper mechanisms is powered by an electric motor. Pneumatic drives are also utilized to drive wiper arms in some situations.

Uses & Market Potential: The following are the uses of the windshield wiper system: 1. The wiper cleans the front and rear windshields of the vehicle 2. Removal of water and snow 3. Removal of dirt According to a recent research released by various researchers, the worldwide Automotive Windshield Wiper Systems market was valued at 7228.18 million USD in 2020 and would expand at a CAGR of 4.26 percent from 2020 to 2027. Automobile manufacturing is projected to increase, propelling the sector forward. Furthermore, the growing need for rear wiper systems in the low-end automobile market is driving up demand for these goods. Rain- sensing wiper systems are expected to boost industry development because they improve vehicle safety by eliminating driver distraction caused by manual wiper activation during inclement weather. Over the projected period, the launch of these goods is likely to significantly boost industry growth. Because of the existence of important automotive component manufacturers like as Robert Bosch Gmb H and Trico, regions such as North America and Europe are contributing to the industry's growth. Blades, couplings, and motors are among the goods offered by the firms. Product: Windshield Wiper Raw Material: Basic raw material is Wiper Blade, Galvanized Steel, Pivot socket, spring steel sheet, two end ferrules and rubber strip.

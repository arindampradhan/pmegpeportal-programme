INTRAVENEOUS STANDS Introduction: Intravenous therapy (IV) is therapy that delivers fluids directly into a vein. The intravenous route of administration can be used both for injections, using a syringe at higher pressures; as well as for infusions, typically using only the pressure supplied by gravity. Intravenous infusions are commonly referred to as drips. The intravenous route is the fastest way to deliver medications and fluid replacement throughout the body, because they are introduced directly into the circulation. Intravenous therapy may be used for fluid volume replacement, to correct electrolyte imbalances, to deliver medications, and for blood transfusions and IV STANDS may act as media for INTRAVENEOUS Therapy. Uses & Market Potential: IV poles and stands are a familiar item to see in any medical facility, particularly a hospital. IV poles, or intravenous poles, provide patients with a continuous supply of fluids and medicine. Wide range of IV Stands are required in the medical industry and become the essential need of hospitals and Nursing homes in today’s era. Today, various types of IV Stands are available for basic medical requirements as well as specialized procedures. The most important function of the IV Stand is to treat the patient

during medical emergency. The largest segment in the total IV Stand is general that can get fix on patient bed and some of them are two Pipe (adjustable height) with stand and multiple hooks and which cost almost two times of and ordinary IV Stand , as for providing comfort to the patients the demand of this product is increasing day by day and there is good scope of IV Stand manufacturing industry as the demand of the improved technology stretchers is expected to increase in the future. The IV Poles market studied was projected to register a CAGR of about 6.3% over the forecast period. The major factor attributing to the growth of the market is the increase in the prevalence of diseases such as gastrointestinal diseases, neurological diseases, cancer where IV fluids are given to the patients. Raw Material: Major raw material requirements are as follows: 1. M. S. Pipe 2. Stainless steel pipe 202 Grade 3. Wheel Set Machinery & Equipments: Major machineries & equipments are as follows: S No. Machine Unit Price 1. Sensitive Drilling Machine. 2 40000 2. Arc Welding set (with lead) 1 25000 3.

Manufacturing Process: The process of manufacturing of IV Stands does not involve any special technology. It is basically manufactured by sheet metal operation basically fabrication work which involve bending and cutting of Pipes and pressing of hooks. The Pipes MS/SS are cut as per drawing specifications by Pipe cutters and then the hooks are pressed by mechanical presses and sometimes it is manufactured as integral part or sometimes it is manufactured as detachable attachment. It is purely in accordance with the type of application and customer satisfaction, then the holes are drilled in the pipes so as to make it available of adjustable heights. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs 4 Lac. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Machine operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11%

PLASTIC SPOONS Introduction: The plastic spoons are used in food and beverages industry. Plastic spoons are the part of dining cutlery in various occasions. Most of the packaged food industry concentrates on these cutleries to attract customer. Small spoons are often used for desserts, or to stir sugar into coffee or tea. There might be an expectation that food tasted from a small spoon would normally be sweeter than food tasted from a larger tablespoon. Recent advancement in plastic industry could lead the use of biodegradable plastic use in manufacturing of food grade cutlery. Although it slightly enhance the overall product cost; could help to save the environment from dangerous aspects of the single use of these products. The products are manufactured using polypropylene, polystyrene, bio-degradable plastic resins. In this report the manufacturing of plastic spoons are explained using injection moulding process with polypropylene pellets. The project cost may vary due to change in raw material and processes. Uses & Market Potential: The global market for plastic spoons is segmented into applications and product type. Commercial and household are the main segments of the applications in the plastic spoon market. They are currently used across a number of different industries such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, cosmetic products, household goods,

etc. The global spoon market is driven by the increasing demand for convenience packaging in the food industry. Spoons are used in packaging that involves the inclusion of a spoon in the packaging of food products. The concept of spoon in lid packaging has gained popularity across the globe owing to the increasing out-of-home consumption of food products. Spoons are used in packaging that involves the inclusion of a spoon in the packaging of food products. The idea of using spoon in cover packaging has gained attractiveness across the globe owing to the increasing out-of-home consumption of food products. Frozen food market, Fast Food Restaurants are extensively using plastic spoons for better customer experiences. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Polypropylene Pellets 2. Plasticizers 3. Packing material Machinery requirement: Major machinery and equipments are as follows: Description Quantity Rate Value Injection Molding machine 1 1250000 1250000 Grinder 1 65000 65000 Water Chiller 1 25000 25000 Other equipments & hand tools Ls 100000 Total Amount 1440000 Manufacturing Process: Plastics spoons are manufactured using injection moulding machine. The raw material for this is food grade polypropylene pellets that are procured from the local authorized vendor and stored in the inventory. The pellets are dried before starting the manufacturing process to avoid the formation of blow holes. For this pellets are heated to a temperature of 110°C and dried off. In the next step, the profile dies of desired dimension of caps or spoons in individual machines or shift wise into the machine. The barrel heaters are

started and brought up to the desired temperature range of the melting point of PP pellets. After this, the PP pellets are poured into the hopper of the machine manually. Plasticizers are added to enhance the plastic flow properties. The machine used in injection moulding machine with horizontal axis screw. The PP pellets are fed into the feed section of the screw where the pellets gets heated and melted down. Thermocouples are mounted on the on the barrel for the precise measuring of temperature. The PP pellets are injected into the dies at suitable back pressure. This back pressure is adjusted with PLC controlled hydraulic valves. This back pressure is maintained till the PP molten plastic is filled inside in the cavity of the die. When the mould is filled the die is cooled using water flow inside the cavity of the die to extract the heat of the mould. This heated water is cooled down using water chillers and the water is circulated for the cooling cycle. The plastic product gets solidified. The cooling cycle is maintained by using PLC programmed control units. In the next step, the ejector pins separate the solidified parts outside the machine. The non-uniform pieces are crushed within the grinder and reuse as pellets into the machine. The solidified caps and spoons are collected into the bins. This solidified spoons and caps are packed in required quantity and dispatched. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1

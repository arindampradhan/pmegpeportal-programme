PAINT MANUFACTURING Introduction: Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, colour, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colours—and in many different types, such as water colour or synthetic. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each have distinct characteristics. Based on their formulation, industrial paints and coatings can be segmented into four categories: water-based, solvent-based, powder, and UV-based. Uses & Market Potential: Paint is used to protect all sorts of buildings and structures from the effects of water and sun. Wooden buildings such as houses are usually painted because a coat of paint prevents water seeping into the wood and making it rot. The paint also helps to prevent the wood from drying out in the hot sun. Some important uses are as follow:  Paint is used to protect building from different types of weather.

 It is used to decorate all types of objects.  It is also used for art & craft activities.  To improve the beauty of material.  Helps to make material long lasting.  Helps in facilitation of cleaning process of surface. The Indian paint industry has been witnessing a gradual shift in the preferences of people from the traditional whitewash to high quality paints like emulsions and enamel paints, which is providing the basic stability for growth of Indian paint industry. The market for India paints and coatings is expected to expand at a CAGR of 8.56% during the forecast period of 2019 – 2024. Growing demand from the construction industry, coupled with rising infrastructure activities, is driving the demand for the market studied. Raw materials: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Minerals 2. Chemicals 3. Binders 4. Preservatives 5. Wetting Agents 6. Pigments On an average raw material cost per Kg is approx. Rs. 50-55. Value of raw material changes as per the quality.

High speed Single shaft stirrer(200 Kg per hr.) 1 50000 3. Demineralize treatment plant 1 200000 4. Machinery Cooling plant 1 200000 5. Water dispenser 1 100000 6. Other machines & equipments Ls 50000 Total Amount 1300000 Manufacturing Process: Paint is mixture of several chemical compounds like Solvent (usually water), Binder, Plasticizers, Fillers and other additives. In most setting a water treatment plant is used to ensure water’s physical parameters so as to maintain the quality of paint. The water from appropriate water source is inducted into the water treatment plant which basically consists of filtration array which is essentially a sediment filter setting and a reverse osmosis unit which reduces hardness of water. The various reagents [Binder(Oils+Resins), Pigments, Fillers and Additives except Drier] to from base paint are supplied to mixer from various reagent tanks, these reagents are weighed one by one in weighing tank which is an integral part of weighing machine and inducted into the operating mixer. The solid reagents are introduced into the weighing tank via Hooper and Feeder arrangement prior to their induction into the mixer. The resultant base paint is then poured into a holding tank which supplies it to Paint Milling Machine which essentially crushes any coagulated solids and crumbs, so as to maintain the viscosity and quality of paint. This milled paint is held in another holding tank from where it’s supplied to another mixer with appropriate stirrer arrangement, initially soft water is introduced followed by which milled paint, thinner and other reagents are introduced into mixing tank one by one. The resultant paint is then held in a screening tank which is essentially used to separate sludge from paint, this

paint is then supplied to the filling machine which fills this paint into bottles. The paint filled bottles or cans are then capped and sent to labelling machine which labels these bottles followed by which they are sent for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work will cost Rs 3 Lac. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp Manpower Requirement– There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 8 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 1 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

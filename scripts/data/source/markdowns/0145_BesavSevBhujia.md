1. INTRODUCTION Namkeen is the Hindi word used to describe a savory flavor. The word namkeen is derived from the word namak (meaning salt). It is also used as a generic term to describe savory snack foods. Namkeen is pronounced "num-keen," and can also be referred to as numkeen, namkin, and numkin depending on where you travel throughout India and who you speak to. Typical namkeen snacks in Indian cuisine include khaara, farsan, chivda, sav, chips, fried dals, grains and bhujiya. Namkeen of Indore and ratlam are two snacks that are very well known for their tastes. There are a few other Indian snacks that incorporate salt and have a namkeen flavor, some of which are made from basic grains and can be flavored in a multitude of ways. These kinds are therefore similar to each other but have different names. Many of the namkeen snacks include sev, a versatile crunchy snack that can be flavored with all sorts of spices. Sev looks similar to the Chinese hard noodles served in American Chinese food. Sev is a popular Indian snack food consisting of small pieces of crunchy noodles made from chickpea flour paste, which are seasoned with turmeric, cayenne, and ajwain before being deep- fried in oil. These noodles vary in thickness. Ready-to-eat varieties of sev, including flavoured sev, are available in Indian stores.

Sev is eaten as a standalone snack as well as a topping on dishes like bhelpuri and sevpuri.[citation needed] Sev can be made at home and stored for weeks in airtight containers. The snack is popular in Madhya Pradesh, especially in the cities of Indore, Ujjain and Ratlam, where many snack foods consist of sev as a main ingredient. In Madhya Pradesh, sev is used as a side ingredient in almost every chaat snack food, especially ratlami sev, which is made from cloves and chickpea flour. Many varieties of sev are sold commercially, such as long (clove) sev, tomato sev, palak sev, plain sev, and bhujia. In the UK, popular varieties of sev mixed with nuts, lentils and pulses are commonly sold as 'Bombay mix'. 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT TYPES 1.

Each has its own unique composition and taste. A vast variety of kneader class machine are available to suit various capacity and kneading requirements. The next task is namkeen extrusion for which namkeen extruders are used, Namkeen Extruder machine is useful for extruding gram flour, spices dough (besan) into various shapes. However in this case it’s used to extrude dough in shape of shev. The machine is fitted over fryer or namkeen frying machine. The extruded product lands into the frying tank and then is simply fried. The shapes of the products can be altered by using dies of different sizes and shapes. After frying these shevs or bhujiyas are passed through de-oiling machine which simply removes all excess oil from the namkeen. Thus various shevs and bhujiyas are ready afer this step for seasoning. These de-oiled shevs or bhujiyas are fed to seasoning machine which

utilizes its tumbler arrangement to uniformly season these shevs or bhujiyas with salt and spices as per end product. Finally the namkeen is then weighed, filled in packets and sealed in order to make it ready for sale and dispatch though automatic filling and packaging machines are utilized by large scale manufacturers to maintain high production rate with automation. Note: In fully automatic plant sev is transferred in between non-aligned machines using food grade conveyor while in semi-automatic plants its done manually. 3. PROJECT COMPONENTS 3.1 Land /Civil Work The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or processing area, space for power supply utilities, packaging area. Also, some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete small-scale factory setup is 1500-2000 Sq. ft. approximately. Micro, small and medium enterprises are engaged in this work accounting for the total Processing units. We have not considered the cost of Land purchase & Building Civil work in the project. It is assumed that land & building will be on rent & approx. rental of the same will be Rs.20,000- 30,000 per month. 3.2 Plant & Machinery The process involved are Sifting, Kneading, Extrusion, Frying, De-Oiling, Seasoning & Nitrogen Flush Packaging, thus machines required are as follows: 1. Flour Sifter:

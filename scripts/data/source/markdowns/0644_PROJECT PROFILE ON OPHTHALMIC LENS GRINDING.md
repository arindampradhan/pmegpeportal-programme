KVIC - PMEGP PROJECT PROFILE ON OPHTHALMIC LENS GRINDING Introduction : Ophthalmic lenses are manufactured out of ophthalmic rough glass blanks . There are different types of ophthaimic lenses such as purely spherical, cylindrical bifocal and fused bifocal as well as sunglasses etc. These spectacle lenses serve as an aid to precious humaneyes for better and comfortable vision. They protect and restore the normal eyesight of persons. Sunglasses are used for protect of eyes against glare, second wind and also become a fashion wear. Fused bifocal lens serve dual purpose i.e. for distance and near vision in in one spectacle and thus convenient to wear. Fused bifocal lenses are not only scientifically perfect in having spherical center with reading segment but also advantageous to cut and fit into different shapes and sizes of spectacle frames. 1 Name of the Product : OPHTHALMIC LENS GRINDING 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Work shed in sq.ft rented 0 Rs. - Equipment : Rs. 100,000.00 Two spindle semi-automatic cylindrical lens grinding and polishing machine with motor.

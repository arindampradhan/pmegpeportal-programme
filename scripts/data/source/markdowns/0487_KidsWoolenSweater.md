KIDS WOOLEN SWEATER Introduction: A sweater, also called a jumper in British English is a piece of clothing, typically with long sleeves, made of knitted or crocheted material that covers the upper part of the body. When sleeveless, the garment is often called a slipover. Sweaters are worn by adults and children of all genders, often over a shirt, blouse, T-shirt, or other top, but sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from wool but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibres, or any combination of these. A sweater is a piece of clothing worn on the upper body to keep the person warm. Sweaters are usually knitted or crocheted. Other names for sweaters are pullover, jersey, or jumper. Sweaters that open in the front are often called cardigans.

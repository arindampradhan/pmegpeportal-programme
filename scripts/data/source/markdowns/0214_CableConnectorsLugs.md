PROJECT PROFILE ON CABLE SOCKET (LUGS) INTRODUCTION Cable lugs are the devices used for connecting cable and wire conductors in electrical installations and equipment. These are used when permanent, direct fastening methods are not feasible or necessary. In general, lugs are fixed to cables and wires by inserting the conductor/s into the barrel (tube) of the device and then barrel is crimped, soldered or welded onto the conductor for secure mechanical and electrical joint. The connection end of the lug is then fastened to connection point by means of a bolt, screw, or spring clip. Numerous sizes, configurations and material types are available to suit particular applications. The connector end of a cable lug is typically chosen for its compatibility to the terminal type or anchoring method. Fork or U-shaped lugs are used for screw terminals; closed-ring or O-type lugs are used for bolt-on applications; and pin or spade lugs are used for press-on pin or blade terminals. A cable lug also serves as a cable- size reducer, thereby allowing thick cables to be attached to a connector with a smaller diameter. Cable lugs, also referred to as Cable terminal ends or cable shoes are electrical supplies utilized to securely connect or terminate cables to electrical devices, power or 2

control panels, junction boxes, equipments and machineries. These lugs are often used to join power cables together as well. Cable Lugs intended to ensure the safety of both the appliances and human beings. These lugs can be uniquely engineered according to the client’s preferences and requirements. MARKET POTENTIAL Cable Sockets and Thimbles are very common item and it used in every place wherever Electric supply exists. With rapid industrialization and electrification the demand for this item is every increasing. It is used by Electricity Board. Industries of all type in installation of plant and machinery and by Electrical Power Equipment manufacturing units. The demand for this item is unlimited. BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS 1. The basis for calculation of production capacity is on single shift basis, working of 25 days per month on 60 % efficiency. The required for achieving envisaged capacity utilization is assumed as five years. 2. BEP for the scheme has been calculated on full capacity utilization. 3. Rate of interest has been taken as 11.5% on an average. This, however, is likely to vary . 4. Labour wages have been taken on the basis of minimum applicable. There are likely to change depending upon the location of the project. 5. Term of loan differs from one financial institution to another and in general minimum gestation period is normally 6 months Maximum period for repayment of loan is 5 years including gestation period. The entrepreneurs from the concerned financial institutions may find the exact terms and conditions. 6. The cost of machinery and equipments as indicated in the scheme are approximate those ruling at the time of preparation of the scheme. The entrepreneur may check the exact price for specific make and model of the machine selected. 7. Non-refundable deposits, cost of preparation of project report etc. may be considered under preoperative expenses. 3

8. The provision made in other respects viz; raw materials, utilities, overheads etc. are drawn on the basis of standard variation and output. The cost indicated against each is approximate and based on local market condition and observations. The entrepreneur may find out the exact cost from the concerned sources. 9. The operative period of this project is estimated to be about 10 years considering technology obsolesce IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: It is estimated that from the conception of the project to commercial production, it may take about two years including purchase of machineries, erection & installation, recruitment of staff and all clearance from different agencies like DIC, financial institutions/banks etc. TECHNICAL ASPECTS: PROCESS OUTLINE: Copper pipes of required size and outer diameter are cut to the size and then pressed in power press with the help of relevant set of dies. Afterwards it is machined and internal threads are made. Now the final finish to product is given and sent for electroplating and buffing. Afterwards the product is sent for physical verification and testing and then to packing. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDS The relevant IS specification for Cable Socket (Lugs) is IS:8309 – 1993 Reaffirmed 2008. 4

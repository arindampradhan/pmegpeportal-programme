1. INTRODUCTION Beans are members of the legume family, plants that produce pods with seeds inside. They’re a staple food in some cultures and an important source of plant-based protein and other essential nutrients, such as iron and folate. Canning is a method of preserving foods for long periods by packing them in airtight containers. Beans are partially cooked and canned under high heat and pressure. Canned beans are a versatile processed food and offer a nutritional profile similar to that of dried beans. They are an excellent source of fiber, plant-based protein, and other essential nutrients, such as folate and potassium. They're reliable, cheap, and nonperishable, and they also play nicely with a multitude of other ingredients, including vegetables, rice, fish, and meat. Despite the potential for contamination, canned beans are generally safe to consume and prove to be a convenient and nutritious alternative to dried beans. Dried beans can take a long time to soak and cook (sometimes, you have to plan a day or two ahead). Unsurprisingly, many end up taking the familiar and low-cost shortcut of using canned beans instead.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PRODUCT USES Baked beans are used as a convenience food. They may be eaten hot or cold, and straight from the can, as they are fully cooked. Baked beans are served alongside barbecue foods and at picnics. Baked beans are used in salads or culinary dishes. Consumption of baked beans was found to lower cholesterol levels a good source of vegetable protein. Nutritional value includes vegetable protein, low fat and fiber. 2.2 PRODUCT RAW MATERIAL  Beans: The unit’s primary raw material is beans. High-quality beans can be procured. Most vendors use haricot beans for baked beans production.

 Other: Tomato puree, Starch, Salt, sugar, Spices, artificial flavourings, additives, and preservatives. Packing materials. Steel tins or cans are used as a packing material. 2.3 MANUFACTURING PROCESS This process can be broken down into the following steps-  Raw material procurement  Baked beans production process  Testing Raw Material Procurement The raw materials are checked strictly as per established quality standards and requirements. Individual supplier assessment and supplier rating are done depending upon the rejection levels at the incoming quality control stage. Sorting of raw material will be done as per material type or specifications. The material will be stored in; a dust-free, moisture-free, cool, neat, and clean environment. Powder Making Process 1. Bean Conditioning: The conditioning process is there to remove broken beans, off- colored beans, stones, and other foreign material. Uniformity in the beans helps in further processing and allows them to soak up water before being steamed. Conditioning is done using different methods that include sieves, sifters, color sorters,

destoners, and gravity separators. This process can be optional if high quality beans are procured. 2. Re-hydration: The dried beans are first rehydrated with hot water. The process starts with beans loaded into a blancher goes through conveyor then rehydrated with water. They are then introduced to 85-degree chamber then soaking for 10 minutes. The steam blancher softens the dry beans then rehydration in warm water to remove excess skin. This process simultaneously kills any microorganisms on the surface of the beans. 3. Ingredient Mixing: Discolored beans are removed through a laser air jet system before addition of ingredients. Ingredients added are tomato puree, starch to thicken, vinegar spices. They are then treated with any food additives, including salt, and canned under high pressure and heat. 4. Blending: The mixture is blended for 15 minutes before steaming and canning. 5. Filling & Steaming: It will be kept in steamer about 2 hours for baking beans. The blended mixture is then filled by fillers in cans or tan and sealed and a long bout in the super-steamy pressure cookers, between 90 minutes and five hours, depending on the flavor. That last step prevents bacteria from getting into the can. 6. Cooling: Later, cans are given time to cool. They’re labeled and organized on a conveyor belt and sent down to the warehouse. Testing Quality control

COMPUTER BUSINESS CENTRE 1. INTRODUCTION A computer business centre is a place where services like word processing, data processing, accounting, fax facilities, internet café, photocopying, lamination, typing, scanning, binding, online registrations, digital passports, instant photo printing. With best location, this business can fetch revenues and profit. Students and small business owners can be regular customers who seek one or other service at centre. 2. SERVICE AND ITS APPLICATION As already mention above, computer business centre with technical support and skills can be important and critical facilities provider. Preparing project materials, binding reports, data entries for small businesses, fax/scan & email, seeking certain online services like passport application, driving licence application, other govt/non govt applications etc. are some of particular services which can be provided by computer business centre. 3. INDUSTRY LOOK OUT AND TRENDS The personal computer industry has had a global production network almost from its inception. In a rush to catch up with Apple in the early 1980s, IBM decided to standardize the basic components of the PC so they could be assembled in a modular fashion. IBM Then outsources most of those components to other suppliers. The common standards, modular design, and simple assembly of the PC made it possible to disaggregate the production process among the various components, outsource production and even assembly, and locate that work anywhere in the world. Some of the components for the original IBM PC came from Asian suppliers. Other components also began to be produced overseas, as IBM and other PC makers began locating their assembly operations overseas to gain access to foreign markets, and as their suppliers moved their operations abroad to reduce production costs.

4. MARKET POTANTAIL AND MARKETING ISSUES. IF ANY Emerging technology makes new tools and services more affordable and allows companies to save on their staff payroll and office equipment. Because computers allow work to be done faster and more efficiently, it is possible for a company to hire fewer staff. In addition, with networked and relatively inexpensive computers, companies can store data more easily, saving on the cost of outside file storage, and can avoid having to purchase as many copiers, fax machines, typewriters, and other such items that were used before computers became popular. Correspondingly, potentially profitable businesses can be started with a smaller overhead cost. Email capabilities decrease postage costs; software applications reduce the need for large accounting departments, while videoconferencing reduces the need for travel. All resources saved will trickle down to the consumers, who are then provided with much more affordable products and service. Computers help speed up other business operations. The collecting of consumer feedback, ordering of raw materials, and inspection of products is made quicker through the use of computers, allowing companies to operate much faster and to produce better quality results. 5. RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENT 1. Computers, Advanced Software & 2. Colour Printers, Photocopiers, Technologies Scanners 3. Office Furniture 4. Spiral Binding machine 5. Paper cutter 6. Laminating Machine 7. Air Conditioner 8. UPS/Inverter 6. SERVICE PROCESS OUTLINE Setup of a computer business centre requires below steps to follow. 1.

2. Decide on Services to be offered.  Next thing is to decide list of services which can be offered to customers based on fixed capital investment and skills possessed. 3. Fixed Investment  Preparing a required machines/items list from list of services which will be offered. Suppliers for these items needs to be decided based on technical and commercial offers and budget of an entrepreneur. 4. Advertising and Social Media marketing  This is very crucial, as this centre cannot be easily seen/accessible to everyone near the place. Plus, there must be special packages for small business owners like accounting, data processing, tax returns preparation and that must be properly communicated to nearby business owners. For college going students, there must be various packages which offers spiral binding, project report preparation, binding, laminating, scanning/photocopying and most importantly that must be in-line with what college authority demands. 7.

KVIC- REGP-Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana Project Profile on Soya Sauce Introduction : Soya bean is a leguminous crop and is rich in proteins. Many value-added products are made from it like milk, panner, cheese and sauce. Soya products are increasingly becoming popular especially amongst health-conscious people. Soya sauce is used as a taste enhancer as it has a typical bitter-sour and sweet taste as well as flavour. The preferred locations are Gujarat,MP,Mahashtra etc. But this note considers Maharashtra as the prospective location since market for the soy a sauce is consistently increasing in the State. Amravati district of Maharashtra cultivates substantial quantities of Soya beans with around 30,000 hectare area under this crop. Therefore location of the proposed plant has to be selected carefully. Process of Manufacture:The manufacturing process is simple. De-fatted soya flour is processed by using hydrolysis process. Flour and water alongwith other ingredients like salt, baking soda, vinegar, preservatives etc. are maked homogenously to form a semi-liquid or paste-type mixture and it is passed through filter sieves to remove impurities. This mixture is then taken to SS neutralisation tanks and kept for about 2 hours before packing. 1 Name of the Product : Soya Sauce 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Worksheds iqn. msqtr.fst 150 Rs. 180,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 155,000.00 SS tanks with filer sieves of 100 ltrs.capacity-2,SS Collection and neutralisation tanks of 50 ltrs.-capacity-4,Bottle Washing and Filling Machine-1, Weighing Scales-2.

MOUSE PAD MANUFACTURING UNIT Introduction: A mousepad is a flat surface on which a computer mouse may be positioned and moved. By providing a surface for the mouse to monitor movement precisely and without jitter, a mousepad improves its usefulness as compared to using a mouse directly on a table. Although the benefits of a cushioned wrist rest on some mousepads are disputed, they do improve ergonomics. Higher speed, better precision, and user comfort were the three most major advantages of the mousepad's debut. A side benefit was that constant hand and mouse rubbing motions did not damage or wear the tabletop or table surface. Another advantage was that the accumulation of dirt under the mouse was minimized, resulting in less jitter of the pointer on the display. Computer mouse is intended to move the pointer around the screen in an easy and smooth manner, but a mouse pad makes this operation considerably more efficient. While the mouse can operate without a pad, it is recommended that you use one to keep the mouse's sensors clean and free of potentially harmful dust and debris.

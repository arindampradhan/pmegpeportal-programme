# 0339 Project Profile On Electronic Weighing Scales

## Page 1

"KVIC- REGP-(Gramodyog Rojgar Yojana)" Project Profile on Electronic Weighing Scales Introduction : Used in industries and commercial establishments for weighing and segregating raw materials and finished goods for process and sale, electronic systems score over their analog counterpart in many ways. Accuracy, compactness, flexibility and high speed response are some of the advantages. Electronic weighting systems basically comprise to load cell, signal conditioner and the output device/display. This product would require a well established marketing set-up and post-sales service network, but there is constant and growing demand for the product. Raw materials required for Electronic Weighin scales are Strain guage (load cell), ICs, diodes, resistors, capacitors and transistors, LCD/LED display device, coils & transformers, switches, PCB, cables and wires, mechanical sub-system etc. Process :The electronic assembly consists of IC's display device and other electronic components being assembled on the PCB as per the design and weighing capacity. Then this is integrated with the electro-mechanical subassembly and housed in the casing. 1 Name of the Product : Electronic Weighing Scales 2 Project Cost : a Capital Expenditure Land : Own Workshed in sq.ft On rent Rs. 24,000.00 Equipment : Rs. 130,000.00 Bench drilling machine, Portable grinder, Load cell simulator, General purpose oscilloscope, Digital multimeters, Standard weights, True RMS multimeter, LCR Meter, IC Tester.

1. INTRODUCTION Rabri (IAST: Rabaḍī) is a sweet, condensed-milk-based dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made by boiling milk on low heat for a long time until it becomes dense and changes its colour to off-white or pale yellow. Rabri is made by heating sweetened milk in a large open vessel (kadhai). As the layer of cream begins to form on the surface of the milk, it is taken off and kept aside. Rabri is consumed in all parts of India and is consumed by all age groups. Yield of rabri depends on total solids of milk, ratio of concentration of milk and amount of sugar added. 2. MARKET POTENTIAL: Rabri and other sweet products made of milk are consumed everywhere in India. The demand of this product is in rural as well as in urban areas. India is known for its festive and religious occasions throughout the year and the demand of milk products is never ending in India’s market. The Indian sweet and candy market is currently valued

CARPET MANUFACTURING UNIT  2. Introduction: Beautifying one’s house has been an ancient tradition since ages; the wealthy do it with costly materials while the lower pay family units to brighten their homes in their own imaginative manners. Floor covering weaving keeps on being a wellspring of work for some craftsmans in India.

Restricting a rug shields the edges of your floor covering from fraying and self- destructing over the long run. There are two or three choices accessible to finish this coupling cycle. This should be possible with a little, convenient machine that rides along the floor on wheels. The nature of these mats relies upon various components, for example, the bunch check, colors utilized and nature of the yarns. To have customary flooding done on a mat or covering is extravagant, and can require a long time to finish. For this to be done effectively the floor covering should be requested wrapping up. It works a similar way conventional polyester restricting tape does however offers the more refined look of flooding. Ideal for the closures of that new sprinter, or at whatever point you need a more work of art, cleaned look. Conventional bordering is sewn into the closures of an oriental carpet when it's woven at the factory. It's an exemplary look that is anticipated from most conventional oriental mats and sprinters. 3. Market Potential: The Carpet weaving had been begun route long back in sixteenth century in Mughal period. In current situation India is the biggest maker and exporter of floor covering on the planet in term of both volume and worth. Around 80% of rug made in India are exported. India is popular in

worldwide market for its superb plan particularly Persian plan. India has pioneered as largest exporter of handmade carpets. Known as the ‘Carpet City’, the Mirzapur-Bhadohi locale is the biggest carefully assembled cover weaving bunch, drawing in around 3.2 million individuals in the business. A significant piece of expressions and handiworks, this calling keeps on being well known in the locale of Uttar Pradesh, where the significant focuses of creation are Bhadohi, Sonbhadra, Mirzapur and Japunpur.

Famous carpet types from Bhadohi include cotton Dhurry/Dhurries, Chhapra Mir carpets, Loribaft, Indo Gabbeh but also Nepalese carpets and more recent shaggy type carpets. They are manufactured in various qualities. The popularity of the Bhadohi carpets led to the formation of the All India Carpet Manufacturers Association (AICMA) in the year 1985 by manufacturing and export firms for promotion of exports and handling of buyers who play with price by quoting lower price of competitors. The domestic market size is about Rs 200 crores. Many Industry players think that Indian market will expand rapidly based on current retail boom. Over the years carpet weaving center has emerged across India. Each has its own distinct competitiveness. These centers employ millions of people.

4. Product Description: 4.1. Product Uses- For longevity, it is prescribed to utilize customary, sewn-on official on the floor coverings. There are a few varieties of the tape that is sewn on and offers numerous alternatives for a consummately redone look. 4.2. Raw Material-  Dyes and Chemicals: Colors utilized for the coloring of fleece additionally shapes one of the significant crude materials.  Woven Rugs (Comprised of various strings.)  Chemicals utilized in synthetic and mechanical completing are provided through vendors and merchants working in the group.  Carpet binding tape  Hot glue Average raw material cost of Finished Carpet per sqft. will be Rs. 35- 50 (Approx.) 4.3. Manufacturing Process: "Finishing Stage". Here the carpets are given finishing & detailing is taken care of:  The finishes are given to them and the different applications they are put to. When it comes to carpet manufacturing, different techniques are adopted. Once the yarn is woven into a rug, there are few steps in the final processing of the rugs.  Carpet edges: The most common choices for carpet finishing are binding, serging, and fringing.  Binding is typically the easiest and least-expensive method of finishing a carpet edge. Binding the edge of a carpet involves wrapping a strip of fabric—which is generally made from either

polyester or cotton—around the edge of the carpet and stitching it in place. This is done by a carpet-binding machine.  Serging the edge of the carpet pieces produces a look that seems hand-sewn, although it is most often done by machine. Serging is also called over lock stitching, and it is done with a special machine designed for the purpose. Serging is almost always more expensive than binding.  Fringing is a common and somewhat iconic finishing treatment for area rugs. In hand-knotted rugs, the fringe is necessary, as it is the edge of the “backbone” fibers of the rug. On machine-made rugs, however, fringe is only for appearance and serves no practical purpose. Fringing is usually more expensive than either binding or serging.  Trimming, washing, and drying of the carpet – After the weaving, the floor covering is taken off from the loom for its managing. The outside of the carpet is smoothening out by eliminating additional hanging strands. Pointed sharp scissors are utilized for this leveling. This managing draws out the lucidity in the plan of the floor covering. In the wake of managing, the mat is washed with cleanser and later with just with clean water to dispose of all the earth and extra cleanser. A wood board with a sharp edge is utilized to constrain water through mat for better purging. Later the carpet is left under daylight for drying for around four-five days.  Rug shaving and leveling - are again done after mat has totally dried. This upgrades the plan, tones, and levels the mat along its length and breath. This turns out to be the most sensitive piece of the floor covering completing cycle.

 Stretching of this rug – After the leveling, the mat is extended from all the sides with assistance of a metal casing for a day or two to guarantee the specific size and state of the mat.  Protective measurements – The appearance of the carpet is locked and preserved with the use of fluoric-chemicals that protects from discoloration and soiling. These chemicals do not tamper the color or shine of the Indian carpets.  Backing systems – A cushion may be attached to the rug (to which yarn is interweaved through tufting needles) to provide more stability to the structure. In some cases, a bonding adhesive is applied to secure the rug for a longer time. Synthetic latex or vinyl is used to laminate the physical properties of the rug. 5. Project Components: 5.1.

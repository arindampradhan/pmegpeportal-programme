ALOEVERA JUICE Introduction: Aloe Vera, sometimes described as a “wonder plant,” is a short-stemmed shrub. The aloe vera plant is a succulent plant species from the genus Aloe. It grows abundantly in tropical climates and has been used for centuries as a medicinal plant. Aloe Vera juice is an excellent way to keep your liver healthy. That's because the liver functions best when the body is adequately nourished and hydrated. Aloe vera juice is ideal for the liver because it's hydrating and rich in phytonutrients. Aloe Vera contains two hormones: Auxin and Gibberellins. These two hormones provide wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties that reduce skin inflammation. Aloe is soothing and can reduce skin inflammations, blistering and itchiness while helping the skin to heal more rapidly. Uses & Market Potential: India aloe vera market stood at $ 23.72 million in 2017 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 10.02%, in value

Manufacturing Process: The fresh harvested aloe Vera leaves are procured from the local farmer. The timing of the process is important part as leaves show losses of biological activity;beginning at six hours following harvest when the leaves are stored atambient temperature. In the first step, the leaves are fed into washing unit to remove dirt, farm yard waste, aloin content from the leaves. This is a 4 stage washing process. At first stage, water is filled inside steel tanks from pump and leaves are allowed to soak the water for 90 minutes. Along with the soaking in water dirt is removed by brush from the surface of leaves manually by hand or brush. In second stage, the leaves are fed into wash tank filled with mineral water. The mineral water used for cleaning is UV filtered and ozone treated. Calcium hypochlorite is also added in the water of about 0.1 % w/v for disinfection. All the leaves were carefully observed and any infected or damaged leaves were immediately discarded at this stage. At first stage, water is filled inside steel tanks from pump and leaves are allowed to soak the water for 90 minutes. Along with the soaking in water dirt is removed by brush from the surface of leaves manually by hand or brush. In second stage, the leaves are fed into wash tank filled with mineral water. The mineral water used for cleaning is UV filtered and ozone treated. Calcium hypochlorite is also added in the water of about 0.1 % w/v for disinfection. All the leaves were carefully observed and any infected or damaged leaves were immediately discarded at this stage. After this, the sides of the leaves are cut by ½ inch manually using knives. In the next step, Aloe vera leaves are fed into Aloe Vera leaf extractor to remove the upper and lower layer of the leaves to produce fresh gel. After this, the fresh gel is fed into juicer to that grinds the gel to produce juice. The juice obtained is fed into storage tanks through pumps. In the next step, the juice is heated to 50 -70 ℃ temperature and pectolytic enzyme is added into the juice in an amount of 0.06 % w/v. Second class preservatives are also added at this stage. Heating is done for 20 – 25 minutes. After this, the Aloe Vera juice is stored in tank for 12 hours to reduce the viscosity of the juice. After this, juice is filtered to remove foreign materials. In the next step, juice bottles are washed using heated mineral water and dried properly. The juice is filled inside the bottle using juice filling machine in desired quantity. After this, the bottles are packed and dispatched as per required quantity.

Uses & Market Potential: Shatavari is a key ingredient in Ayurvedic medicine. Dried root are used to treat a variety of reproductive and hormonal disorders in women. It's also used to treat indigestion and stomach ulcers. Despite its lengthy history of use in Ayurveda, there is few researches that back up Shatavari health benefits. For farmers in India, commercial cultivation of medicinal plants is one of the most profitable agribusinesses. The cultivation of medicinal herbs such as shankhapushpi, atis, kuth, kutki, kapikachhu, and karanja is transforming the Indian agricultural ayurveda landscape and offering farmers with unprecedented potential to raise their revenues. There are 25 significant medicinal herbs that are always in high demand, according to the traditional treatment health facility. Satavari, Indian Barberry, Liquorice, Bael, Isabgol, Atis, Guggal, Kerth, Aonla, Chandan, Senna, Baiberang, Long Pepper, Brahmi, Jatamansi, Kalmegh, Ashwagandha, Chirata, Katki, Shankhpushpi, Ashoka, Giloe, Kokum, and Safed Musli are among these plants. The market for medical plants in India stood at Rs. 4.2 billion (US$ 56.6 million) in 2019 and is expected to increase at a CAGR 38.5% to Rs. 14 billion (US$ 188.6 million) by 2026. The total world herbal trade is currently assessed at US$ 120 billion. India’s share in the global export of herbs and herbal products is low due to unsophisticated agricultural and quality control procedures, lack of processing, research & development, standardisation in products and regulatory framework in trade of medicinal plants. The export of herbs and value-added extracts of medicinal herbs has been gradually increasing over years. In 2017-2018, India exported US$ 330.18 million worth of herbs at a growth rate of 14.22% over the previous year. Also, exports of value-added extracts of medicinal herbs and herbal products in 2017-2018 stood at US$ 456.12 million, recording a growth rate of 12.23% over the previous year.

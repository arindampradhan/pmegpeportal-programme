HERBAL TOOTHPASTE Introduction: Oral care products are defined as products used for care of the teeth and the mouth. Toothpaste is one of the various products that are available based on their special clinical indications including tooth-whitening products, and denture care materials. Toothpaste is a key part of your daily oral hygiene routine. Along with your toothbrush and floss it helps to remove food debris and plaque from your teeth and gums. Toothpaste polishes your teeth, freshens your breath, and makes you altogether more pleasant to be around. Most toothpaste is a thick paste or gel, a type of dentifrice, or cleaning agent for teeth. Tooth paste is a semi-solid dosage form available in the paste (or) gel forms which have a fortifying effect in the maintaining the health of the teeth and aesthetic effect by ascertaining the abrasive action to the teeth. And also it is used to achieve the suppressive actions like toothache (Dentalgia),Halitosis and Gingivitis (a gum disease) by eliminating the dental plague and food particles from the teeth. The modern statement towards the toothpaste is majority of the cleaning action of the teeth was attained by the mechanical action of the toothbrush rather than the tooth paste. However in our daily routine activities we cannot be separated from tooth brushing with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Tooth brushing activities should be done 2-3 times a day mainly carried out after every meal.

The raw material for toothpaste is procured from the local vendor and stored in the inventory. In the first step, the herbal components extract has been prepared. For this, the Black Pepper, Tomar Seeds, Long Pepper, Babool, Neem, Akarkara are mixed in required proportion and fed into the grinder. The grinder crushes all the components into fine powder. This fine powder is then mixed in RO water tank. The temperature of the tanks is maintained at 100 ℃ so that the water remains in boiling state. Keep the mixture in the same condition for 60 to 100 minutes. Agitators are also used for continuous rotation of powder inside water. This process causes the extraction of herbal contents into water and ionization. After this, filter the water and store the water into tanks. In the next step, this filtered water (20-23 %) is mixed with sodium lauren sulphate (0.5-2 %) in storage tank and mixed thoroughly using agitator. SLS are the surface active agents lower the surface tension, penetrate and loosen surface deposits and emulsify or suspend the debris which the dentifrice removes from the tooth. Water is another essential element of the tooth pastes of this invention. Water employed in the preparation of commercially suitable toothpastes should preferably be deionized and free of organic impurities. In the next step, calcium carbonate having particle size 0.6-30 micron is mixed

with gairic powder. These are the dental abrasives that are used to clean the teeth rubbing over the surface. The abrasives provide the unique benefits of exceptional dental cleaning and polishing performance without unduly abrading tooth enamel ordentin. Another essential component of the toothpaste compositions herein is a humectant. The purpose of humectant is to keep the toothpaste compositions from hardening upon exposure to air. Certain humectants can also impart desirable sweetness or flavor to toothpaste compositions. The humectant over here is sorbitol. Sorbitol is also added in a concentration level of 25-30% in this mixer. Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol that is added in above mixture to keep in semi-solid form. The agitator continuously rotates the mixture to keep the concentration uniform. In the next step, the paste mixture and the water is collected in Toothpaste vacuum mixing machine from the different tanks and collectively mixed. Now flavors are added as per requirement in the paste mixture. After this, the paste is stored in storage tanks. In the next step, paste is filled in the tubes in required weight and sealed by using automatic paste filling and sealing machine. Date and other specifications are printed over the tubes using printing machine. After this,they are packed and dispatched as per the required quantity. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Civil work cost will be Rs. 4 Lac (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1

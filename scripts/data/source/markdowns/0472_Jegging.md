JEGGING Introduction Jeggings are leggings that are made to look like skin-tight denim jeans. The word is a portmanteau of the words jeans and leggings. Jeggings were brought on by the resurgence in style of skinny jeans in the late 2000s, when a higher demand for a tighter style of pants came about. Since jeggings are typically made of a cotton/spandex blend, (cotton being the primary fibre in most denim, a kind of serge), they are often worn on their own as opposed to under a skirt or dress. Some jeggings have front fastening facilities while others just have an elastic waistband and no pockets. With respect to material, Jeggings fall into two main categories: 1. Jeggings that are legging material, i.e. a knit, made to look like denim with fake pockets and belt loops. 2. Jeggings that are a true cross between denim and legging material. "Denim jeggings" are essentially a denim fabric with the elasticity of a legging, due to a higher proportion of Spandex in the fibre content. The latter are more similar to skinny jeans than the former. Some designers call "denim jeggings" pull-on jeans rather than jeggings. Fashion Trend Jeggings entered the fitness world in early 2010, and were among the most popular clothing items of 2010, according to business reporting. Many opt to wear jeggings in order to give the legging feel as well as the jean appearance. Qualities of good Jegging 1. Active wear- they allow the wearer to move easily. 2. They Will Not Rip or Tear easily. 3. They help keep the wearer dry & Fresh. 4. Jeggings wearing appearance looks good.

Jeggings Market Analysis Among Indian women, jeans, jegging or denim trousers are the most popular articles. Women across different age brackets and spanning all shapes and sizes like to wear denim as it is comfortable, functional and durable. Denim is also gaining popularity in athleisure form among women owing to the comfort provided by stretch denims. Women who are not at ease with western wear have taken up wearing jeans by pairing them with Indian ethnic wear like Kurtis. This mix and match style is gradually picking up, particularly among women in small towns and those who come from a traditional background and is likely to further fuel the growth of the segment. This segment is expected to grow the fastest at the CAGR of 17.5 per cent.

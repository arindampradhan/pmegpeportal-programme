TYRE POLISH UNIT Introduction Polishing is the process of creating a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant specular reflection (still limited by the index of refraction of the material according to the Fresnel equations.) In some materials (such as metals, glasses, black or transparent stones), polishing is also able to reduce diffuse reflection to minimal values. When an unpolished surface is magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those "mountains" are worn down until they are flat or just small "hills." The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones. Tyre Polish is used to create a smooth & shiny tyre by using different types of chemicals. Advantages of tyre polishing When vehicle's tyre isn't smooth. It has a texture to it, and if it has been washed with harsh detergents and dried improperly, it may even have minor surface scratches. The Advantage to using tyre polish after washing is that because they are slightly abrasive polishes will remove, remove minor scratches, and smooth imperfections in the tyre. Where wax lays down a layer of protection, polish removes material to reveal clean smooth tyre. The smoother the tyre, the shinier the surface. The typical reason of using tyre polish is to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum in the tyre without stripping out so much as to make tyre undamaged.

Ingredients Main ingredient of tyre polish is glycerine. Other essential ingredients include salt (Glucose syrup), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrances. Description of Tyre polish Machine Machinery for Tyre polish Unit includes the following:  Double Hot Blender machine  Filler Machine These Machines are used to produce tyre polish substance from the raw material. With the help of this machine the work of mixing, formulation & blending completes in a very short span. Tyre Polish Market Analysis The Indian tyre industry may log 7-9 per cent growth over the next five year backed by favourable outlook for the domestic automotive industry, rating agency ICRA said in a note earlier. ICRA, in the note also forecast the industry to see a capital expenditure of around Rs 20,000 crore during this period. Besides, the domestic tyre industry margins, which declined by 120 bps year-on-year in the September quarter, are expected to improve in the second half of the current fiscal due to the falling crude prices and stable prices of the natural rubber, it said. With the increasing demand of tyre industry in India, demand for tyre polishing is also increasing day by day, due to maintenance of the tyres for the long run.

ALKYD RESIN Introduction: Alkyd resins are any of a large group of thermoset resins that are essentially Polyesters made by heating polyhydric alcohol with polybasic acids or their anhydride and used chiefly in making protective coatings with good weathering properties. These resins are useful as film forming agents in paint, varnished and enamels & as thermosetting plastics that can be moulded into solid objects. Hence, alkyd resins are one of the important ingredients in the synthetic paint industry. The paint factories in India currently produce a variety of paint which can broadly be categorized as synthetic enamel. This type of paint is used for the exclusive use in internal / exterior walls and ceilings of architecture. This type consists of alkyd based products which are used as metallic & wood paints, varnishes & lacquers, antirust, etc. Market Potential: Alkyd resin, which is used in the production of a wide variety of paints, is supplied to the Indian market both from domestic production and import. As Indian industries are producing paint of amount approximately Rs.15000 crores which needs Alkyd Resin of amount near

about Rs. 3000 crores. Due to construction of apartments, buildings, roads there is huge demand of paint in this sector. Increased demand of paint will need the basic raw material of paint i.e. alkyd resin simultaneously. Raw Material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Linseed oil 2. Penta Erythriol 3. Pthalic anhydride 4. Litharge 5. Xylene 6. Barrel Machinery Requirement: Major machinery & equipments are as follows: S No. Description Qty.

Manufacturing Process: Two processes are used for the production of alkyd resins, namely the solvent and the fusion process. The solvent process uses a small amount of solvent, 5- 10%, in the etherification reaction to act as a reflux medium. The advantages of this process are:  Uniformity of Product  Increased speed of reaction and lower material losses.  Light Color In the solvent process, the production of alkyds can be carried out either in a single stage or a two stage process. Under the single stage process, the drying oil (linseed oil), polyalcohol and phthalic anhydride are converted simultaneously. This method of alkyd preparation is not satisfactory because of the incompatibility of the phthalic anhydride with drying oil (linseed oil) and the difficulty of controlling the reaction to produce the desired end- products. In the first stage of the two stage solvent process, monoglyceride is produced from drying oil and polyalcohol and in the second stage the monoglyceride is esterified with phthalic anhydride to convert it into alkyd resin. This process is more satisfactory and is the one recommended for the envisaged plant because it eliminates the problems of the first option. In the two- stage solvent process, the first operation is the alcholoysis reaction which takes place under different duration of time (varying form 40 minutes to 4 hours) and temperature (from about 240 to 260o C). The completion of this stage is shown by the solubility of the product in about twice its weight of methanol. Monoglyceride formation is checked by solubility method with methanol in the ratio 1:3. The confirmation test is done by compatibility test in which monoglyceride is heated separately in small quantity with pthalic anhydride and heated up to 225 degree Celsius. The reaction product is diluted with MTO to infinite.

Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 30 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 9 including 1 Supervisor, 1 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 1 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person. Bank Term Loan: Rate of Interest is assumed to be at 11% Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated as per the Provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961

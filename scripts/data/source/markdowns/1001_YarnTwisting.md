YARN TWISTING Introduction Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textile, sewing, knitting, crocheting, weaving, embroidery or ropemaking. Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing. Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework. Yarn Twisting Twisting is a very essential process in the production of staple yarn, twine, cord and ropes. Twist is inserted to the staple yarn to hold the constituent fibres together, thus giving enough strength to the yarn, and also producing a continuous length of yarn. The twist in the yarn has a two-fold effect; firstly the twist increases cohesion between the fibres by increasing the lateral pressure in the yarn, thus giving enough strength to the yarn. Secondly, twist increases the helical angle of fibres and prevents the ability to aooly the maximum fibre strength to the yarn. Due to the above effects, as the twist increases, the yarn strength increases up to a certain level, beyond which the increase in twist actually decreases the strength of staple yarn. The continuous filament yarn also requires a small amount of

twist in order to avoid the fraying of filaments and to increase abrasion resistance. Yarn is often ply-twisted in a direction opposite to a single yarn twist to improve evenness, strength, elongation, bulkiness, lustre and abrasion resistance, and to reduce twist liveliness, hairiness and variation in strength. The process of twisting is an indispensable means of improving certain yarn properties and satisfying textile requirements that cannot be fulfilled by the single yarns. The method of twisting two or more single yarns is called doubling or folding or ply twisting. Such yarns are designated as doubled yarn, folded yarn or plied yarn and the machines intended for the purpose are called doublers, ply-twisters or two-for-one (TFO) twisters. Categories of yarn twisting On the basis of the degree of twist, the spun yarn can be classified in three categories: 1. Low twist yarn 2. Normal twist yarn 3. High twist yarn 1. Low twist Yarn: This type of yarn contains less degree of the twist than standard. It has bulkiness and soft feel. It possess less strength than normal twist yarn. It shows poor lustre and less Clarity in the structure. It looks coarser than normal twist yarn. Pilling properties of fabrics made of this yarn are poor. 2. Normal Twist yarn: This type of yarn has a normal twist as per spinning norms and specification.

3. High Twisted yarn: This type of yarn contains a higher degree of twist than standard. This yarn has a rough feel. This yarn increases the clarity of the texture of the fabric. It possess higher strength than normal twist yarn. It shows good lustre in comparison of normal twist yarn. Yarn looks finer than normal twist yarn. It has better pilling properties. Yarn Market analysis The yarn, fiber and thread manufacturing market expected to reach a value of nearly $123.39 billion by 2022, significantly growing at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period. The growth in the yarn, fiber and thread manufacturing market is due to emerging markets growth, rise in disposable income, technology development. However, the market for yarn, fiber and thread manufacturing is expected to face certain restraints from several factors such as lack of available resources, workforce issues and increasing inventory levels.

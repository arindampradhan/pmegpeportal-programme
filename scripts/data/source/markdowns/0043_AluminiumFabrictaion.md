ALUMINIUM FABRICATION Introduction: Aluminum fabricated items like doors, windows, staircase, hand rails and supports, railings for verandas, corridors etc. have become that standard accepted feature in most modern buildings. The use of aluminum in business and office complexes , buildings, theatres ,auditorium is very extensive for functional as well as decorative purposes. Similarly in residential buildings also aluminum doors, windows, railings, grill works etc. are used extensively. Textile shops and other trading shops in lighter materials too are going in for shelves made of aluminum for tacking purposes. Uses & Market Potential: The many advantages of aluminum such as lightweight, strength, corrosion resistance, durability, ease in fabrication, attractive appearance and easy maintenance make it a popular material for use in modern building. Aluminum required for use in buildings are available from large scale manufacturers-such as Balco, Jindal, Hindalco etc. as extruded sections in various shapes and sizes for specific uses. These sections are also available through their local dealers. The usual length of these sections is 12 ft. 24 meters. Fabricators anodized these to desired colours and fabricate the

items as per the customer’s requirements. These items have good appearance and finish and the maintenance expenses are almost nil while steel and wooden items require regular painting and polishing periodically. The development and construction activities being interlinked, there is good scope for aluminium fabrication units for meeting the growing demand of new building for offices, business and shopping complexes theatres etc. Aluminium fabricated and anodized items like doors, windows, railings, staircases, shelves; ladders, etc. are being increasingly used in the modern constructions on considerations of durability and appearance. In the present trend , theatres restaurants, hotels, shopping complexes, office premises and other luxurious building are fast replacing wooden materials with aluminium-fabricated items. The consumption of these items is on the increase. Raw material: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Aluminium Extruded Sections such as Book Type Hand Rail 100 mm size 2. 25 mm sq. Pipe 3. Flat with different sections 4. Handle Section for Doors 5. Clips 6. Glass sheet 7. Chemical for anodizing 8. Other consumables such as Hinges, Screws, Bolts, Locks, etc. Machinery Requirements: Major machines & equipments are as follows: S No. Description Qty. Amount 1. Heavy duty cut off machine with 2HP motor, 1 40000 starter, etc 2. Drilling machine 12mm cap with 0.5 HP 1 17000 Motor 3. Portable Electric Drill 2 6000 4. Double ended Bench Grinder 200 mm dia. 1 11000 With 0.75 HP Motor 5. Anodising Plant complete with Rectifier and 1 850000 necessary tanks of 14ft. length and initial chemicals

6. Other equipments & hand tools Ls 50000 Net Amount 974000 Net Amount (Round off) 980000 Manufacturing Process: Manufacturing Process involves anodizing the aluminium-extruded sections first and then fabrication. Anodising process involves buffing, pickling, in acid solution then cleaning in water, neutralizing in chemical and keeping the extruded sections in anodizing tank for specified time. These are again washed in water and dried in sun or by any other means. After anodizing the sections are to be fabricated as per design and sizes of customers by cutting, bending, joining by screwing or riveting, assembling with glass/board and beading wherever necessary. Handles, locks, tower bolts, stoppers etc. are also fitted as per requirements. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 1500 to 2000Sqft. Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 25 Hp Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 11 including 1 Supervisor, 2 Plant operator, 2 unskilled worker, 2 Helper and 1 Security guard. 3 Skilled worker including Accountant, Manager and Sales person.

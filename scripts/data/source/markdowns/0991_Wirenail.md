PROJECT REPORT ON WIRE NAILS INTRODUCTION: Iron nail is one hardware that is used mainly in Building construction work, manufacturing boxes for packing etc. due to the increasing population and the necessities attached to it, they are always in demand in the market. The most important aspect about the manufacturing of this product is that the brand is not important as far as iron nails are concerned hence entrepreneurs can go for the manufacturing at district or tehsil level. Keeping the quality standards in mind, and they could be on the road to success. For the purpose of marketing one can contact hardware store and the stores that keep stuff related to building construction. MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF NAILS: Two types of machines are required to manufacture nails (i) Crank type (ii) Spring type. Out of these maintenance cost and are automatic. Cold drawn, bright wire is used to make nails, and this wire is available in various gauges (20 S. W. G. to 65 W. G.). These wires are found in round bundles, one end of the wire is fixed in tool stand and then the other is put in wire straightening rollers and the wire automatically reaches the machine. To pull the wire further ahead, there is a grip after the rollers and this grip pulls only as much wire as is needed for the specific of the nail. The head of the gh the crank shot. 2

The front end of the wire is hit hard by the punch attached to the head-making mould. To make the other end and then cutting of the nail is done automatically. Here the moulds press the wire and nail gets bifurcated & cut from the wire. In this way, some part of the nail is still attached to the wire and an automatic trigger separates the nail from the wire. When the nails come out of the machine, then the tiny bits of iron & grease/lubricant deposited on the nails are remoulded by putting them into a polishing drum in which iron balls and dust are also put and after the polish, they are sent to the markets in jute bags. The details of the gauges of the wire, etc. required to manufacture various sizes of the nails are mentioned below:  Nails of the length ranging from ½ inch to 2 inches wire gauge:- 20 to 12 S. W. G; capacity of machines, etc. 400 nails per minute; electric motor of 2 H. P.  Nails of length ranging from ¾ to 3 inches wire gauge:- 14 to 9 S. W. G.; capacity of the machines:- 300 nails/minute and 350 kg. nails per day. Electric motor of 3 H. P.  Nails of length ranging from 1 to 4 inches wire gauge:- 12 to 6 S. W. G.; capacity of the machine; 200 nails/minute and 650 kg nail/day. Electric motor of 5 H. P. Wire fixing Wire Readymad Polishing Polish on reel nail e Nails drum on nails stand making Sale s PRODUCTION CAPACITY: The production target has been kept as 345000 kg per annum (size : ¾- 3 Inches) . MOTIVE POWER :5 HP 3

BASIS & PRESUMPTIONS: 1. The basis for calculation of production capacity is on single shift basis, working of 25 days per month on 60 % efficiency. The required for achieving envisaged capacity utilization is assumed as one year. 2. BEP for the scheme has been calculated on full capacity utilization. 3. Rate of interest has been taken as 10% on an average. This, however, is likely to vary depending upon the financial outlay of the location of the project. 4. Labour wages have been taken on the basis of minimum applicable. There are likely to change depending upon the location of the project. 5. The cost of machinery and equipments as indicated in the scheme are approximate those ruling at the time of preparation of the scheme. The entrepreneur may check the exact price for specific make and model of the machine selected. 6. The provision made in other respects viz; raw materials, utilities, overheads etc. are drawn on the basis of standard variation and output. The cost indicated against each is approximate and based on local market condition and observations. The entrepreneur may find out the exact cost from the concerned sources.

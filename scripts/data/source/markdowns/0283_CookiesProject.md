COOKIES Introduction A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes "dunked", an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars,[4] while also softening their texture. Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked. Classification of cookies There are six different types of cookies, which are classified by the way the dough is handled. These types are: drop, bar, rolled, refrigerator, pressed and molded, which are described as follows: 1. Bar cookies consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in multiple layers) and cut into cookie- sized pieces after baking. In British English, bar cookies are known as "tray bakes". Examples include brownies, fruit squares, and bars such as date squares. 2. Drop cookies are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. During baking, the mounds of

dough spread and flatten. This may also include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip. 3. Molded cookies are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by hand before baking. Snickerdoodles and peanut butter cookies are examples of molded cookies. Some cookies, such as hermits or biscotti, are molded into large flattened loaves that are later cut into smaller cookies. 4. Pressed cookies are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a cookie press into various decorative shapes before baking. Spritzgebäck is an example of a pressed cookie. 5. Refrigerator cookies (also known as icebox cookies) are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to make the raw dough even stiffer before cutting and baking. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. Pinwheel cookies and those made by Pillsbury are representative. 6. Rolled cookies are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Gingerbread men are an example. Health benefits of cookies  Gives a sense of satisfaction: When you eat some cake, cookies or any other treat, you will feel full. This is because there are carbohydrates in the cookie dough that causes satiety in the stomach. It's almost like when you eat rice or pasta and feel full almost instantly.  Adds energy: Cookies are the perfect snack if you have a lot of activity in the morning. So, bake that Cookie Dough and feel refreshed, ready to take on the day!  Metabolism and body cells: To produce a stable metabolism, you need protein. A good metabolism means that the process of digesting food is optimal and you will get your body healthier. Protein becomes a good intake to produce and replace damaged cells in the body so don't worry about the flour, it's doing some good!  Improving bone health: To nourish your bones, calcium and potassium need to be taken in. Cookie dough has moderate levels of

potassium so bake that dough and dip it in some milk. That's right, the delicious treat can prevent osteoporosis. Certainly a win-win situation.  Maintaining brain health: Potassium in cookie dough also maintains the health of the brain. It is crucial because it helps carry oxygen to the brain and works so the nerves are working effectively. Cookies Market Analysis India biscuit market stood at $ 3.9 billion in 2016, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.27%, in value terms, during 2017-2022, to reach $ 7.25 billion by 2022. Rising number of health-conscious consumers, expanding working population and increasing urbanization are boosting the country’s biscuit market. Moreover, augmenting disposable income along with changing lifestyle, increasing awareness regarding healthy diet and change in food consumption pattern are some of the other factors expected to propel demand for biscuits over the course of next five years. The global cookies market size was valued at USD 30.62 billion in 2018 and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2019 to 2025. Growing product popularity, especially in emerging regions, is expected to be the key factor fueling the market growth. Moreover, high demand for chocolate cookies in developed economies like U. S., Germany, and U. K. will boost the market further. Bakery manufacturers attract customers with innovative packaging solutions and by launching new flavor variants, such as pineapple. Rising disposable income in emerging economies including China and India is projected to drive the product demand over the years to come. Rising product popularity as gifting option is also projected to boost the demand. Oats and digestive ingredients are the major ingredients in cookies. Description of Machinery & Equipment Following machineries are required for Cookies manufacturing process:  Planetary mixer  Sugar grinder  Dropping machine

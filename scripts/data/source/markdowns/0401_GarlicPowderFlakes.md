PROJECT REPORT O N GARLIC FLAKES AND POWDER (DEHYDRATED) Garlic is most commonly used as a condiment and for flavouring and seasoning of food products such as soups, dals, pickles, etc It is also used for flavouring vinegar or oil for dressing. Incorporation of garlic in the diet at moderate levels is likely to shift the balance of the microflora in the intestines in favour of lactic organisms, which generally have a favourable effect on the absorption of minerals present in the diet. Garlic has a pungent smell due to the presence of unsaturated sulphides. Several methods have been patented for the deodourization of garlic. An odour-free strain of garlic has been developed in Japan by continuous selection breeding. This strain tastes and smells like garlic until it is eaten, when for still unknown reasons, the odour disappears. This mutant strain of garlic does not revert to its original"smelly" strain even after six generations. Garlic is endowed with several medicinal properties. It is stimulant, diaphoretic, expectorant, diuretic and tonic. It is rubefacient when applied externally. It is used as an anthelminitic and emmenagogue. The juice of garic is used for various ailments of the stomach including amoebic dysentery. It is also used as an anti-tubercular drug, and in the treatment of epilepsy. It is reported to be anticholeric. Garlic reduces the blood sugar levels. It is an anti-fertility drug showing oxytocic activity. B. I. S.

IS -------3240 (1965) Garlic MARKET SURVEY 1. USERS Homes, Restaurants, Hotels & Institutions, food processing industries, snacks manufacturers. 2. SALE CHANNELS & METHODS Selling would be made direct to wholesalers or to distributors or to general merchants. 3. GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENT OF MARKET A. DOMESTIC: Since these products are used in homes and wherever food is served or prepared, the geographical extent of the market would be nationwide. The product is well packaged and cost of shipping would not be prohibitive in comparison with the sale value of the product. B. EXPORT MARKET: These products are sold world wide and this industry should not experience great difficulty in selling its product in the export market. As of a higher quality product is required to be exported. 4. COMPETITION:- A. DOMESTIC: Since a sizable investment is required to produce this product, the principal competition that could be encountered would be from other local plants producing the same products. B. EXPORT MARKET: If the garlics are available locally & this plant is well managed and efficiently operated, it should have little difficulty in competing with other manufacturing. 5. MARKET NEEDED FOR PLANT The market needed for this industry will depend to some extent on the per capita income. Under normal conditions, it is estimated that the population of the million would consume the output of this plant. However, the plant should experience little difficulty in exporting any surplus production. Garlic powder is one of the important ingredients of spices industries. It comes under the category of seed spices. So now we are describing here about the spices industries market position. Spices are used worldwide to add taste and flavor to the food. They are also known as appetizers and were considered essential in the culinary skill. Spices add a tang of flavor to otherwise insipid food stuff and act as flavor disguisers. Some of the spices possess anti oxidant properties. Some spices are also used in pharmaceuticals cosmetics and perfumery industries. India is known to be the home of spices. Indian spices famous for aroma and flavor have established their own importance in the domestic and international markets. India, being the traditional home of spices, almost all known spices namely, pepper, cardamom,chillies, ginger, turmeric, saffirb are produced in the country. Because of the importance of Indian spices in international market this study is an attempt to analyse the trend in production, export market and future prospect of spices in Indian domestic as well as in export market.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS The manufacturing process of dehydrated garlic flakes requires the following operations. 1. Washing 2. Peeling 3. Sulphitation 4. Packaging WASHING The fresh garlic as obtained from the vegetable market includes many contaminants like soil, leaves of other vegetables etc. It is very essential to wash the garlic purchased from the market before proceeding to any other process. The washing operation is performed by water spraying or in rotary washers. PEELING The outer leaves of garlic after washing are removed by peeling operation. Water sprayers used in first step assist peeling besides loosening the dirt. Peeling may be effected by steaming, radiant heat, or by heating over gas flames & tumbling in washer flame. the last technique is used for peeling of onion & garlics. In small scale units, hand operated peeling machine are used for removing the outer layers of garlic. The peeling process is again followed by the washing by spraying water. SULPHITATION Prior to dehydration, another operation is sometimes performed with certain limitations. This process is known as sulphitation. A small amount of potassium metabisulfite solution is prepared and sliced garlic are dipped in it for 2-3 minutes. Then slicesare removed from solution. Sulphitation greatly prolongs the storage life of vegetables. garlics & onions, but treatment reduces their pungency. Sulphitation also protects the garlic and other vegetables against scorching damage during dehydration. DEHYDRATION The modern process of dehydration consists of the removal of moisture from garlic by the application of heat usually in the presence of controlled flow of air. If the air used in drying garlic is allowed to escape into the atmosphere after it passage through the dehydrator, a great deal of heat is lost. The garlic may become overdried if the spent air is recirculated in larger quantities. This condition is avoided to a large extent of the relative humidity of the air is increased sufficiently, which can be done to a large degree by return of some of the spent air. Because of these facts, it is customary in modern dehydrators to provide for recirculation of a portion of air used in drying. The air in the dehydrator should be so furnished as to be applied to the product to be dried in evenly distributed manner. By placing baffles on the walls of the dehydrator or on the trolleys it is possible to force the air into the desired channels. Various types of dehydrtors are available commercially and used for the dehydration techniques : 1. Kiln Drier. 2. Tower or stack Drier.

3. Oregon Tunnel Drier. 4. Vaccum Dehydrator. 5. Forced draft tunnel dehydrator. 6. Circulating Air Blast type funnels dehydrator. Various types of tray dryers are in use which vary greatly in size design and materials of the construction. The trays used for garlic dehydration are of 6' x 3' size with wooden slot bottoms. The tray load is about 1 1/4 Lb/sq.ft. Garlic is dried to 8% moisture in dehydrators. The drying is completed in bins at 45-50o C to obtain moisture less than 6.5%. Pulverising:- The dried flakes are pulverised to required mesh size and send for packaging. PACKAGING:- The packing of garlic flakes is done completely in hermetically seaked container, so that no air from ovtside will ro into the package and no air from inside will come out of the package. The product will remain good for a longer period. STORAGE:- The product after packaging in hergaticlly sealed container or Nitrogen gas flushed pouches, is now stored at low temperature.(10-12o) to prevent the product from non- enzymatic browning reaction. The product will remain good in low temperature storage conditions. Tunnel Driers :- These driers are the most common in use for dehydrating fruits and vegetables. They consist of tunnels 10 to 20 m long into which trucks containing the trays of food are placed. Hot air is blown across the trays. Production is scheduled so that when a truck of finished product is removed from one end of the tunnel,a truck of fresh produce is put in the other end. Air movement may be in the same direction as the movement of the product (parallel flow). This has the advantage that the hottest air contacts the wettest product, therefore hotter air can be used. On the other hand, the air at the outlet end becomes cool and moisture lader and the final product may not be sufficiently dry. The air movement may be in the opposite direction of the material flow. In this case the hot dry air contacts the driest product first so that a very dry product can be obtained. Care must be taken not to overload the drier as the moist charge may stand in the warm, moisture air too long without being dried to any extent. This would allow time for product spoilage. On the other hand, the dry product should not be left in the drier too long since it is in contact with the hottest air and could become overheated. In general, the counter flow tunnel uses less heat and produces a drier product than a parallel flow tunnel. In some cases the two types of tunnels are combined into one unit. The product is first placed in a parallel tunnel to take advantage of the high initial rate of drying. It can then be placed in a counter current tunnel to get a very dry end product. In operation of these tunnels, the drying conditions are not constant. When a fresh tra of material is put into the tunnel, the air which reaches the air-exist-end of the tunnel may be cooler and wetter at the beginning of the cycle than at the end of the cycle. There will be a rise in the air-inlet-end is dried.

In some tunnels a moving conveyor is used instead of trucks and trays. This has the advantage of reducing labor cost and of having more uniform drying conditions. However, a larger installation and investment are required.

PROJECT PROFILE ON ‘ASSEMBLY OF AUTO CLUTCH PLATE ’ PRODUCT AND ITS USES: Clutch is most important part of any Automobile vehicle. The function of this part is to engage or disengage the engine from the transmission line at the will of its Driver. The clutch plate is placed in- between the engine and transmission line and operates on the principle of friction. MARKET POTENTIALITY: Now a day the automobile vehicles have become an important means of transport due to liberalization of economy, increase in purchase power of people & easily availability of car loans & other transport loans on lower rate of Interest. Almost all vehicles require auto clutch plates which workout after a lapse of time and requires replacement. All the districts of Utter Pradesh are well connected by road transport and transportation of goods as well as public are totally dependent on auto vehicles. Hence the vehicles requirement is increasing day by day, which intern will require auto clutch plates for repair/replacement, so the demand of this item is expected to be of high order in near future. The proposed unit may also contact big automobile manufacturing units to fetch their requirement as per their demand.

BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS: i) The basis for calculation of production capacity on maximum capacity utilization has been taken on single shift basis for 300 days a year. During first year, second year and third year of operations the capacity utilization is 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% respectively. The unit is expected to achieve full capacity utilization from the fourth year onward. ii) The salaries and wages, cost of raw materials, utilities, rents etc. are based on the prevailing rates in and around Allahabad. These cost factors are likely to vary with time and location. iii) Interest on term loan and working capital loan has been taken 11.00% per Annum. iv) The cost of machinery and equipment as indicated in the scheme are approximate of these ruling at the time of preparation of scheme. Entrepreneur may check up the latest and exact price for specific make and model of the machine selected. v) It is presumed that unit will get full capacity within five years. vi) It is presumed that operative period of unit will be 10 years. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE: The major activities in the implementation of the project have been listed below and the average time for implementation of the project is estimated at 6 months: Work schedule Period (in months)  Preparation of project report 1  Registration and other formalities 1  Sanction of loan by financial institutions 1  Plant & Machinery a) Placement of orders b) Procurement 1 c) Power connection/Electrification 1 d) Installation/Erection of machinery/ Test equipment 1  Procurements of raw material 1  Recruitment of Technical Staff etc. 1  Trial Production Commercial Production 1 1.

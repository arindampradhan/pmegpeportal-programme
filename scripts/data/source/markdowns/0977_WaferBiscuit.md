PROJECT PROFILE WAFER BISCUITS INTRODUCTION Bakery industry in India is the largest of the food industries with an annual turnover of about 3000 cores. India is the second largest producer of biscuits after USA. The biscuits industry in india comprises of organized and unorganized sectors. Bread and biscuits form the major baked foods accounting for over 80% of total bakery products produced in the country. The quantities of bread and biscuits are more than bread. The industry has traditionally been and largely continues to be in the unorganized sector contributing over 70% of the total production. Bakery products once considered as sick man’s diet have now become an essential food items of the vast majority of population. Though bakery industry in India has been in existence since long, real fillip came only in the later part of 20th century. The contributing factors were urbanization, resulting in increased demand for ready to eat products at reasonable costs etc.

MARKET POTENTIAL The bakery units are unevenly spread among states. These are mainly concentrated in the states of Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Industrially advanced states like Maharashtra and West Bengal have very large number of bakery units. The per capita consumption is very high in industrialized states like Maharashtra and West Bengal. The biscuits are becoming quite popular in rural areas as well. Nearly 55 % of the biscuits are becoming quite popular in rural areas as well. Nearly 55% of the biscuits are consumption of biscuits in rural area could be attributed to its position as a snack, longer shelf life and better taste which is liked by different cross sections of populations. There is no marketing problem as every shop is a market for wafer biscuits. Bakery products still remain the cheapest of the processed ready to eat products in the country. The production of bakery products has increased from 5.19 lakh tones in 1975 to 18.95 lakh tones in 1990 recording fourfold increase in 15 years. Among the bakery products, biscuits occupy an important place as they contribute over 33% of total products processed. Over 79 % of the biscuits are produced by small scale sector consisting of both factory and non-factory units. The growth rate for bakery products is estimated at an average of 9.8% per future. The estimated growth rate of 9.8 % is on the lower side considering the present potentiality of bakery precuts, particularly in rural areas, where about 70% of the population lives. Trends in consumption of bakery products by population of lower- and middle-income groups indicate vast scope for consideration of nutritional enrichment of bakery products. BASIS AND PRESUMPTIONS 1. The project profile has been prepared on the basis of single shift of 8 hours a day and 25 working days in a month at 60% efficiency. 2. It is presumed that in the first year, the capacity utilization will be 70 % followed by 80% in the second year with 100% in the fifth years. 3. The rate of salaries and wages for skilled workers and others are on the basis of the minimum rates 4. Interest rate for the fixed and working capital has been taken @ 11.50% on an average whether financed by the bankers or financial institutions. 5. The margin money required is the minimum 10% of the total capital investment.

6. The rates in respect of machinery, equipment and raw materials are those prevailing at the time of preparation of the projects profile and are likely to vary from place to place and supplier to supplier. When a tailor-made project profile is prepared, Necessary changes are to be made. 7. The payback period may be 5 years after the initial gestation period. 8. The gestation period in implementation of the project may be to the tune of 6 to 9 months which includes making all formalities, market surveys and tie-ups etc. TECHNICAL ASPECTS PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE The main product of the unit wafer biscuits can be manufactured after obtaining raw materials like maida, starch, soda, salt, color, preservatives, vanaspati, sugar, flavors etc. Which are easily available in local markets? The calculated amount of maida, starch, vanaspati, water etc. is mixed in a mixer to form paste. The paste so formed will be poured into pre-heated mould to bake wafer sheet. The other ingredients like sugar, vanaspati, colors, essence are mixed in a planetary mixer to form cream. The cream so prepared will be applied on the sheets to form sandwich. Thereafter the sandwich will be cut into biscuits and packed in pouches. PRODUCTION CAPACITY 1 Production of creamed wafer biscuits 60 MT 2 Value of creamed –wafer biscuits at 100% Capacity Rs. 77.61lac PA MOTIVE POWER - 25 K. W. ENERGY CONSERVATION The following steps may be taken for the conservation of energy: 1. Machinery and equipment parts which are revolving and reciprocating should be properly, lubricated from time to time with suitable lubricant oil. 2. Lay out of the unit should be in such a way that no back tracking of material is there. 3. All electric switches may be turned off when not required. 4. The entire transmission belt will be tightened before starting the work is wherever applicable. 5. As far as possible, solar energy and day light will be used keeping all the other lights off. 6. As far as possible, inductive load of motor will be reduced and high-power factor will be used with the aid of capacitors of appropriate sizes.

POLLUTION CONTROL 1 . This industry may involve pollution to some extent for which state pollution control board has to be approached. 2 . The minimum height of shed will be maintained with exhaust fans installed for removing decongestion, proper ventilation, removal of cokes, fumes etc. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE The implementation of the project includes various jobs/exercises such as procurement of technical know-how, market surveys and tie-ups, preparation of project report, selection of site, registration, financing of project, procurement of machinery and raw materials etc, Recruitment of staff erection/ commissioning of machines, trial production and commercial production etc. In order to efficiently and successfully implement the project in the shortest period, simultaneous exercises are carried out. Project implementation will take a period of 8 months from the date of approval of the scheme.

BAMBOO TREE GUARD Introduction: A tree shelter, or tree guard, is a type of shelter used to nurture trees in the early stages of their growth. Tree shelters are also sometimes known as Tuley tubes or tree tubes. The purpose of tree shelters is to protect young trees from browsing by herbivores by forming a physical barrier along with providing a barrier to chemical spray applications. Additionally, tree tubes accelerate growth by providing a mini-greenhouse environment that reduces moisture stress, channels growth into the main stem and roots and allows efficient control of weeds that can rob young seedlings of soil moisture and sunlight.

Uses & Market Potential: Bamboos can be used to protect trees and they also allow sufficient sunlight facilitating plant growth. As plastic is getting banned and plastic related products were earlier used to protect trees and plant from getting damaged so now to be eco-friendly tree guard made of bamboos are used widely and protect plants and trees from getting damaged and also protect them from animals. The cost of cement guard is nearly three times that of bamboo tree guard. The material factor in the labour material ratio for roadside plantation is on the higher side. In cement or brick tree guards the plants do not get sufficient sunlight, therefore there is poor photosynthesis in the plant, resulting in poor survival and growth of plants. Therefore, more and more tree guard made up of bamboos are used these days. Machinery & equipments: Major machines are as follows: Name Unit Price Band saw Machine 1 195000 Wood Ripening Machine(Seasoning Plant) 1 185000 Nail Gun 1 13000 Glue Spreading Machine 1 85000 Other carpentry tools Ls 22000 Raw materials: Major raw materials are as follows: 1. Bamboo 2. Other consumables such as Glue, oil, nail, etc. Assuming average raw material cost 60-70 per set. Manufacturing Process: All bamboo and materials required for production are procured from local vendors. Bamboos are initially cut to manageable sizes using carpenter saws and similar tools and machines. The

bamboos are then cleaned of all unwanted materials like leaves & protrude at nodes. Bamboos then as per requirement are seasoned in a seasoning plant as per tree guard to be made though many guards can be made with almost no to minor processing. Bamboos either way are allowed to disperse a portion of their moisture content before actual manufacturing of tree guard starts. The next step prior to manufacturing is surface cleaning & smoothening of bamboo using sand paper, tough bamboo is fundamentally smooth, but during processing fibers can exposed, scratches can be formed which are not desirable hence smoothened with sand paper or appropriate machines. Then bamboos are cut in appropriate sizes as per guard to be made, these parts are assembled into tree guard utilizing a combination of nails, glue etc. All the edges of assembled product are once again smoothened prior to its dispatch for sale. Area: The industrial setup requires space for Inventory, workshop or manufacturing area, space for power supply utilities and auxiliary like Generator setup. Also some of the area of building is required for office staff facilities, documentation, office furniture, etc. Thus, the approximate total area required for complete industrial setup is 800 to 1200Sqft. Civil work cost will be around 4 Lac Rs. (Approx.) Power Requirement: The power consumption required to run all the machinery could be approximated as 20hp. Manpower Requirement: There are requirement of skilled machine operators to run the machine set. Experience quality engineers are required for desired quality control. Some helpers are also required to transfer the material from one work station to other. Office staffs are required to maintain the documentation. The approximate manpower required is 7 including 1
